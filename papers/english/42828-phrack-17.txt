                   File 1 of 12 : Phrack XVII Introduction

     It's been a long time, but we're back.  After two successful releases
under the new editorship, Taran King told us that with his vacation from
school, he'd be able to put Phrack Seventeen together.  His plans soon
changed, and Seventeen was now our responsibility again.  Procrastination set
in, and some difficulty was encountered in compiling the files, but we finally
did it and here it is.

     There's a lot of good material in this issue, and we're lucky enough to
have PWN contributions from several sources, making it a true group effort.
Since The Mad Chemist and Sir Francis Drake, as well as myself, are moving on
to other things, the editorship of Phrack Inc. may be changing with the
release of Phrack Eighteen.  Regardless of what direction the publication
takes, I know that I will have no part in the creation of the next issue, so
I'd like to mention at this time that my involvement with the magazine, first
as a contributor and later as a contributing editor, has been fun.  Phrack
will go on, I'm sure, for another seventeen issues at least, and will continue
to be a primary monument to the vitality of the hacker culture.

           As  a  result of an antitrust action entered against American
      Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) by the Department of Justice,
      AT&T agreed in Jan 1982 to break up its holdings. In Aug 1982, the U. S.
      District Court-District of Columbia, entered a consent decree requiring
      AT&T to divest itself of portions of its operations.
           The  operations affected consisted of exchange telecommunications,
      exchange access functions, printed directory services and cellular radio
      telecommunications services. AT&T retained ownership of AT&T
      Communications Inc, AT&T Technologies Inc, Bell Telephone Laboratories
      Incorporated, AT&T Information Systems Inc, AT&T International Inc and
      those portions of the 22 Bell System Telephone Company subsidiaries
      which manufactured new customer premises equipment. The consent decree,
      with modifications, was agreed to by AT&T and the U. S. Department of
      Justice and approved by the U. S. Supreme Court in Feb 1983. In Dec
      1982, AT&T filed a plan of reorganization, outlining the means of
      compliance with the divestiture order. The plan was approved by the
      court in Aug 1983
           The divestiture completed on Jan 1 1984, was accomplished by the
      reorganization of the 22 principal AT&T Bell System Telephone Company
      subsidiaries under 7 new regional holding companies. Each AT&T common
      shareowner of record as of Dec 10 1983 received 1 share of common stock
      in each of the newly formed corporations for every 10 common shares of
      AT&T. AT&T common shareowners retained their AT&T stock ownership.

      retains ownership of the former A T & T long lines interstate
      organization, as well as those portions of the subsidiaries that provide
      interchange services and customer premises equipment. To accomplish the
      divestiture, this regional holding company was formed, which took over
      the applicable operations and assets of the Pacific Telephone &
      Telegraph Company and its subsidiary, Bell Telephone Company of Nevada.
      Stock in the subject was distributed to the shareholders of A T & T, who

                 File 4 of 12 : Nitrogen-Trioxide Explosives


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working notes on Nitrogen Tri-Iodide (NI-3)

By: Signal Sustain



INTRODUCTION

This particular explosive is a real loser.  It is incredibly unstable,
dangerous to make, dangerous to work with, and you can't do much with it,
either.  A string of Black Cats is worth far more.  At least you can blow up
anthills with those.

NI-3 is basically a compound you can make easily by mixing up iodine crystals
and ammonia.  The resulting precipitate is very powerful and very unstable.
It is semi stable when wet (nothing you want to trust) and absolutely unstable
when dry.  When dry, anything will set it off, such as vibration, wind, sun, a
fly landing on it.  It has to be one of the most unstable explosives you can
deal with.

But it's easy to make.  Anyone can walk into a chem supply house, and get a
bottle of iodine, and and a supermarket, and get clear ammonia.  Mix them and
you're there.  (See below for more on this)

So, some of you are going to try it, so I might as well pass on some tips from
hard experience.  (I learned it was a loser by trying it).


Use Small Batches


First, make one very small batch first.  Once you learn how powerful this
stuff is, you'll see why.  If you're mixing iodine crystals (that's right,
crystals, iodine is a metal, a halogen, and its solid form is crystals; the
junk they sell as "iodine" in the grocery store is about 3% iodine in a bunch
of solvents, and doesn't work for this application), you want maybe 1/4
teaspoonful MAX, even less maybe.  1/4 TSP of this stuff is one hellacious
bang; it rattled the windows for a block around when it went off in my back
yard.

So go with 1/4 TSP, if I can talk you into it.  The reason is the instability
of this compound.  If you mix up two teaspoonfuls and it goes off in your
hand, kiss your hand goodbye right down to the wrist.  A bucketful would
probably level any house you'll find.  But 1/4 teaspoon, you might keep your
fingers.  Since I know you're not going to mix this stuff up with remote
tools, keep the quantities small.  This stuff is so unstable it's best to
hedge your bets.

Note:  When holding NI3, try to hold with remote tools -- forceps?  But if you
have to pick it up, fold your thumb next to your first finger, and grip around
with your fingers only.  Do not grip the flask the conventional way, fingers
on one side, thumb of the other.  This way, if it goes, you may still have an
opposing thumb, which is enough to get by with.

The compound is far more stable when wet, but not certain-stable.  That's why
companies that make explosives won't use it; even a small chance of it blowing
up is too dangerous.  (They still lose dynamite plants every now and then,
too, which is why they're fully automated).  But when this stuff gets dry,
look out.  Heinlein says "A harsh look will set it off", and he isn't kidding.
Wind, vibration, a breath across it, anything will trigger it off.  (By the
way, Heinlein's process, from  SF book "Farnham's Freehold", doesn't work,
either -- you can't use iodine liquid for this.  You must use iodine
crystals.)

Don't Store It

What's so wickedly dangerous is if you try to store the stuff.  Say you put it
in a cup.  After a day, a crust forms around the rim of the liquid, and it
dries out.  You pick up the cup, kabang!, the crust goes off, and the liquid
goes up from the shock.  Your fingers sail into your neighbor's lawn.  If you
make this, take extreme pains to keep it all wet.  At least stopper the
testtube, so it can't evaporate.


Making It

Still want to make it?  Okay.  Get some iodine crystals at a chem supply
store.  If they ask, say you need to purify water for a camping trip, and
they'll lecture you on better alternatives (halazone) but you can still get
it.  Or, tell them you've been elected to play Mr. Wizard, and be honest --
you'll probably get it too.  Possession is not illegal.

Get as little as possible.  You need little and it's useless once you've tried
it once.  Aim for 1/4 teaspoonful.

Second, get some CLEAR, NON SUDSY ammonia at the store, like for cleaning
purposes (BUT NO SUDS!  They screw things up, it doesn't make the NI-3).

Third, pour ammonia in a bowl.  Peeew!  Nice smell.

Fourth, add 1/4 TSP or less of iodine crystals.  Note these crystals, which
looks like instant coffee, will attack other metals, so look out for your
tableware.  Use plastic everything (Bowl, spoon) if you can.  These crystals
will also leave long-standing iodine stains on hands, and that's damned
incriminating if there was just an NI-3 explosion and they're looking for who
did it.  Rubber gloves, please, dispose after use.

Now the crystals will sort of spread out.  Stir a little if need be.  Be
damned careful not to leave solution on the spoon that might dry.  It'll go
off if you do, believe me.  (Experience).

Let them spread out and fizzz.  They will.  Then after an hour or so there
will be left some reddish-brown glop in the bottom of the clear ammonia.  It's
sticky like mud, hard to handle..  That's the NI-3.

It is safe right now, as it is wet.  (DO NOT LET A RIM FORM ON THE AMMONIA
LIQUID!)



Using It

Now let's use up this junk right away and DON'T try to store it.

Go put it outside someplace safe.  In my high school, someone once sprinkled
tiny, tiny bits (like individual crystals) in a hallway.  Works good, it's
like setting off a cap under someone's shoe after the stuff dries.  You need
far less than 1/4 TSP for this, too.

Spread it out in the sun, let it dry.  DO NOT DISTURB.  If you hear a sudden
CRACK!, why, it means the wind just blew enough to set it off, or maybe it
just went off by itself.  It does that too.

It must be thoroughly dry to reach max instability where a harsh look sets it
off.  Of course the top crystals dry first, so heads up.  Any sharp impact
will set it off, wet or dry.

While you're waiting for it to dry, go BURN the plastic cup and spoon you made
it with.  You'll hear small snapping noises as you do; this is the solution
drying and going off in the flames.

After two hours or so, toss rocks at the NI3 from a long ways away, and you'll
see it go off.  Purplish fumes follow each explosion.  It's a sharp CRACK, you
can't miss it.

Anyway.  Like I say, most people make this because the ingredients are so
easily available.  They make it, say what the hell do I do now?, and sprinkle
tiny crystals in the hallway.  Bang bang bang.  And they never make it again,
because you only get one set of fingers per hand, and most people want to keep
them.

Or they put it in door locks (while still in the "sludge" form), and wait for
it to try.  Next person who sticks a key in there has a big surprise.

(This is also why most high school chem teachers lock up the iodine crystals.)

Getting Rid Of It

If you wash the NI-3 crystals down your kitchen sink, then you have to only
wait for them to dry out and go off.  They'll stick to the pipe (halogen
property, there).  I heard a set of pipes pop and crackle for days after this
was done.  I'd recommend going and throwing the mess into a vacant lots or
something, and trying to set it off so no one else does accidentally.

If you do this, good luck, and you've been warned.

                   File 5 of 12 : How to Hack Cyber Systems



How To Hack A CDC Cyber

By: ** Grey Sorcerer


Index:

1. General Hacking Tips
2. Fun with the card punch
3. Getting a new user number the easy way
4. Hacking with Telex and the CDC's batch design
5. Grabbing a copy of the whole System
6. Staying Rolled In with BREAK
7. Macro Library
8. RJE Status Checks
9. The Worm
10. The Checkpoint/Restart Method to a Better Validation


I'm going to go ahead and skip all the stuff that's in your CDC reference
manuals.. what's a local file and all that.  If you're at the point of being
ready to hack the system, you know all that; if not, you'll have to get up to
speed on it before a lot of this will make sense.  Seems to me too many "how
to hack" files are just short rewrites of the user manuals (which you should
get for any serious penetration attempt anyway, or you'll miss lots of
possibilities), without any tips on ways to hack the system.


General hacking tips:


Don't get caught.  Use remote dialups if possible and never never use any user
number you could be associated with.  Also never re-use a user number.
Remember your typical Cyber site has a zillion user numbers, and they can't
watch every one.  Hide in numbers.  And anytime things get "hot", lay off for
awhile.

Magtapes are great.  They hold about 60 Meg, a pile of data, and can hold even
more with the new drives.  You can hide a lot of stuff here offline, like
dumps of the system, etc., to peruse.  Buy a few top quality ones..  I like
Black Watch tapes my site sells to me the most, and put some innocuous crap on
the first few records..  data or a class program or whatever, then get to the
good stuff.  That way you'll pass a cursory check.  Remember a usual site has
THOUSANDS of tapes and cannot possibly be scanning every one; they haven't
time.

One thing about the Cybers -- they keep this audit trail called a "port log"
on all PPU and CPU accesses.  Normally, it's not looked at.  But just remember
that *everything* you do is being recorded if someone has the brains and the
determination (which ultimately is from you) to look for it.  So don't do
something stupid like doing real work on your user number, log off, log right
onto another, and dump the system.  They WILL know.

Leave No Tracks.

Also remember the first rule of bragging:  Your Friends Turn You In.

And the second rule:  If everyone learns the trick to increasing priority,
you'll all be back on the same level again, won't you?  And if you show just
two friends, count on this:  they'll both show two friends, who will show
four...

So enjoy the joke yourself and keep it that way.


Fun With The Card Punch


Yes, incredibly, CDC sites still use punch cards.  This is well in keeping
with CDC's overall approach to life ("It's the 1960's").

The first thing to do is empty the card punch's punchbin of all the little
punchlets, and throw them in someone's hair some rowdy night.  I guarantee the
little suckers will stay in their hair for six months, they are impossible to
get out.  Static or something makes them cling like lice.  Showers don't even
work.

The next thing to do is watch how your local installation handles punch card
decks.  Generally it works like this.  The operators love punchcard jobs
because they can give them ultra-low priority, and make the poor saps who use
them wait while the ops run their poster-maker or Star Trek job at high
priority.  So usually you feed in your punchcard deck, go to the printout
room, and a year later, out comes your printout.

Also, a lot of people generally get their decks fed in at once at the card
reader.

If you can, punch a card that's completely spaghetti -- all holes punched.
This has also been known to crash the cardreader PPU and down the system.  Ha,
ha.  It is also almost certain to jam the reader.  If you want to watch an
operator on his back trying to pick pieces of card out of the reader with
tweezers, here's your chance.

Next, the structure of a card deck job gives lots of possibilities for fun.
Generally it looks like this:

  JOB card:  the job name (first 4 characters)
  User Card:  Some user number and  password -- varies with site
EOR card: 7-8-9 are punched
  Your Batch job (typically, Compile This Fortran Program).  You know, FTN.
  LGO.  (means, run the Compiled Program)
EOR card: 7-8-9 are punched
  The Fortran program source code
EOR card: 7-8-9 are punched
  The Data for your Fortran program
EOF card: 6-7-8-9 are punched.  This indicates:  (end of deck)

This is extremely typical for your beginning Fortran class.

In a usual mainframe site, the punchdecks accumulate in a bin at the operator
desk.  Then, whenever he gets to it, the card reader operator takes about
fifty punchdecks, gathers them all together end to end, and runs them through.
Then he puts them back in the bin and goes back to his Penthouse.


GETTING A NEW USER NUMBER THE EASY WAY


Try this for laughs:  make your Batch job into:

  JOB card:  the job name (first 4 characters)
  User Card:  Some user number and  password -- varies with site
  EOR card:  7-8-9 are punched
  COPYEI INPUT,filename:  This copies everything following the EOR mark to the
                          filename in this account.
  EOR Card:  7-8-9 are punched.

Then DO NOT put an EOF card at the end of your job.

Big surprise for the job following yours:  his entire punch deck, with, of
course, his user number and password, will be copied to your account.  This is
because the last card in YOUR deck is the end-of-record, which indicates the
program's data is coming next, and that's the next person's punch deck, all
the way up to -his- EOF card.  The COPYEI will make sure to skip those pesky
record marks, too.

I think you can imagine the rest, it ain't hard.


Hacking With Telex

When CDC added timeshare to the punch-card batch-job designed Cyber machines,
they made two types of access to the system:  Batch and Telex.  Batch is a
punch-card deck, typically, and is run whenever the operator feels like it.
Inside the system, it is given ultra low priority and is squeezed in whenever.
It's a "batch" of things to do, with a start and end.

Telex is another matter.  It's the timeshare system, and supports up to, oh,
60 terminals.  Depends on the system; the more RAM, the more swapping area (if
you're lucky enough to have that), the more terminals can be supported before
the whole system becomes slug-like.

Telex is handled as a weird "batch" file where the system doesn't know how
much it'll have to do, or where it'll end, but executes commands as you type
them in.  A real kludge.

Because the people running on a CRT expect some sort of response, they're
given higher priority.  This leads to "Telex thrashing" on heavily loaded CDC
systems; only the Telex users get anywhere, and they sit and fight over the
machine's resources.

The poor dorks with the punch card decks never get into the machine, because
all the Telex users are getting the priority and the CPU.  (So DON'T use punch
cards.)

Another good tip:  if you are REQUIRED to use punch cards, then go type in
your program on a CRT, and drop it to the automatic punch.  Sure saves trying
to correct those typos on cards..

When you're running under Telex, you're part of one of several "jobs" inside
the system.  Generally there's "TELEX," something to run the line printer,
something to run the card reader, the mag tape drivers (named "MAGNET") and
maybe a few others floating around.  There's limited space inside a Cyber..
would you believe 128K 60-bit words?..  so there's a limited number of jobs
that can fit.  CDC put all their effort into "job scheduling" to make the best
of what they had.

You can issue a status command to see all jobs running; it's educational.

Anyway, the CDC machines were originally designed to run card jobs with lots
of magtape access.  You know, like IRS stuff.  So they never thought a job
could "interrupt," like pressing BREAK on a CRT, because card jobs can't.
This gives great possibilities.

Like:

Grabbing a Copy Of The System

For instance.  Go into BATCH mode from Telex,  and do a Fortran compile.
While in that, press BREAK.  You'll get a "Continue?" verification prompt.
Say no, you'd like to stop.

Now go list your local files.  Whups, there's a new BIG one there.  In fact,
it's a copy of the ENTIRE system you're running on -- PPU code, CPU code, ALL
compilers, the whole shebang!  Go examine this local file; you'll see the
whole bloody works there, mate, ready to play with.

Of course, you're set up to drop this to tape or disk at your leisure, right?

This works because the people at CDC never thought that a Fortran compile
could be interrupted, because they always thought it would be running off
cards.  So they left the System local to the job until the compile was done.
Interrupt the compile, it stays local.

Warning:  When you do ANYTHING a copy of your current batch process shows up
on the operator console.  Typically the operators are reading Penthouse and
don't care, and anyway the display flickers by so fast it's hard to see.  But
if you copy the whole system, it takes awhile, and they get a blow-by-blow
description of what's being copied.  ("Hey, why is this %^&$^ on terminal 29
copying the PPU code?") I got nailed once this way; I played dumb and they let
me go.  ("I thought it was a data file from my program").


Staying "Rolled In"

When the people at CDC designed the job scheduler, they made several "queues."
"Queues" are lines.

There's:

1. Input Queue.  Your job hasn't even gotten in yet.  It is standing outside,
                 on disk, waiting.
2. Executing Queue.  Your job is currently memory resident and is being
                 executed, although other jobs currently in memory are
                 competing for the machine as well.  At least you're in
                 memory.
3. Timed/Event Rollout Queue:  Your job is waiting for something, usually a
                 magtape.  Can also be waiting for a given time.  Yes, this
                 means you can put a delayed effect job into the system.  Ha,
                 ha.  You are on disk at this point.
4. Rollout Queue:  Your job is waiting its turn to execute.  You're out on
                 disk right now doing nothing.

Anyway, let's say you've got a big Pascal compile.  First, ALWAYS RUN FROM
TELEX (means, off a CRT).  Never use cards.  If you use cards you're
automatically going to be low man on the priority schedule, because the CPU
doesn't *have* to get back to you soon.  Who of us has time to waste?

Okay, do the compile.  Then do a STATUS on your job from another machine.
Typically you'll be left inside the CPU (EXECUTE) for 10 seconds, where you'll
share the actual CPU with about 10-16 other jobs.  Then you'll be rolled-out
(ROLLOUT), at which time you're phucked; you have to wait for your priority to
climb back up before it'll execute some more of your job.  This can take
several minutes on a deeply loaded system.

(All jobs have a given priority level, which usually increments every 10 sec
or so, until they start executing).

Okay, do this.  Press BREAK, then at the "Continue?" prompt, say yes.  What
happened?  Telex had to "roll your job in" to process the BREAK!  So you get
another free 10 seconds of CPU -- which can get a lot done.

If you sit and hit BREAK - Y <return> every 10 sec or so during a really big
job, you will just fly through it.  Of course, everyone else will be sitting
and staring at their screen, doing nothing, because you've got the computer.

If you're at a school with a Cyber, this is how to get your homework done at
high speed.


Macro Library

If you have a typical CDC site, they won't give you access to the "Macro
library."  This is a set of CPU calls to do various things -- open files, do
directory commands, and whatnot.  They will be too terrified of "some hacker."
Reality:  The dimbulbs in power don't want to give up ANY of their power to
ANYONE.  You can't really do that much more with the Macro library, which
gives assembly language access to the computer, than you can with batch
commands..  except what you do leaves lots less tracks.  They REALLY have to
dig to find out what your program did if you use Macro calls..  they have to
go to PPU port logs, which is needle in a haystack sort of stuff, vs. batch
file logs, which are real obvious.

Worry not.  Find someone at Arizona State or Minnesota U. that's cool, and get
them to send you a tape of the libraries.  You'll get all the code you can
stand to look at.  By the way they have a great poster tape...  just copy the
posters to the line printer.  Takes a long time to print them but it's worth
it.  (They have all the classic ones..  man on the moon, various playmates,
Spock, etc.  Some are 7 frames wide!).

With the Macro library, you can do many cool things.

The best is a demon scanner.  All CDC user numbers have controlled access for
other users to individual files -- either private, (no access to anyone else),
semiprivate (others can read it but a record is made), or public (anyone can
diddle your files, no record).  What you want is a program (fairly easy to do
in Fortran) that counts through user numbers, doing directory commands.  If it
finds anything, it checks for non semi-private (so no records are made), then
copies it to you.

You'll find the damnedest stuff, I guarantee it.  Try to watch some system
type signing in and get the digits of his user number, then scan variations
beginning with that user #.  For instance, if he's a SYS1234, then scan all
user #'s beginning with SYS (sysaaaa to sys9999).

Since it's all inside the Fortran program, the only record, other than
hard-to-examine PPU logs, is a "Run Fortran Program" ("LGO.") on the batch
dayfile.  If you're not giving the overworked system people reason to suspect
that commonplace, every-day student Fortran compile is anything out of the
ordinary, they will never bother to check -- the amount of data in PPU logs is
OVERWHELMING.

But you can get great stuff.

There's a whole cool library of Fortran-callable routines to do damned near
anything a batch command could do in the Minnesota library.  Time to get some
Minnesota friends -- like on UseNet.  They're real cooperative about sending
out tapes, etc.

Generally you'll find old files that some System Type  made public one day (so
a buddy could copy them) then forgot about.  I picked off all sorts of stuff
like this.  What's great is I just claimed my Fortran programs were hanging
into infinite loops -- this explained the multi-second CPU execution times.
Since there wasn't any readily available record of what I was up to, they
believed it.  Besides, how many idiot users really DO hang into loops?  Lots.
Hide in numbers.  I got Chess 4.2 this way -- a championship Chess program --
and lots of other stuff.  The whole games library, for instance, which was
blocked from access to mere users but not to sysfolk.

Again, they *can* track this down if you make yourself obnoxious (it's going
to be pretty obvious what you're doing if there's a CAT: SYSAAAA
CAT: SYSAAAB  CAT: SYSAAAC .. etc. on your PPU port log) so do this on someone
else's user number.


RJE Status Checks

Lots of stupid CDC installations..  well, that doesn't narrow the field much..
have Remote Job Entry stations.  Generally at universities they let some poor
student run these at low pay.

What's funny is these RJE's can do a status on the jobs in the system, and the
system screeches to a halt while the status is performed.  It gets top
priority.

So, if you want to incite a little rebellion, just sit at your RJE and do
status requests over and over.  The system will be even slower than usual.


The Worm

Warning:  This is pretty drastic.  It goes past mere self-defense in getting
enough priority to get your homework done, or a little harmless exploration
inside your system, to trying to drop the whole shebang.

It works, too.


You can submit batch jobs to the system, just as if you'd run them through the
punchcard reader, using the SUBMIT command.  You set up a data file, then do
SUBMIT datafile.  It runs separate from you.

Now, let's say we set up a datafile named WORM.  It's a batch file.  It looks
like this:

JOB
USER,blah (whatever -- a user number you want crucified)
GET,WORM; get a copy of WORM
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
SUBMIT,WORM.; send it to system
  (16 times)
(end of file)

Now, you SUBMIT WORM.  What happens?  Worm makes 16 copies of itself and
submits those.  Those in turn make 16 copies of themselves (now we're up to
256) and submit those.  Next pass is 4096.  Then 65536.  Then...

Now, if you're really good, you'll put on your "job card" a request for high
priority.  How?  Tell the system you need very little memory and very little
CPU time (which is true, Submit takes almost nothing at all).  The scheduler
"squeezes" in little jobs between all the big ones everyone loves to run, and
gives ultra-priority to really tiny jobs.

What happens is the system submits itself to death.  Sooner or later the input
queue overflows .. there's only so much space .. and the system falls apart.

This is a particularly gruesome thing to do to a system, because if the guy
at the console (count on it) tries the usual startup, there will still be
copies of WORM in the input queue.  First one of those gets loose, the system
drops again.  With any luck the system will go up and down for several hours
before someone with several connected brain cells arrives at the operator
console and coldstarts the system.

If you've got a whole room full of computer twits, all with their hair tied
behind them with a rubber band into a ponytail, busily running their Pascal
and "C" compiles, you're in for a good time.  One second they will all be
printing -- the printers will be going weep-weep across the paper.  Next
second, after you run, they will stop.  And they will stay stopped.  If you've
done it right they can't get even get a status.  Ha, ha.

The faster the CPU, the faster it will run itself into the ground.

CDC claims there is a limit on the number of jobs a user number can have in
the system.  As usual they blew it and this limit doesn't exist.  Anyway, it's
the input queue overflow that kills things, and you can get to the input queue
without the # of jobs validation check.

Bear in mind that *anything* in that batch file is going to get repeated ten
zillion times at the operator console as the little jobs fly by by the
thousands.  So be sure to include some charming messages, like:

job,blah
user,blah
* eat me!
get,worm
submit,worm .. etc.

There will now be thousands of little "eat me!"'s scrolling across the console
as fast as the console PPU can print them.

Generally at this point the operator will have his blood pressure really
spraying out his ears.

Rest assured they will move heaven and earth to find you.  This includes past
dayfiles, user logs, etc.  So be clean.  Remember, "Revenge is a dish best
served cold."  If you're mad at them, and they know it, wait a year or so,
until they are scratching their heads, wondering who hates them this much.

Also:  make sure you don't take down a really important job someone else is
doing, okay?  Like, no medical databases, and so forth.

Now, for a really deft touch, submit a timed/event job.  This "blocks" the job
for awhile, until a given time is reached.  Then, when you're far, far away,
with a great alibi, the job restarts, the system falls apart, and you're
clear.  If you do the timed/event rollout with a Fortran program macro call,
it won't even show up on the log.

(Remember that the System Folk will eventually realize, in their little minds,
what you've done.  It may take them a year or two though).


CHECKPOINT / RESTART

I've saved the best for last.

CDC's programmers supplied two utilities, called CheckPoint and Restart,
primarily because their computers kept crashing before they would finish
anything.  What Checkpoint does is make a COMPLETE copy of what you're doing -
all local files, all of memory, etc. -- into a file, usually on a magtape.
Then Restart "restarts" from that point.

So, when you're running a 12 hour computer job, you sprinkle checkpoints
throughout, and if the CDC drops, you can restart from your last CKP.  It's
like a tape backup of a hard disk.  This way, you only lose the work done on
your data between the last checkpoint and now, rather than the whole 12 hours.
Look, this is real important on jobs that take days -- check out your local
IRS for details..

Now what's damned funny is if you look closely at the file Checkpoint
generates, you will find a copy of your user validations, which tell
everything about you to the system, along with the user files, memory, etc.
You'll have to do a little digging in hex to find the numbers, but they'll
match up nicely with the display you of your user validations from that batch
command.

Now, let's say you CKP,that makes the CKP file.  Then run a little FORTRAN
program to edit the validations that are inside that CKP-generated file.  Then
you RESTART from it.  Congratulations.  You're a self made man.  You can do
whatever you want to do - set your priority level to top, grab the line
printer as your personal printer, kick other jobs off the system (it's more
subtle to set their priority to zilch so they never execute), etc. etc.
You're the operator.

This is really the time to be a CDC whiz and know all sorts of dark, devious
things to do.  I'd have a list of user numbers handy that have files you'd
like made public access, so you can go in and superzap them (then peruse them
later from other signons), and so forth.

There's some gotchas in here.. for instance, CKP must be run as part of a
batch file out of Telex.  But you can work around them now that you know the
people at CDC made RESTART alter your user validations.

It makes sense in a way.  If you're trying to restart a job you need the same
priority, memory, and access you had when trying to run it before.

Conclusion


There you have it, the secrets of hacking the Cyber.

They've come out of several years at a college with one CDC machine, which I
will identify as being somewhere East.  They worked when I left; while CDC may
have patched some of them, I doubt it.  They're not real fast on updates to
their operating system.

                     File 6 of 12 : How to Hack HP2000's



How to Hack an HP 2000

By: ** Grey Sorcerer

Okay, so you've read the HP-2000 basic guides, and know your way around.  I
will not repeat all that.

There's two or three things I've found that allow you through HP 2000
security.

1. When you log in, a file called HELLO on the user number Z999 is run.  A lot
of time this file is used to deny you access.  Want in?  Well, it's just a
BASIC program, and an be BREAKed.. but, usually the first thing they do in
that program is turn Breaks (interrupts) off by the BRK(0) function.  However,
if you log in like this:

HELLO-D345,PASS (return) (break)

With the break nearly instantly after the return, a lot of time, you'll abort
the HELLO program, and be home free.

2. If you can create a "bad file", which takes some doing, then anytime you
try to CSAVE this file (compile and save), the system will quickly fade into a
hard crash.

3. How to make a bad file and other goodies:

The most deadly hole in security in the HP2000 is the "two terminal" method.
You've got to understand buffers to see how it works.  When you OPEN a file,
or ASSIGN it (same thing), you get 256 bytes of the file -- the first 256.
When you need anymore, you get 256 more.  They are brought in off the disk in
discrete chunks.  They are stored in "buffers."

So.  Save a bunch of junk to disk -- programs, data, whatever.  Then once your
user number is full, delete all of it.  The effect is to leave the raw jumbled
data on disk.


Pick a time when the system is REAL busy, then:

1. Have terminal #1 running a program that looks for a file to exist (with the
ASSIGN) statement as quickly as it can loop.  If it finds the file there, it
goes to the very end of the file, and starts reading backwards, record by
record, looking for data.  If it finds data, it lets you know, and stops at an
input prompt.  It is now running.

2. Have terminal #2 create a really huge data file (OPEN-FILE, 3000) or
however it goes.

What happens is terminal #2's command starts zeroing all the sectors of the
file, starting at file start.  But it only gets so far before someone else
needs the processor, and kicks #2 out.  The zeroing stops for a sec.  Terminal
#1 gets in, finds the file there, and reads to the end.  What's there?  Old
trash on disk.  (Which can be mighty damned interesting by the way -- did you
know HP uses a discrete mark to indicate end-of-buffer?  You've just maybe got
yourself a buffer that is as deep as system memory, and if you're clever, you
can peek or poke anywhere in memory.  If so, keep it, it is pure gold).

But.  Back to the action.

3. Terminal #2 completes the OPEN.  He now deletes the file.  This leaves
Terminal #1 with a buffer full of data waiting to be dumped back to disk at
that file's old disk location.

4. Terminal #2 now saves a load of program files, as many as are required to
fill up the area that was taken up by the deleted big file.

5. You let Terminal #1 past the input prompt, and it writes its buffer to
disk.  This promptly overlays some program just stored there.  Result:  "bad
program."  HPs are designed with a syntax checker and store programs in token;
a "bad program" is one that the tokens are screwed up in.  Since HP assumes
that if a program is THERE, it passed the syntax check, it must be okay...
it's in for big problems.  For a quick thrill, just CSAVE it..  system tries
to semi-compile bad code, and drops.

Really, the classier thing to do with this is to use the "bottomless buffer"
to look through your system and change what you don't like.. maybe the
password to A000?  Write some HP code, look around memory, have a good time.
It can be done.

 Comment:  I came across this article in Computer Shopper (Sept. 1987)  and it
   talked about citizens access government computers since we do pay  for them
   with our  taxpayers monies.  Since then, I have had  friends and gone  on a
   few myself  and the  databases are full of  information for accessing.  One
   thing, you usually have to call the sysop for access and give him your real
   name, address  and the like.  They call you back and verify your existence.
   Just a word of  warning; crashing a BBS is a crime, so I wouldn't fool with
   these since they are government based.

                            ** ARTICLE FOLLOWS **

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        An increasingly popular technique for protecting dial-in ports from
the ravages of hackers and other more sinister system penetrators is dial back
operation wherein a legitimate user initiates a call to the system he desires
to connect with, types in his user ID and perhaps a password, disconnects and
waits for the system to call him back at a prearranged number. It is assumed
that a penetrator will not be able to specify the dial back number (which is
carefully protected), and so even if he is able to guess a user-name/password
pair he cannot penetrate the system because he cannot do anything meaningful
except type in a user-name and password when he is connected to the system. If
he has a correct pair it is assumed the worst that could happen is a spurious
call to some legitimate user which will do no harm and might even result in a
security investigation.

        Many installations depend on dial-back operation of modems for their
principle protection against penetration via their dial up ports on the
incorrect presumption that there is no way a penetrator could get connected to
the modem on the call back call unless he was able to tap directly into the
line being called back.  Alas, this assumption is not always true -
compromises in the design of modems and the telephone network unfortunately
make it all too possible for a clever penetrator to get connected to the call
back call and fool the modem into thinking that it had in fact dialed the
legitimate user.

        The problem areas are as follows:

                        Caller control central offices

        Many older telephone central office switches implement caller control
in which the release of the connection from a calling telephone to a called
telephone is exclusively controlled by the originating telephone.  This means
that if the penetrator simply failed to hang up a call to a modem on such a
central office after he typed the legitimate user's user-name and password,
the modem would be unable to hang up the connection.

        Almost all modems would simply go on-hook in this situation and not
notice that the connection had not been broken.  If the same line was used to
dial out on as the call came in on,  when the modem went to dial out to call
the legitimate user back the it might not notice (there is no standard way of
doing so electrically) that the penetrator was still connected on the line.
This means that the modem might attempt to dial and then wait for an
answerback tone from the far end modem. If the penetrator was kind enough to
supply the answerback tone from his modem after he heard the system modem
dial, he could make a connection and penetrate the system. Of course some
modems incorporate dial tone detectors and ringback detectors and in fact wait
for dial tone before dialing, and ringback after dialing but fooling those
with a recording of dial tone (or a dial tone generator chip) should pose
little problem.


                     Trying to call out on a ringing line

        Some modems are dumb enough to pick up a ringing line and attempt to
make a call out on it.   This fact could be used by a system penetrator to
break dial back security even on joint control or called party control central
offices.  A penetrator would merely have to dial in on the dial-out line
(which would work even if it was a separate line as long as the penetrator was
able to obtain it's number), just as the modem was about to dial out.  The
same technique of waiting for dialing to complete and then supplying
answerback tone could be used - and of course the same technique of supplying
dial tone to a modem which waited for it would work here too.

        Calling the dial-out line would work especially well in cases where
the software controlling the modem either disabled auto-answer during the
period between dial-in and dial-back (and thus allowed the line to ring with
no action being taken) or allowed the modem to answer the line (auto-answer
enabled) and paid no attention to whether the line was already connected when
it tried to dial out on it.


                               The ring window

        However, even carefully written software can be fooled by the ring
window problem.  Many central offices actually will connect an incoming call
to a line if the line goes off hook just as the call comes in without first
having put the 20 hz. ringing voltage on the line to make it ring.  The ring
voltage in many telephone central offices is supplied asynchronously every 6
seconds to every line on which there is an incoming call that has not been
answered, so if an incoming call reaches a line just an instant after the end
of the ring period and the line clairvoyantly responds by going off hook it
may never see any ring voltage.

        This means that a modem that picks up the line to dial out just as our
penetrator dials in may not see any ring voltage and may therefore have no way
of knowing that it is connected to an incoming call rather than the call
originating circuitry of the switch.  And even if the switch always rings
before connecting an incoming call, most modems have a window just as they are
going off hook to originate a call when they will ignore transients (such as
ringing voltage) on the assumption that they originate from the going-off-hook
process. [The author is aware that some central offices reverse battery (the
polarity of the voltage on the line) in the answer condition to distinguish it
from the originate condition, but as this is by no means universal few if any
modems take advantage of the information supplied]


                                  In Summary

        It is thus impossible to say with any certainty that when a modem goes
off hook and tries to dial out on a line which can accept incoming calls it
really is connected to the switch and actually making an outgoing call. And
because it is relatively easy for a system penetrator to fool the tone
detecting circuitry in a modem into believing that it is seeing dial tone,
ringback and so forth until he supplies answerback tone and connects and
penetrates system security should not depend on this sort of dial-back.


                             Some Recommendations

        Dial back using the same line used to dial in is not very secure and
cannot be made completely secure with conventional modems.  Use of dithered
(random) time delays between dial in and dial back combined with allowing the
modem to answer during the wait period (with provisions made for recognizing
the fact that this wasn't the originated call - perhaps by checking to see if
the modem is in originate or answer mode) will substantially reduce this
window of vulnerability but nothing can completely eliminate it.

        Obviously if one happens to be connected to an older caller control
switch, using the same line for dial in and dial out isn't secure at all.  It
is easy to experimentally determine this, so it ought to be possible to avoid
such situations.

        Dial back using a separate line (or line and modem) for dialing out is
much better, provided that either the dial out line is sterile (not readily
traceable by a penetrator to the target system) or that it is a one way line
that cannot accept incoming calls at all.  Unfortunately the later technique
is far superior to the former in most organizations as concealing the
telephone number of dial out lines for long periods involves considerable
risk.  The author has not tried to order a dial out only telephone line, so he
is unaware of what special charges might be made for this service or even if
it is available.

                           A final word of warning

        In years past it was possible to access telephone company test and
verification trunks in some areas of the country by using mf tones from so
called "blue boxes". These test trunks connect to special ports on telephone
switches that allow a test connection to be made to a line that doesn't
disconnect when the line hangs up.   These test connections could be used to
fool a dial out modem, even one on a dial out only line (since the telephone
company needs a way to test it, they usually supply test connections to it
even if the customer can't receive calls).

        Access to verification and test ports and trunks has been tightened
(they are a kind of dial-a-wiretap so it ought to be pretty difficult) but in
any as in any system there is always the danger that someone, through
stupidity or ignorance if not mendacity will allow a system penetrator access
to one.

                       **  Some more recent comments **

        Since posting this I have had several people suggest use of PBX lines
that can dial out but not be dialed into or outward WATS lines that also
cannot be dialed.  Several people have also suggested use of call forwarding
to forward incoming calls on the dial out line to the security office. [This
may not work too well in areas served by certain ESS's which ring the number
from which calls are being forwarded once anyway in case someone forgot to
cancel forwarding. Forwarding is also subject to being cancelled at random
times by central office software reboots]

        And since posting this I actually tried making some measurements of
how wide the incoming call window is for the modems we use for dial in at
CRDS.  It appears to be at least 2-3 seconds for US Robotics Courier 2400 baud
modems.  I found I could defeat same-line-for-dial-out dialback quite handily
in a few dozen tries no matter what tricks I played with timing and watching
modem status in the dial back login software. I eventually concluded that
short of reprogramming the micro in the modem to be smarter about monitoring
line state, there was little I could do at the login (getty) level to provide
much security for same line dialback.

        Since it usually took a few tries to break in, it is possible to
provide some slight security improvement by sharply limiting the number of
unsuccessful callbacks per user per day so that a hacker with only a couple of
passwords would have to try over a significant period of time.

        Note that dialback on a dedicated dial-out only line is somewhat
secure.

 TAPPING COMPUTER DATA IS EASY, AND CLEARER THAN PHONE CALLS !

    BY RIC BLACKMON, SYSOP OF A FED BBS

        Aquired by Elric of Imrryr & Lunatic Labs UnLtd

Note from Elric:  This file was written by the sysop of a board for computer
security people (run on a CoCo), as far as I know the board no longer exists,
it was being crashed by hackers too much... (hehe).
---------------------

        FOR SEVERAL YEARS, I ACCEPTED CERTAIN BITS OF MISINFORMATION AS
TECHNICALLY ACCURATE, AND DIDN'T PROPERLY PURSUE THE MATTER.  SEVERAL FOOLS
GAVE ME FOOLISH INFORMATION, SUCH AS: A TAP INTERRUPTS COMPUTER DATA
TRANSMISSIONS; DATA COULD BE PICKED UP AS RF EMANATIONS BUT IT WAS A MASS OF
UNINTELLIGIBLE SIGNAL CAUSED BY DATA MOVING BETWEEN REGISTERS; ONE HAD TO BE
IN 'SYNC' WITH ANY SENDING COMPUTER; DATA COULDN'T BE READ UNLESS YOU HAD A
DIRECT MATCH IN SPEED, PARITY & BIT PATTERN; AND ONLY A COMPUTER OF THE SAME
MAKE AND MODEL COULD READ THE SENDING COMPUTER.  THIS IS ALL PLAIN SWILL.  IT
IS IN FACT, AN EASIER CHORE TO TAP A COMPUTER THAN A TELEPHONE.  THE TECHNIQUE
AND THE EQUIPMENT IS ALMOST THE SAME, BUT THE COMPUTER LINE WILL BE MORE
ACCURATE (THE TWO COMPUTERS INVOLVED, HAVE ERROR CORRECTING PROCEDURES) AND
CLEARER (DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONS HAVE MORE DISTINCT SIGNALS THAN ANALOG
TRANSMISSIONS).

FIRST, RECOGNIZE THAT NEARLY ALL DATA TRANSMISSIONS ARE SENT IN CLEARTEXT
ASCII SIGNALS.  THE LINES CARRYING OTHER BIT-GROUPS OR ENCIPHERED TEXTS ARE
RARE.  SECOND, THE SIGNAL APPEARS ON GREEN AND RED (WIRES) OF THE PHONE LINE
('TIP' AND 'RING').  THE DATA IS MOST LIKELY ASYNCHRONOUS SERIAL DATA MOVING
AT 300 BAUD.  NOW THAT 1200 BAUD IS BECOMING MORE CHIC, YOU CAN EXPECT TO FIND
A GROWING USE OF THE FASTER TRANSMISSION RATE.  FINALLY, YOU DON'T NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT THE PROTOCOL OR EVEN THE BAUD RATE (SPEED) UNTIL AFTER A TAPED
COPY OF A TRANSMISSION IS OBTAINED.

        IN A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT, A TAPED COPY OF A DATA TRANSMISSION WAS MADE
WITH THE CHEAPEST OF TAPE RECORDERS, TAPPING THE GREEN AND RED LINES BEYOND
THE MODEM.  THE RECORDING WAS THEN PLAYED INTO A MODEM AS THOUGH IT WERE AN
ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION. AT THAT POINT, HAD IT BEEN NECESSARY, THE PROTOCOL
SETTINGS ON RECEIVING TERMINAL COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO MATCH THE TAPE.  NO
ADJUSTMENTS WERE NECESSARY AND A NICE, CLEAR ERROR-FREE DOCUMENT WAS RECEIVED
ON THE ILLICIT VIDEO SCREEN AND A NEAT HARD-COPY OF THE DOCUMENT CAME OFF THE
PRINTER.  THE MESSAGE WAS INDEED CAPTURED, BUT HAD IT BEEN AN INTERCEPTION
INSTEAD OF A SIMPLE MONITORING, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ALTERED WITH A SIMPLE WORD
PROCESSOR PROGRAM, TO SUIT ANY PURPOSE, AND PLACED BACK ON THE WIRE.

        WERE I TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN INFORMATION ORIGINATING FROM A
PARTICULAR COMPANY, AGENCY, OR OFFICE, I THINK THAT I WOULD FIND IT FAR MORE
PRODUCTIVE TO TAP A DATA TRANSMISSION THAN TO TAP A VOICE TRANSMISSION, AND
EVEN MORE REWARDING THAN GETTING HARDCOPY DOCUMENTS.

        *SIGNIFICANT & IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS MORE CONCENTRATED IN  A DATA
         TRANSMISSION.
        *SIGNIFICANT & IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS MORE EASILY LOCATED IN DATA
         TRANSMISSIONS THAN IN MASSES OF FILES OR PHONE CALLS.
        *TRANSMITTED DATA IS PRESUMED TRUE, AND WHEN ALTERATION IS DISCOVERED,
         IT'S READILY BLAMED ON THE EQUIPMENT.
        *THE LAWS CONCERNING TAPS ON UNCLASSIFIED AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPUTER
         DATA ARE EITHER QUITE LACKING OR ABJECTLY STUPID.

THE POINT OF ALL THIS IS THAT THE PRUDENT MANAGER REALLY OUGHT TO ENCRYPT ALL
DATA TRANSMISSIONS.  ENCRYPTION PACKAGES ARE CHEAP (A 'DES' PROGRAM IS NOW
PRICED AT $30) AND ARE EASY TO USE.

BUST UPDATE
===========

     All the people busted by the Secret Service last July were contacted in
September and asked if they "wanted to talk."  No one but Solid State heard
from the S.S. after this.  Solid State was prosecuted and got one year
probation plus some required community service.  The rest:  Ninja NYC, Bill
>From RNOC, Oryan QUEST, etc. are still waiting to hear.  Some rumors have gone
around that Oryan QUEST has cooperated extensively with the feds but I have no
idea about the validity of this.  The following is a short interview with
Oryan QUEST.  Remember that QUEST has a habit of lying.

PHRACK:  Did you hear from the SS in September?  It seems everybody else has.

QUEST:  No.  I haven't heard from them since I was busted.  Maybe they forgot
        me.

P:  What's your lawyer think of your case?

Q:  He says lay low.  He says it's no problem because of my age.

P:  What do your parents think?

Q:  They were REALLY pissed for about a week but then they relaxed.  I mean I
    think my parents knew I went through enough... I mean I felt like shit.

P:  Do you plan to keep involved in Telecom legit or otherwise?

Q:  Uhh, I wanna call boards... I mean I can understand why a sysop wouldn't
    give me an access but... I'm thinking of putting a board up, a secure
    board just to stay in touch ya know?  Cause I had a lot of fun I mean I
    just don't want to get busted again.

P:  Any further words of wisdom?

Q:  No matter what anyone says I'm *ELITE*.  NOOOO don't put that.

P:  Yes I am.

Q:  No I don't want people to think I'm a dick.

P:  Well...

Q:  You're a dick.


- On a completely different note, Taran King who as some of you know was
  busted, is going to be writing a file for Phrack about what happened real
  soon now.


MEDIA
=====

     The big media thing has been scare stories about computer viruses,
culminating in a one page Newsweek article written by good old Sandza and
friends.  John Markoff of the San Francisco Examiner wrote articles on
viruses, hacking voice mailboxes, and one that should come out soon about the
July Busts (centering on Oryan QUEST).  A small scoop:  He may be leaving for
the New York Times or the San Jose Mercury.

     Phreak media wise things have been going downhill.  Besides PHRACK (which
had a bad period but hopefully we're back for good) there is 2600, and
Syndicate Report.  Syndicate Report is dead, although their voice mail system
is up.  Sometimes.  2600 has gone from a monthly magazine to a quarterly one
because they were losing so much money.  One dead and 2 wounded.


MISCELLANEOUS
=============

     Taran King and Knight Lightning are having a fun time in their fraternity
at University of Missouri.  Their respective GPA's are 2.1 and 2.7
approximately.... Phantom Phreaker and Doom Prophet are in a (punk/metal)
band... Lex Luthor is alive and writing long articles for 2600... Sir Francis
Drake sold out and wrote phreak articles for Thrasher... Jester Sluggo has
become vaguely active again...


CONCLUSION
==========

Less and less people are phreaking, the world is in sorry shape, and I'm going
to bed.  Hail Eris.

                          "Illegal Hacker Crackdown"
               from the California Computer News - October 1987
                      Article by Al Simmons - CCN Editor

Hackers beware!

Phone security authorities, the local police, and the Secret Service have been
closing down on illegal hacking - electronic thievery - that is costing the
long-distance communications companies and their customers millions of dollars
annually.  In the U.S., the loss tally on computer fraud, of all kinds, is now
running between $3 billion and $5 a year, according to government sources.

         "San Francisco D.A. Gets First Adult Conviction for Hacking"
                  (After about 18 years, it's a about time!)

San Francisco, District Attorney Arlo Smith recently announced the first
criminal conviction in San Francisco Superior Court involving an adult
computer hacker.

In a report released August 31, the San Francisco District Attorney's office
named defendant Steve Cseh, 25, of San Francisco as having pled guilty earlier
that month to a felony of "obtaining telephone services with fraudulent
intent" (phreaking) by means of a computer.

Cseh was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Laurence Kay to three years
probation and ordered to preform 120 hours of community service.

Judge Kay reduced the offense to a misdemeanor in light of Cseh's making full
restitution to U.S. Sprint - the victim phone company.

At the insistence of the prosecuting attorney, however, the Court ordered Cseh
to turn his computer and modem over to U.S. Sprint to help defray the phone
company's costs in detecting the defendant's thefts.  (That's like big money
there!)

A team of investigators from U.S. Sprint and Pac Tel (the gestapo) worked for
weeks earlier this year to detect the hacking activity and trace it to Cseh's
phone line, D.A. Arlo Smith said.

The case centered around the use of a computer and its software to illegally
acquire a number of their registered users to make long-distance calls.

Cseh's calls were monitored for a three-week period last March.  After tracing
the activity to Cseh's phone line, phone company security people (gestapo
stormtroopers) were able to obtain legal authority, under a federal phone
communications statute, to monitor the origin and duration of the illegal
calls.

Subsequently, the investigators along with Inspector George Walsh of the San
Francisco Police Dept. Fraud Detail obtained a search warrant of Cseh's
residence.  Computer equipment, a software dialing program, and notebooks
filled with codes and phone numbers were among the evidence seized, according
to Asst. D.A. Jerry Coleman who prosecuted the case.

U.S Sprint had initially reported more than $300,000 in losses from the use of
their codes during the past two years; however, the investigation efforts
could only prove specific losses of a lesser amount traceable to Cseh during
the three-week monitoring period.

"It is probable that other computer users had access to the hacked Sprint
codes throughout the country due to dissemination on illegal computer bulletin
boards," added Coleman (When where BBS's made illegal Mr. Coleman?)

          "Sacramento Investigators Breakup Tahoe Electronic Thefts"

Meanwhile, at South Shore Lake Tahoe, Secret Service and phone company
investigators arrested Thomas Gould Alvord, closing down an electronic theft
ring estimated to have rung up more than $2 million in unauthorized calls.

A Sacramento Bee story, filed by the Bee staff writers Ted Bell and Jim Lewis,
reported that Alvord, 37, was arrested September 9, on five felony counts of
computer hacking of long-distance access codes to five private telephone
companies.

Alvord is said to have used an automatic dialer, with computer programmed
dialing formulas, enabling him to find long-distance credit card numbers used
by clients of private telephone companies, according to an affidavit filed in
Sacramento's District Court.

The affidavit, filed by William S. Granger, a special agent of the Secret
Service, identified Paula Hayes, an investigator for Tel-America of Salt Lake
City, as the undercover agent who finally brought an end to Alvord's South
Shore Electronic Co. illegal hacking operation. Hayes worked undercover to
purchase access codes from Alvord.

Agent Garanger's affidavit lists U.S. Sprint losses at $340,000 but Sprint
spokesman Jenay Cottrell said that figure "could grow considerably," according
to the Bee report.

One stock brokerage firm, is reported to have seen its monthly Pacific Bell
telephone bill climb steadily from $3,000 in April to $72,000 in August.  The
long-distance access codes of the firm were among those traced to Alvord's
telephones, according to investigators the Bee said.

Alvord was reportedly hacking access codes from Sprint, Pacific Bell, and
other companies and was selling them to truck drivers for $60 a month.  Alvord
charged companies making overseas calls and larger businesses between $120 and
$300 a month for the long-distance services of his South Shore Electronics Co.

In California prisons, inmates use "the code" to make free telephone calls
lining up everything from gun running jobs to visits from grandma.

In a college dormitory in Tennessee, students use the code to open up a
long-distance line on a pay phone for 12 straight hours of free calls.

In a phone booth somewhere in the Midwest, a mobster uses the code to make
untraceable calls that bring a shipment of narcotics from South America to the
United States.

The code is actually millions of different personal identification numbers
assigned by the nation's telephone companies.  Fraudulent use of those codes
is now a nationwide epidemic that is costing America's phone companies more
than $500 million each year.

In the end, most of that cost is passed on to consumers, in the form of higher
phone rates, analysts say.

The security codes range form multidigit access codes used by customers of the
many alternative long-distance companies to the "calling card" numbers
assigned by America Telephone & Telegraph and the 22 local phone companies,
such as Pacific Bell.

Most of the loss comes form the activities of computer hackers, said Rene
Dunn, speaking for U.S. Sprint, the third-largest long-distance company.

These technical experts - frequently bright, if socially reclusive, teenagers
- set up their computers to dial the local access telephone number of one of
the alternative long-distance firms, such as MCI and U.S. Sprint.  When the
phone answers, a legitimate customer would normally punch in a secret personal
code, usually five digits, that allows him to make his call.

Hackers, however, have devised computer programs that will keep firing
combinations of numbers until it hits the right combination, much like a
safecracker waiting for the telltale sound of pins and tumblers meshing.

Then the hacker- known in the industry as a "cracker" because he has cracked
the code- has full access to that customer's phone line.

The customer does not realize what has happened until a huge phone bill
arrives at the end of the month. By that time, his access number and personal
code have been tacked up on thousands of electronic bulletin boards throughout
the country, accessible to anyone with a computer, a telephone and a modem,
the device that allows the computer to communicate over telephone lines.

"This is definitely a major problem," said one telephone security expert, who
declined to be identified.  "I've seen one account with a $98,000 monthly
bill."

One Berkeley man has battled the telephone cheats since last fall, when his
MCI bill showed about $100 in long-distance calls he had not made.

Although MCI assured him that the problem would be taken care of, the man's
latest bill was 11 pages long and has $563.40 worth of long-distance calls.
Those calls include:

[]  A two-hour call to Hyattsville, Maryland, on January 22.  A woman who
    answered the Hyattsville phone said she had no idea who called her house.

[]  Repeated calls to a dormitory telephone at UCLA.  The student who answered
    the phone there said she did not know who spent 39 minutes talking to her,
    or her roommate, shortly after midnight on January 23.

[]  Calls to dormitory rooms at Washington State University in Pullman and to
    the University of Colorado in Boulder.  Men who answered the phones there
    professed ignorance of who had called them or of any stolen long-distance
    codes.

The Berkeley customer, who asked not to be identified, said he reached his
frustration limit and canceled his MCI account.

The phone companies are pursing the hackers and other thieves with methods
that try to keep up with a technological monster that is linked by trillions
of miles of telephone lines.

The companies sometimes monitor customers' phone bills.  If a bill that
averages about $40 or $50 a month suddenly soars to several hundred dollars
with calls apparently placed from all over the country on the same day, the
phone company flags the bill and tries to track the source of the calls.

The FBI makes its own surveillance sweeps of electronic bulletin boards,
looking for stolen code numbers.  The phone companies occasionally call up
these boards and post messages, warning that arrest warrants will be coming
soon if the fraudulent practice does not stop.  Reputable bulletin boards post
their own warnings to telephone hackers, telling them to stay out.

Several criminal prosecutions are already in the works, said Jocelyne Calia,
the manager of toll fraud for U.S. Sprint.

If the detectives do not want to talk about their methods, the underground is
equally circumspect.  "If they (the companies) have effective (prevention)
methods, how come all this is still going on?" asked one computer expert, a
veteran hacker who says he went legitimate about 10 years ago.

The computer expert, who identified himself only as Dr. Strange, said he was
part of the original group of electronic wizards of the early 1970s who
devised the "blue boxes" complex instruments that emulate the tones of a
telephone and allowed these early hackers to break into the toll-free 800
system and call all over the world free of charge.

The new hacker bedeviling the phone companies are simply the result of the
"technology changing to one of computers, instead of blue boxes" Dr. Strange
said.  As the "phone company elevates the odds... the bigger a challenge it
becomes," he said.

A feeling of ambivalence toward the huge and largely anonymous phone companies
makes it easier for many people to rationalize their cheating.  A woman in a
Southwestern state who obtained an authorization code from her boyfriend said,
through an intermediary, that she never really thought of telephone fraud as a
"moral issue."  "I don't abuse it," the woman said of her newfound telephone
privilege.  "I don't use it for long periods of time - I never talk for more
than an hour at a time - and I don't give it out to friends."  Besides, she
said, the bills for calls she has been making all over the United States for
the past six weeks go to a "large corporation that I was dissatisfied with.
It's not as if an individual is getting the bills."

There is one place, however, where the phone companies maybe have the upper
hand in their constant war with the hackers and cheats.

In some prisons, said an MCI spokesman, "we've found we can use peer pressure.
Let's say we restrict access to the phones, or even take them out, and there
were a lot of prisoners who weren't abusing the phone system.  So the word
gets spread to those guys about which prisoner it was that caused the
telephones to get taken out.  Once you get the identification (of the
phone-abusing prisoner) out there, I don't think you have to worry much" the
spokesman said.  "There's a justice system in the prisons, too."
