After our first release we got wind of some strange rumours.  So  just
to be sure, we need to clarify some facts.                            
                                                                      
So, who are we? First, lets talk about some things we are not. We  are
not an underground rival kiddy group. We are not a cyber  mafia  gang.
We are the watchmen, the hackers who quietly observe the scene. If any
skiddy community gets too big, we shut them down. If any lamer  causes
too much trouble, we shut them down. If any group keeps fucking  stuff
up, we stop them.                                                     
                                                                      
So, why are we doing this? Some people say that being a  vigilanty  is
wrong and that we are actually criminals. What can we say? This may be
true. But the way we see it, if your not part of  the  solution,  your
part of the fucking problem. These idiots spread  garbage  across  our
scene and that is why they got owned. We take pride in what is left of
the scene and we have serious problems with those who rape it.        
                                                                      
That's why we do what MUST be done.                                   
                                                                      
There are some things left we would  like  to  say  about  carders.cc.
First of all, they came back online after they got rm'ed. In the first
issue we gave our word that we would make sure carders.cc would  never
come back. Well, we delivered on that promise in this  issue.  And  as
such carders.cc has once again been eliminated. Maybe this  time  they
will get the hint.                                                    
                                                                      
Also, Heise Security said  that  we  were  a  rival  group  trying  to
capitalize on the demise of carders.cc. Apparently they weren't  happy
about our disclosure of the  carders.cc  database  that  included  the
personal information of carders.cc victims. What Heise forgot was that
with this action, all the victims of  carders.cc  got  the  chance  to
realize that they were victims of fraud. You can try to say  that  our
disclosure of the database put them at even greater risk of fraud  but
we disagree. What is more risky? Having your information  secretly  on
an "underground" carding forum where it  WILL  be  sold  and  used  in
frauduelent activity? Or, having  it  released  so  that  you  can  be
notified and take the appropriate action to mitigate the  damage  that
has been done? I know which option I'd rather have.                   
                                                                      
It is quite impressive how many people wrote about  the  Carders  Hack
without even bothering to read the zine. It is hilarious  to  see  how
the media works. Somebody writes an article, others  copy  information
from it, others copy from it again. If we take a shit in a bowl.  Then
you eat that shit and puke it back into a different bowl  for  someone
else to eat then they do the  same  thing,  what  do  you  have?  "Two
Journo's One Cup" is what you have. Fucking pathetic.                 
                                                                      
On the other hand, we'd like to thank Brian Krebs. Even if some of his
conclusions were way off the mark, he  was  still  the  first  one  to
report about carders.cc and nearly every other article  was  based  on
Brian's work. At least you didn't eat shit and regurgitate it like the
rest Brian, keep up the good work.                                    
                                                                      
Enough jibber jabber, let's get to business.  You  will  soon  realize
that our targets vary:                                                
                                                                      
We owned ettercap because we were tired of people firing that shit  up
and pretending to be a l33th4x0r sheep who think they are the greatest
hackerz with their ARP  spoofing  toolkitz..  If  you  have  installed
ettercap in the last 5 years you may want to check yo shit (;p).      
                                                                      
We owned offsec including backtrack and exploit-db  because  they  are
fucking security "expert" maggots (oops s/m/f/) who just fail so  hard
at security that we wonder  why  people  really  take  their  training
courses. We imagine it's like open mic night at the laughatorium.     
                                                                      
We owned inj3ct0r because they are lameass wannabe milw0rm kids  whose
sole purpose in life is  to  disclose  XSS  0dayz  in  Joomla  (RSnake
anyone?).                                                             
                                                                      
We owned carders.cc (AGAIN) because they  are  unable  to  learn  from
their mistakes and keep spreading garbage around the underground.     
                                                                      
We owned free-hack  because  they  are  developing  into  one  of  the
largest,  most  arrogant  script-kiddie  breeding   grounds   on   the
intertubez.

Here we go again. We hope that everybody was looking  forward  to  see
carders.cc getting owned again. We kept our word, didn't  we?  Let  us
begin:

Our lazy ninja squad was too drunk to come over and punch you  in  the
fucking face. So we'll just stick to owning you  for  now.  Carders.cc
went down for a few days, but came back as if  nothing  had  happened.
They switched some server admins and installed some  new  software  in
the hopes that they would be safe. They turned on some l33t "security"
settings like PHP's "Safe Mode" and  "Openbase  Dir",  and  they  also
disabled lots of functions. All in all they thought they  were  pretty
locked down. Well, obviously they were fucking  wrong.  It's  hard  to
harden a system when everything is backdoored and unfortunately we are
just too ninja to get stopped by your silly protections. You can never
stop us. We will always  keep owning and exp0sing you.                
                                                                      
No. Matter. What. You. Try.

Attention. This ridiculous banner is *not* part of our zine.  In  fact
it is inj3ct0r's 404 page. We concluded  that  this  banner  perfectly
reflects their retardedness. Their knowledge about security is on  the
same level as their ability to speak proper  english.  For  those  who
don't  know:  inj3ct0r  is  a  clone  of  the  old  milw0rm   project,
administered by some morons called "r0073r", "Sid3^effects" and  "L0rd
CrusAd3r". They are not only  an  exploit-db,  but  also  an  arrogant
community of retarded turks and arabs which tell you how you to  write
your stupid Perl SQL-Injection exploit.                               
                                                                      
All their attention whoring about how they hacked Facebook was driving
us insane and all their moaning about how they have problems with  the
law was just too ridiculous for us  to  let  them  continue  existing.
Actually we did not find out what kind of law problems  they  actually
had. We did however discover how stupid these kids are and  what  crap
they are talking about in their private forum area's. Check it out:

Not only they are sharing CC's, they also think of themselves  as  the
best hackerz on the planet. Here is how they talk about exploit-db and
offsec:

They are calling exploit-db "lamers-db" yet they  don't  see  who  the
real lamers are. Hardly surprising that  the  inj3ct0r  team  did  not
manage their box themselves and instead gave their work  to  some  fat
guy called "asker". But since he left  his  box  rot  with  some  half
updated shit, it was a child's play to tap in and root.

   ~ ettercap ~ !                                                     
                                                                      
You would think that the authors of Ettercap, one of the most  popular
whitehat  pentesting  tools,  would  know  the  basics  of   security.
Apparently they don't, or they just  don't  give  a  shit  about  what
happens to their users.                                               
                                                                      
So, why is their website so  insecure?  Ettercap's  message  board  is
hosted at Sourceforge, so they share a server with thousands of  other
customers. Every single customer  is  able  to  execute  commands  and
access the other project directories. Pretty stupid, eh? You only need
to find one hole in one hosted site and you can access ALL the project
databases. Of course  that  isn't  ALoR's  fault,  it's  Sourceforge's
fault. Regardless, people who care about security and  data  integrity
wouldn't use such a shitty provider,  would  they?  To  be  fair,  the
Ettercap project is dead. Most of the admins have been inactive for  a
few years now, but that  is  no  excuse  for  such  a  security  mess.
Especially since the server was compromised some five years ago.      
                                                                      
Just look at the process list, horrible.  Even  the  worst  perl  bots
(scax) get access. If such a poorly written  bot  can  own  this  box,
everyone can.                                                         
                                                                      
Some  good  advice  to  all  other  people/projects  who   are   using
Sourceforge: Move. There are  enough  good  alternatives.  Yes,  I  am
talking to you Vim, get the fuck out of there.  And  to  all  Ettercap
users: arp  poisoning  is  *not*  hacking.  If  you  want  to  achieve
something real, learn the fundamentals and not how to use a GUI. Don't
sniff the passwords of your friends  and  call  yourself  a  pentester
(looking at you firesheep).

                                                     ! ~ exploit-db ~ 
                                                                      
Now we come to a different topic. A topic about people who  leech  off
what the scene creates  and  call  it  their  own.  About  people  who
copyright ideas and papers about security  related  topics  that  have
been around for years. How many  XSS-Papers  are  there  currently  on
exploit-db? How many retarded strcpy(buf,  argv[1])-papers  are  being
written over and over  again?  About  whitehats  who  think  releasing
exploits would make the world much more safe.  And  because  of  fame.
They all want fame so badly that they do anything  and  everything  in
order to be part of the security industry. What's even more  hilarious
is that these "famous" security people keep  getting  owned.  We  mean
el8, phc, h0no, and zf0  have  all  owned  these  "Security  Rockstar"
faggots and yet, nothing changes. Or the attacks  are  categorized  as
"skiddy" behavior. It's rediculous how terrible the industry is. There
is no accountability anymore.                                         
                                                                      
Still there are some lame skids that need a good spanking.  Stupid  10
year olds who take perl-exploits to destroy  clan-pages  for  fun  and
call  themselves  "hackers"  without  knowing  what  they  are  doing.
Criminals who take exploits to  steal  payment  stuff  for  their  own
selfish financial gain. And  to  get  their  friends  thrown  in  jail
(soup). Fame and money... Get the message?

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.

Since we already tapped into exploit-db and their server lies  in  the
same subnet  with  backtrack,  we  decided  to  check  out  their  mad
security. Backtrack is run by muts, the same guy who also  administers
exploit-db, so no wonder why it was super easy to get a shell...

                                                     ! ~ free-hack ~  
                                                                      
Many people will wonder why we owned  Free-Hack  because  they  always
claimed to have nothing to do with fraud and stuff. In  fact  this  is
the second time we owned them but the first time  we  go  public.  The
first time was a few months ago in order to check out what  they  were
doing in their internal eleet priv8 sections.  To  our  surprise  they
really had nothing to do with fraud.  Still,  they  are  part  of  the
problem we call the skiddy breeding of lameness.                      
                                                                      
Actually, there are a few communities where you can find a few skilled
members. Free-Hack is a forum where you can find  two  or  three.  The
rest are simple skidi0ts who have no right to even exist, let alone be
on our internet. Also  the  admins,  particularly  "Suicide"  aka  Mr.
Stefan Finke or  "enco"  aka  Mr.  Enrico  Costanzo  are  nothing  but
arrogant asshats who's only apparent  talent  appears  to  be  banning
people. Oh wait, "Suicide" actually HAS skill. Like  he  mastered  the
usage of Hydra and is now able to hax every Teamspeak  server.  Ph33r.
Don't get us wrong; J0hn.X3r, a newer admin, is actually a pretty good
guy, who had the right spirit and was willing to  learn.  But  getting
promoted to admin in a "hacker" community with ~40k users which has an
"expert" zone for "skilled" members who talk about how to  bypass  the
Webspell SQL Injection filter is the worst thing he could have done...

| viel Ã„rger (Fettemama, Hacksector, CIA-World, Grey-Hats,           |

You can have that. There's quite alot of hilarity left in the database
backups we prepared. Do not forget to have a  look  for  yourself.  We
especially liked that guy who trolled  fred777  by  logging  into  his
account:

| Warum Ã¼berhaupt umziehen? Der neue Server hat ungefÃ¤hr die         |
| gleichen Attribute wie der Jetzige. Dazu wird die Firewall um das  |
| doppelte verstÃ¤rkt. Im Gesamtpaket komme ich da besser weg, als in |
| der momentanen Situation.                                          |

Wut? What Firewall? We didn't see no stinking firewall. Owait it's us.

We think that novaca!ne's  magic_quotes bypass is quite representative 
for this group:

Bypass magic_quotes (novaca!ne)
magic_quotes is a php setting (php.ini). 
It causes that every ' (single-quote), " (double quote) and  \ (backslash)
are escaped with a backslash automatically, a weak but wellknown securing method.
This is how to bypass it:
Use the funktion called â€žString.fromCharCode()â€œ, you need to translate your MySQL command 
into ascII (http://www.asciizeichen.de/tabelle.html) and put it input into the handling. 
â€˜ OR â€˜aâ€™ = â€˜a equals
String.fromCharCode(8216, 32, 79, 82, 32, 8216, 97, 8217, 32, 61, 32, 8216, 97)

novaca!ne is (next  to fred777) of course, our new security superhero!
Congratz, faggot...                                                   
                                                                      
Finally we shouldn't forget our old fag superhero fred777, who  helped
us to understand how we could get every source code of  a  page.  This
sounds pretty hard, but fred777 shows his priv8  techniques  (we  fear
them):

#     Sourcecode disclosure by social engineering

Intro:
Ich schildere hier mal einen Fall, welchen ich letztens
noch vor mir hatte. Ich war durch Zufall mal wieder auf den
vielen NPD Seiten, um nach LÃ¼cken zu suchen.
Bei einer Subpage wurde ich dann auch fÃ¼ndig, zumindest erweckte
es den Anschein, als ob sich da eine SQL Injection befÃ¤nde.

Sobald nÃ¤mlich der Limitparameter falsch Ã¼bergeben wurde, kam der
Ã¼bliche SQL Error:

---------------------------------------------------------

Rein logisch sah der Query so aus:

SELECT `cats` FROM fred (sonstiges) LIMIT $_GET['la'],10;

Als ich dann mittels eines Scripts versuchte den Query mit UNION
zu erweitern, wollte es aber nicht funktionieren.
Klar dafÃ¼r konnte es so einige GrÃ¼nde geben, allerdings hÃ¤tte
ich mir zu gerne den Source + Abfragen angeschaut.

---------------------------------------------------------

Wieso eigentlich nicht?

Nach einigen Ãœberlegungen, schrieb ich dann eine Mail an den
Webmaster der Seite, mit dem Ziel, dass er mir den Source schickt.

--snip snip--

What we learned is:                                                   
- If we write an email to an admin we always get the source code      
- fred777 uses tools to exploit some sql injection

fred777's master skills" Just to inform you: We owned  Free-Hack  with
