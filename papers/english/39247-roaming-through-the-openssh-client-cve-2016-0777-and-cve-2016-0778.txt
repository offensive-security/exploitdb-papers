Summary
========================================================================

Since version 5.4 (released on March 8, 2010), the OpenSSH client
supports an undocumented feature called roaming: if the connection to an
SSH server breaks unexpectedly, and if the server supports roaming as
well, the client is able to reconnect to the server and resume the
suspended SSH session.

Although roaming is not supported by the OpenSSH server, it is enabled
by default in the OpenSSH client, and contains two vulnerabilities that
can be exploited by a malicious SSH server (or a trusted but compromised
server): an information leak (memory disclosure), and a buffer overflow
(heap-based).

The information leak is exploitable in the default configuration of the
OpenSSH client, and (depending on the client's version, compiler, and
operating system) allows a malicious SSH server to steal the client's
private keys. This information leak may have already been exploited in
the wild by sophisticated attackers, and high-profile sites or users may
need to regenerate their SSH keys accordingly.

The buffer overflow, on the other hand, is present in the default
configuration of the OpenSSH client but its exploitation requires two
non-default options: a ProxyCommand, and either ForwardAgent (-A) or
ForwardX11 (-X). This buffer overflow is therefore unlikely to have any
real-world impact, but provides a particularly interesting case study.

All OpenSSH versions between 5.4 and 7.1 are vulnerable, but can be
easily hot-fixed by setting the undocumented option "UseRoaming" to
"no", as detailed in the Mitigating Factors section. OpenSSH version
7.1p2 (released on January 14, 2016) disables roaming by default.

Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the OpenSSH client connects to an SSH server that offers the key
exchange algorithm "resume@appgate.com", it sends the global request
"roaming@appgate.com" to the server, after successful authentication. If
this request is accepted, the client allocates a roaming buffer out_buf,
by calling malloc() (and not calloc()) with an out_buf_size that is
arbitrarily chosen by the server:

 63 void
 64 roaming_reply(int type, u_int32_t seq, void *ctxt)
 65 {
 66         if (type == SSH2_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE) {
 67                 logit("Server denied roaming");
 68                 return;
 69         }
 70         verbose("Roaming enabled");
 ..
 75         set_out_buffer_size(packet_get_int() + get_snd_buf_size());
 ..
 77 }

 40 static size_t out_buf_size = 0;
 41 static char *out_buf = NULL;
 42 static size_t out_start;
 43 static size_t out_last;
 ..
 75 void
 76 set_out_buffer_size(size_t size)
 77 {
 78         if (size == 0 || size > MAX_ROAMBUF)
 79                 fatal("%s: bad buffer size %lu", __func__, (u_long)size);
 80         /*
 81          * The buffer size can only be set once and the buffer will live
 82          * as long as the session lives.
 83          */
 84         if (out_buf == NULL) {
 85                 out_buf_size = size;
 86                 out_buf = xmalloc(size);
 87                 out_start = 0;
 88                 out_last = 0;
 89         }
 90 }

The OpenSSH client's roaming_write() function, a simple wrapper around
write(), calls wait_for_roaming_reconnect() to transparently reconnect
to the SSH server after a disconnection. It also calls buf_append() to
copy the data sent to the server into the roaming buffer out_buf. During
a reconnection, the client is therefore able to resend the data that was
not received by the server because of the disconnection:

198 void
199 resend_bytes(int fd, u_int64_t *offset)
200 {
201         size_t available, needed;
202
203         if (out_start < out_last)
204                 available = out_last - out_start;
205         else
206                 available = out_buf_size;
207         needed = write_bytes - *offset;
208         debug3("resend_bytes: resend %lu bytes from %llu",
209             (unsigned long)needed, (unsigned long long)*offset);
210         if (needed > available)
211                 fatal("Needed to resend more data than in the cache");
212         if (out_last < needed) {
213                 int chunkend = needed - out_last;
214                 atomicio(vwrite, fd, out_buf + out_buf_size - chunkend,
215                     chunkend);
216                 atomicio(vwrite, fd, out_buf, out_last);
217         } else {
218                 atomicio(vwrite, fd, out_buf + (out_last - needed), needed);
219         }
220 }

In the OpenSSH client's roaming buffer out_buf, the most recent data
sent to the server begins at index out_start and ends at index out_last.
As soon as this circular buffer is full, buf_append() maintains the
invariant "out_start = out_last + 1", and consequently three different
cases have to be considered:

- "out_start < out_last" (lines 203-204): out_buf is not full yet (and
  out_start is still equal to 0), and the amount of data available in
  out_buf is indeed "out_last - out_start";

- "out_start > out_last" (lines 205-206): out_buf is full (and out_start
  is exactly equal to "out_last + 1"), and the amount of data available
  in out_buf is indeed the entire out_buf_size;

- "out_start == out_last" (lines 205-206): no data was ever written to
  out_buf (and both out_start and out_last are still equal to 0) because
  no data was ever sent to the server after roaming_reply() was called,
  but the client sends (leaks) the entire uninitialized out_buf to the
  server (line 214), as if out_buf_size bytes of data were available.

In order to successfully exploit this information leak and retrieve
sensitive information from the OpenSSH client's memory (for example,
private SSH keys, or memory addresses useful for further exploitation),
a malicious server needs to:

- Massage the client's heap before roaming_reply() malloc()ates out_buf,
  and force malloc() to return a previously free()d but uncleansed chunk
  of sensitive information. The simple proof-of-concept in this advisory
  does not implement heap massaging.

- Guess the client's get_snd_buf_size() in order to precisely control
  out_buf_size. OpenSSH < 6.0 accepts out_buf sizes in the range (0,4G),
  and OpenSSH >= 6.0 accepts sizes in the range (0,2M]. Sizes smaller
  than get_snd_buf_size() are attainable because roaming_reply() does
  not protect "packet_get_int() + get_snd_buf_size()" against integer
  wraparound. The proof-of-concept in this advisory attempts to derive
  the client's get_snd_buf_size() from the get_recv_buf_size() sent by
  the client to the server, and simply chooses a random out_buf_size.

- Advise the client's resend_bytes() that all "available" bytes (the
  entire out_buf_size) are "needed" by the server, even if fewer bytes
  were actually written by the client to the server (because the server
  controls the "*offset" argument, and resend_bytes() does not protect
  "needed = write_bytes - *offset" against integer wraparound).

Finally, a brief digression on a minor bug in resend_bytes(): on 64-bit
systems, where "chunkend" is a 32-bit signed integer, but "out_buf" and
"out_buf_size" are 64-bit variables, "out_buf + out_buf_size - chunkend"
may point out-of-bounds, if chunkend is negative (if out_buf_size is in
the [2G,4G) range). This negative chunkend is then converted to a 64-bit
size_t greater than SSIZE_MAX when passed to atomicio(), and eventually
returns EFAULT when passed to write() (at least on Linux and OpenBSD),
thus avoiding an out-of-bounds read from the OpenSSH client's memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private Key Disclosure
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We initially believed that this information leak in the OpenSSH client's
roaming code would not allow a malicious SSH server to steal the
client's private keys, because:

- the information leaked is not read from out-of-bounds memory, but from
  a previously free()d chunk of memory that is recycled to malloc()ate
  the client's roaming buffer out_buf;

- private keys are loaded from disk into memory and freed by key_free()
  (old API, OpenSSH < 6.7) or sshkey_free() (new API, OpenSSH >= 6.7),
  and both functions properly cleanse the private keys' memory with
  OPENSSL_cleanse() or explicit_bzero();

- temporary copies of in-memory private keys are freed by buffer_free()
  (old API) or sshbuf_free() (new API), and both functions attempt to
  cleanse these copies with memset() or bzero().

However, we eventually identified three reasons why, in our experiments,
we were able to partially or completely retrieve the OpenSSH client's
private keys through this information leak (depending on the client's
version, compiler, operating system, heap layout, and private keys):

(besides these three reasons, other reasons may exist, as suggested by
the CentOS and Fedora examples at the end of this section)

1. If a private SSH key is loaded from disk into memory by fopen() (or
fdopen()), fgets(), and fclose(), a partial or complete copy of this
private key may remain uncleansed in memory. Indeed, these functions
manage their own internal buffers, and whether these buffers are
cleansed or not depends on the OpenSSH client's libc (stdio)
implementation, but not on OpenSSH itself.

- In all vulnerable OpenSSH versions, SSH's main() function calls
  load_public_identity_files(), which loads the client's public keys
  with fopen(), fgets(), and fclose(). Unfortunately, the private keys
  (without the ".pub" suffix) are loaded first and then discarded, but
  nonetheless buffered in memory by the stdio functions.

- In OpenSSH versions <= 5.6, the load_identity_file() function (called
  by the client's public-key authentication method) loads a private key
  with fdopen() and PEM_read_PrivateKey(), an OpenSSL function that uses
  fgets() and hence internal stdio buffering.

Internal stdio buffering is the most severe of the three problems
discussed in this section, although GNU/Linux is not affected because
the glibc mmap()s and munmap()s (and therefore cleanses) stdio buffers.
BSD-based systems, on the other hand, are severely affected because they
simply malloc()ate and free() stdio buffers. For interesting comments on
this issue:

https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/MEM06-C.+Ensure+that+sensitive+data+is+not+written+out+to+disk

2. In OpenSSH versions >= 5.9, the client's load_identity_file()
function (called by the public-key authentication method) read()s a
private key in 1024-byte chunks that are appended to a growing buffer (a
realloc()ating buffer) with buffer_append() (old API) or sshbuf_put()
(new API). Unfortunately, the repeated calls to realloc() may leave
partial copies of the private key uncleansed in memory.

- In OpenSSH < 6.7 (old API), the initial size of such a growing buffer
  is 4096 bytes: if a private-key file is larger than 4K, a partial copy
  of this private key may remain uncleansed in memory (a 3K copy in a 4K
  buffer). Fortunately, only the file of a very large RSA key (for
  example, an 8192-bit RSA key) can exceed 4K.

- In OpenSSH >= 6.7 (new API), the initial size of a growing buffer is
  256 bytes: if a private-key file is larger than 1K (the size passed to
  read()), a partial copy of this private key may remain uncleansed in
  memory (a 1K copy in a 1K buffer). For example, the file of a
  default-sized 2048-bit RSA key exceeds 1K.

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/244.html

3. An OpenSSH growing-buffer that holds a private key is eventually
freed by buffer_free() (old API) or sshbuf_free() (new API), and both
functions attempt to cleanse the buffer with memset() or bzero() before
they call free(). Unfortunately, an optimizing compiler may remove this
memset() or bzero() call, because the buffer is written to, but never
again read from (an optimization known as Dead Store Elimination).

OpenSSH 6.6 is the only version that is not affected, because it calls
explicit_bzero() instead of memset() or bzero().

Dead Store Elimination is the least severe of the three problems
explored in this section, because older GCC versions do not remove the
memset() or bzero() call made by buffer_free() or sshbuf_free(). GCC 5
and Clang/LLVM do, however, remove it. For detailed discussions of this
issue:

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/14.html

https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2014-12/threads.html#00506

Finally, for these three reasons, passphrase-encrypted SSH keys are
leaked in their encrypted form, but an attacker may attempt to crack the
passphrase offline. On the other hand, SSH keys that are available only
through an authentication agent are never leaked, in any form.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitigating Factors
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information leak affects all OpenSSH clients >= 5.4, but its impact
is slightly reduced by the following four reasons:

1. The vulnerable roaming code can be permanently disabled by adding the
undocumented option "UseRoaming no" to the system-wide configuration
file (usually /etc/ssh/ssh_config), or per-user configuration file
(~/.ssh/config), or command-line (-o "UseRoaming no").

2. If an OpenSSH client is disconnected from an SSH server that offers
roaming, it prints "[connection suspended, press return to resume]" on
stderr, and waits for '\n' or '\r' on stdin (and not on the controlling
terminal) before it reconnects to the server; advanced users may become
suspicious and press Control-C or Control-Z instead, thus avoiding the
information leak:

# "`pwd`"/sshd -o ListenAddress=127.0.0.1:222 -o UsePrivilegeSeparation=no -f /dev/null -h /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

$ /usr/bin/ssh -p 222 127.0.0.1
[connection suspended, press return to resume]^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /usr/bin/ssh -p 222 127.0.0.1

However, SSH commands that use the local stdin to transfer data to the
remote server are bound to trigger this reconnection automatically (upon
reading a '\n' or '\r' from stdin). Moreover, these non-interactive SSH
commands (for example, backup scripts and cron jobs) commonly employ
public-key authentication and are therefore perfect targets for this
information leak:

$ ls -l /etc/passwd | /usr/bin/ssh -p 222 127.0.0.1 "cat > /tmp/passwd.ls"
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][exiting]

$ tar -cf - /etc/passwd | /usr/bin/ssh -p 222 127.0.0.1 "cat > /tmp/passwd.tar"
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
...
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][exiting]

Similarly, the SCP client uses the SSH client's stdin and stdout to
transfer data, and can be forced by a malicious SSH server to output a
control record that ends in '\n' (an error message in server-to-client
mode, or file permissions in client-to-server mode); this '\n' is then
read from stdin by the fgetc() call in wait_for_roaming_reconnect(), and
triggers an automatic reconnection that allows the information leak to
be exploited without user interaction:

# env ROAMING="scp_mode sleep:1" "`pwd`"/sshd -o ListenAddress=127.0.0.1:222 -o UsePrivilegeSeparation=no -f /dev/null -h /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

$ /usr/bin/scp -P 222 127.0.0.1:/etc/passwd /tmp
$ [connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][exiting]

$ /usr/bin/scp -P 222 /etc/passwd 127.0.0.1:/tmp
[connection suspended, press return to resume][connection resumed]
[connection suspended, press return to resume][exiting]
lost connection

3. Although a man-in-the-middle attacker can reset the TCP connection
between an OpenSSH client and an OpenSSH server (which does not support
roaming), it cannot exploit the information leak without breaking server
host authentication or integrity protection, because it needs to:

- first, append the "resume@appgate.com" algorithm name to the server's
  initial key exchange message;

- second, in response to the client's "roaming@appgate.com" request,
  change the server's reply from failure to success.

In conclusion, an attacker who wishes to exploit this information leak
must convince its target OpenSSH client to connect to a malicious server
(an unlikely scenario), or compromise a trusted server (a more likely
scenario, for a determined attacker).

4. We discovered several non-security bugs, in specific versions and
configurations of OpenSSH, that prevent the client's roaming code from
reconnecting to the server and, as a result, prevent this information
leak from being exploited. In the client, wait_for_roaming_reconnect()
calls ssh_connect(), the same function that successfully established the
first connection to the server; this function supports four different
connection methods, but each method contains a bug and may fail to
establish a second connection to the server:

- In OpenSSH >= 6.5 (released on January 30, 2014), the default
  ssh_connect_direct() method (a simple TCP connection) is called by
  wait_for_roaming_reconnect() with a NULL aitop argument, which makes
  it impossible for the client to reconnect to the server:

 418 static int
 419 ssh_connect_direct(const char *host, struct addrinfo *aitop,
 ...
 424         int sock = -1, attempt;
 425         char ntop[NI_MAXHOST], strport[NI_MAXSERV];
 ...
 430         for (attempt = 0; attempt < connection_attempts; attempt++) {
 ...
 440                 for (ai = aitop; ai; ai = ai->ai_next) {
 ...
 470                 }
 471                 if (sock != -1)
 472                         break;  /* Successful connection. */
 473         }
 474
 475         /* Return failure if we didn't get a successful connection. */
 476         if (sock == -1) {
 477                 error("ssh: connect to host %s port %s: %s",
 478                     host, strport, strerror(errno));
 479                 return (-1);
 480         }

  Incidentally, this error() call displays stack memory from the
  uninitialized strport[] array, a byproduct of the NULL aitop:

$ /usr/bin/ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.8, LibreSSL 2.1

$ /usr/bin/ssh -p 222 127.0.0.1
user@127.0.0.1's password:
[connection suspended, press return to resume]ssh: connect to host 127.0.0.1 port \300\350\226\373\341: Bad file descriptor

[reconnect failed, press return to retry]ssh: connect to host 127.0.0.1 port \300\350\226\373\341: Bad file descriptor

- The special ProxyCommand "-" communicates with the server through the
  client's stdin and stdout, but these file descriptors are close()d by
  packet_backup_state() at the beginning of wait_for_roaming_reconnect()
  and are never reopened again, making it impossible for the client to
  reconnect to the server. Moreover, the fgetc() that waits for '\n' or
  '\r' on the closed stdin returns EOF and forces the client to exit():

$ /usr/bin/ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.4p1, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013

$ /usr/bin/nc -e "/usr/bin/ssh -o ProxyCommand=- -p 222 127.0.0.1" 127.0.0.1 222
Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
user@127.0.0.1's password:
[connection suspended, press return to resume][exiting]

- The method ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect() fork()s a ProxyCommand that
  passes a connected file descriptor back to the client, but it calls
  fatal() while reconnecting to the server, because waitpid() returns
  ECHILD; indeed, the SIGCHLD handler (installed by SSH's main() after
  the first successful connection to the server) calls waitpid() before
  ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect() does:

1782 static void
1783 main_sigchld_handler(int sig)
1784 {
....
1789         while ((pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG)) > 0 ||
1790             (pid < 0 && errno == EINTR))
1791                 ;
1792
1793         signal(sig, main_sigchld_handler);
....
1795 }

 101 static int
 102 ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect(const char *host, u_short port,
 103     const char *proxy_command)
 104 {
 ...
 121         /* Fork and execute the proxy command. */
 122         if ((pid = fork()) == 0) {
 ...
 157         }
 158         /* Parent. */
 ...
 167         while (waitpid(pid, NULL, 0) == -1)
 168                 if (errno != EINTR)
 169                         fatal("Couldn't wait for child: %s", strerror(errno));

$ /usr/bin/ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.6.1p1, OpenSSL 1.0.1p-freebsd 9 Jul 2015

$ /usr/bin/ssh -o ProxyUseFdpass=yes -o ProxyCommand="/usr/bin/nc -F %h %p" -p 222 127.0.0.1
user@127.0.0.1's password:
[connection suspended, press return to resume]Couldn't wait for child: No child processes

- The method ssh_proxy_connect() fork()s a standard ProxyCommand that
  connects the client to the server, but if a disconnection occurs, and
  the SIGCHLD of the terminated ProxyCommand is caught while fgetc() is
  waiting for a '\n' or '\r' on stdin, EOF is returned (the underlying
  read() returns EINTR) and the client exit()s before it can reconnect
  to the server:

$ /usr/bin/ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014

$ /usr/bin/ssh -o ProxyCommand="/bin/nc %h %p" -p 222 127.0.0.1
user@127.0.0.1's password:
[connection suspended, press return to resume][exiting]

  This behavior is intriguing, because (at least on Linux and BSD) the
  signal() call that installed the main_sigchld_handler() is supposed to
  be equivalent to a sigaction() call with SA_RESTART. However, portable
  versions of OpenSSH override signal() with mysignal(), a function that
  calls sigaction() without SA_RESTART.

  This last mitigating factor is actually a race-condition bug that
  depends on the ProxyCommand itself: for example, the client never
  fails to reconnect to the server when using Socat as a ProxyCommand,

========================================================================
Buffer Overflow (CVE-2016-0778)
========================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for roaming was elegantly added to the OpenSSH client: the calls
to read() and write() that communicate with the SSH server were replaced
by calls to roaming_read() and roaming_write(), two wrappers that depend
on wait_for_roaming_reconnect() to transparently reconnect to the server
after a disconnection. The wait_for_roaming_reconnect() routine is
essentially a sequence of four subroutines:

239 int
240 wait_for_roaming_reconnect(void)
241 {
...
250         fprintf(stderr, "[connection suspended, press return to resume]");
...
252         packet_backup_state();
253         /* TODO Perhaps we should read from tty here */
254         while ((c = fgetc(stdin)) != EOF) {
...
259                 if (c != '\n' && c != '\r')
260                         continue;
261
262                 if (ssh_connect(host, &hostaddr, options.port,
...
265                     options.proxy_command) == 0 && roaming_resume() == 0) {
266                         packet_restore_state();
...
268                         fprintf(stderr, "[connection resumed]\n");
...
270                         return 0;
271                 }
272
273                 fprintf(stderr, "[reconnect failed, press return to retry]");
...
275         }
276         fprintf(stderr, "[exiting]\n");
...
278         exit(0);
279 }

1. packet_backup_state() close()s connection_in and connection_out (the
old file descriptors that connected the client to the server), and saves
the state of the suspended SSH session (for example, the encryption and
decryption contexts).

2. ssh_connect() opens new file descriptors, and connects them to the
SSH server.

3. roaming_resume() negotiates the resumption of the suspended SSH
session with the server, and calls resend_bytes().

4. packet_restore_state() updates connection_in and connection_out (with
the new file descriptors that connect the client to the server), and
restores the state of the suspended SSH session.

The new file descriptors for connection_in and connection_out may differ
from the old ones (if, for example, files or pipes or sockets are opened
or closed between two successive ssh_connect() calls), but unfortunately
historical code in OpenSSH assumes that they are constant:

- In client_loop(), the variables connection_in and connection_out are
  cached locally, but packet_write_poll() calls roaming_write(), which
  may assign new values to connection_in and connection_out (if a
  reconnection occurs), and client_wait_until_can_do_something()
  subsequently reuses the old, cached values.

- client_loop() eventually updates these cached values, and the
  following FD_ISSET() uses a new, updated file descriptor (the fd
  connection_out), but an old, out-of-date file descriptor set (the
  fd_set writeset).

- packet_read_seqnr() (old API, or ssh_packet_read_seqnr(), new API)
  first calloc()ates setp, a file descriptor set for connection_in;
  next, it loops around memset(), FD_SET(), select() and roaming_read();
  last, it free()s setp and returns. Unfortunately, roaming_read() may
  reassign a higher value to connection_in (if a reconnection occurs),
  but setp is never enlarged, and the following memset() and FD_SET()
  may therefore overflow setp (a heap-based buffer overflow):

1048 int
1049 packet_read_seqnr(u_int32_t *seqnr_p)
1050 {
....
1052         fd_set *setp;
....
1058         setp = (fd_set *)xcalloc(howmany(active_state->connection_in + 1,
1059             NFDBITS), sizeof(fd_mask));
....
1065         for (;;) {
....
1075                 if (type != SSH_MSG_NONE) {
1076                         free(setp);
1077                         return type;
1078                 }
....
1083                 memset(setp, 0, howmany(active_state->connection_in + 1,
1084                     NFDBITS) * sizeof(fd_mask));
1085                 FD_SET(active_state->connection_in, setp);
....
1092                 for (;;) {
....
1097                         if ((ret = select(active_state->connection_in + 1, setp,
1098                             NULL, NULL, timeoutp)) >= 0)
1099                                 break;
....
1115                 }
....
1117                 do {
....
1119                         len = roaming_read(active_state->connection_in, buf,
1120                             sizeof(buf), &cont);
1121                 } while (len == 0 && cont);
....
1130         }
1131         /* NOTREACHED */
1132 }

- packet_write_wait() (old API, or ssh_packet_write_wait(), new API) is
  basically similar to packet_read_seqnr() and may overflow its own setp
  if roaming_write() (called by packet_write_poll()) reassigns a higher
  value to connection_out (after a successful reconnection):

1739 void
1740 packet_write_wait(void)
1741 {
1742         fd_set *setp;
....
1746         setp = (fd_set *)xcalloc(howmany(active_state->connection_out + 1,
1747             NFDBITS), sizeof(fd_mask));
1748         packet_write_poll();
1749         while (packet_have_data_to_write()) {
1750                 memset(setp, 0, howmany(active_state->connection_out + 1,
1751                     NFDBITS) * sizeof(fd_mask));
1752                 FD_SET(active_state->connection_out, setp);
....
1758                 for (;;) {
....
1763                         if ((ret = select(active_state->connection_out + 1,
1764                             NULL, setp, NULL, timeoutp)) >= 0)
1765                                 break;
....
1776                 }
....
1782                 packet_write_poll();
1783         }
1784         free(setp);
1785 }

Mitigating Factors
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This buffer overflow affects all OpenSSH clients >= 5.4, but its impact
is significantly reduced by the Mitigating Factors detailed in the
Information Leak section, and additionally:

- OpenSSH versions >= 6.8 reimplement packet_backup_state() and
  packet_restore_state(), but introduce a bug that prevents the buffer
  overflow from being exploited; indeed, ssh_packet_backup_state() swaps
  two local pointers, ssh and backup_state, instead of swapping the two
  global pointers active_state and backup_state:

  9 struct ssh *active_state, *backup_state;
...
238 void
239 packet_backup_state(void)
240 {
241         ssh_packet_backup_state(active_state, backup_state);
242 }
243
244 void
245 packet_restore_state(void)
246 {
247         ssh_packet_restore_state(active_state, backup_state);
248 }

2269 void
2270 ssh_packet_backup_state(struct ssh *ssh,
2271     struct ssh *backup_state)
2272 {
2273         struct ssh *tmp;
....
2279         if (backup_state)
2280                 tmp = backup_state;
2281         else
2282                 tmp = ssh_alloc_session_state();
2283         backup_state = ssh;
2284         ssh = tmp;
2285 }
....
2291 void
2292 ssh_packet_restore_state(struct ssh *ssh,
2293     struct ssh *backup_state)
2294 {
2295         struct ssh *tmp;
....
2299         tmp = backup_state;
2300         backup_state = ssh;
2301         ssh = tmp;
2302         ssh->state->connection_in = backup_state->state->connection_in;

  As a result, the global pointer backup_state is still NULL when passed
  to ssh_packet_restore_state(), and crashes the OpenSSH client when
  dereferenced:

# env ROAMING="overflow:A fd_leaks:0" "`pwd`"/sshd -o ListenAddress=127.0.0.1:222 -o UsePrivilegeSeparation=no -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config -h /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

$ /usr/bin/ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.8, LibreSSL 2.1

$ /usr/bin/ssh -o ProxyCommand="/usr/bin/nc -w 15 %h %p" -p 222 127.0.0.1
user@127.0.0.1's password:
[connection suspended, press return to resume]Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  This bug prevents the buffer overflow from being exploited, but not
  the information leak, because the vulnerable function resend_bytes()
  is called before ssh_packet_restore_state() crashes.

- To the best of our knowledge, this buffer overflow is not exploitable
  in the default configuration of the OpenSSH client; the conclusion of
  the File Descriptor Leak section suggests that two non-default options
  are required: a ProxyCommand, and either ForwardAgent (-A) or
  ForwardX11 (-X).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Descriptor Leak
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that, in order to increase
the file descriptor connection_in or connection_out, and thus overflow
the file descriptor set setp in packet_read_seqnr() or
packet_write_wait(), a file descriptor leak is needed:

- First, the number of bytes calloc()ated for setp is rounded up to the
  nearest multiple of sizeof(fd_mask): 8 bytes (or 64 file descriptors)
  on 64-bit systems.

- Next, in glibc, this number is rounded up to the nearest multiple of
  MALLOC_ALIGNMENT: 16 bytes (or 128 file descriptors) on 64-bit
  systems.

- Last, in glibc, a MIN_CHUNK_SIZE is enforced: 32 bytes on 64-bit
  systems, of which 24 bytes (or 192 file descriptors) are reserved for
  setp.

- In conclusion, a file descriptor leak is needed, because connection_in
  or connection_out has to be increased by hundreds in order to overflow
  setp.

The search for a suitable file descriptor leak begins with a study of
the behavior of the four ssh_connect() methods, when called for a
reconnection by wait_for_roaming_reconnect():

1. The default method ssh_connect_direct() communicates with the server
through a simple TCP socket: the two file descriptors connection_in and
connection_out are both equal to this socket's file descriptor.

In wait_for_roaming_reconnect(), the low-numbered file descriptor of the
old TCP socket is close()d by packet_backup_state(), but immediately
reused for the new TCP socket in ssh_connect_direct(): the new file
descriptors connection_in and connection_out are equal to this old,
low-numbered file descriptor, and cannot possibly overflow setp.

2. The special ProxyCommand "-" communicates with the server through
stdin and stdout, but (as explained in the Mitigating Factors of the
Information Leak section) it cannot possibly reconnect to the server,
and is therefore immune to this buffer overflow.

3. Surprisingly, we discovered a file descriptor leak in the
ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect() method itself; indeed, the file descriptor
sp[1] is never close()d:

 101 static int
 102 ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect(const char *host, u_short port,
 103     const char *proxy_command)
 104 {
 ...
 106         int sp[2], sock;
 ...
 113         if (socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sp) < 0)
 114                 fatal("Could not create socketpair to communicate with "
 115                     "proxy dialer: %.100s", strerror(errno));
 ...
 161         close(sp[0]);
 ...
 164         if ((sock = mm_receive_fd(sp[1])) == -1)
 165                 fatal("proxy dialer did not pass back a connection");
 ...
 171         /* Set the connection file descriptors. */
 172         packet_set_connection(sock, sock);
 173
 174         return 0;
 175 }

However, two different reasons prevent this file descriptor leak from
triggering the setp overflow:

- The method ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect() communicates with the server
  through a single socket received from the ProxyCommand: the two file
  descriptors connection_in and connection_out are both equal to this
  socket's file descriptor.

  In wait_for_roaming_reconnect(), the low-numbered file descriptor of
  the old socket is close()d by packet_backup_state(), reused for sp[0]
  in ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect(), close()d again, and eventually reused
  again for the new socket: the new file descriptors connection_in and
  connection_out are equal to this old, low-numbered file descriptor,
  and cannot possibly overflow setp.

- Because of the waitpid() bug described in the Mitigating Factors of
  the Information Leak section, the method ssh_proxy_fdpass_connect()
  calls fatal() before it returns to wait_for_roaming_reconnect(), and
  is therefore immune to this buffer overflow.

4. The method ssh_proxy_connect() communicates with the server through a
ProxyCommand and two different pipes: the file descriptor connection_in
is the read end of the second pipe (pout[0]), and the file descriptor
connection_out is the write end of the first pipe (pin[1]):

 180 static int
 181 ssh_proxy_connect(const char *host, u_short port, const char *proxy_command)
 182 {
 ...
 184         int pin[2], pout[2];
 ...
 192         if (pipe(pin) < 0 || pipe(pout) < 0)
 193                 fatal("Could not create pipes to communicate with the proxy: %.100s",
 194                     strerror(errno));
 ...
 240         /* Close child side of the descriptors. */
 241         close(pin[0]);
 242         close(pout[1]);
 ...
 247         /* Set the connection file descriptors. */
 248         packet_set_connection(pout[0], pin[1]);
 249
 250         /* Indicate OK return */
 251         return 0;
 252 }

In wait_for_roaming_reconnect(), the two old, low-numbered file
descriptors connection_in and connection_out are both close()d by
packet_backup_state(), and immediately reused for the pipe(pin) in
ssh_proxy_connect(): the new connection_out (pin[1]) is equal to one of
these old, low-numbered file descriptors, and cannot possibly overflow
setp.

On the other hand, the pipe(pout) in ssh_proxy_connect() may return
high-numbered file descriptors, and the new connection_in (pout[0]) may
therefore overflow setp, if hundreds of file descriptors were leaked
before the call to wait_for_roaming_reconnect():

- We discovered a file descriptor leak in the pubkey_prepare() function
  of OpenSSH >= 6.8; indeed, if the client is running an authentication
  agent that does not offer any private keys, the reference to agent_fd
  is lost, and this file descriptor is never close()d:

1194 static void
1195 pubkey_prepare(Authctxt *authctxt)
1196 {
....
1200         int agent_fd, i, r, found;
....
1247         if ((r = ssh_get_authentication_socket(&agent_fd)) != 0) {
1248                 if (r != SSH_ERR_AGENT_NOT_PRESENT)
1249                         debug("%s: ssh_get_authentication_socket: %s",
1250                             __func__, ssh_err(r));
1251         } else if ((r = ssh_fetch_identitylist(agent_fd, 2, &idlist)) != 0) {
1252                 if (r != SSH_ERR_AGENT_NO_IDENTITIES)
1253                         debug("%s: ssh_fetch_identitylist: %s",
1254                             __func__, ssh_err(r));
1255         } else {
....
1288                 authctxt->agent_fd = agent_fd;
1289         }
....
1299 }

  However, OpenSSH clients >= 6.8 crash in ssh_packet_restore_state()
  (because of the NULL-pointer dereference discussed in the Mitigating
  Factors of the Buffer Overflow section) and are immune to the setp
  overflow, despite this agent_fd leak.

- If ForwardAgent (-A) or ForwardX11 (-X) is enabled in the OpenSSH
  client (it is disabled by default), a malicious SSH server can request
  hundreds of forwardings, in order to increase connection_in (each
  forwarding opens a file descriptor), and thus overflow setp in
  packet_read_seqnr():

# env ROAMING="overflow:A" "`pwd`"/sshd -o ListenAddress=127.0.0.1:222 -o UsePrivilegeSeparation=no -f /dev/null -h /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

$ /usr/bin/ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014

$ /usr/bin/ssh-agent -- /usr/bin/ssh -A -o ProxyCommand="/usr/bin/socat - TCP4:%h:%p" -p 222 127.0.0.1

*** Error in `/usr/bin/ssh': malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00007fdcc2a3abc0 ***

Finally, a brief digression on two unexpected problems that had to be
solved in our proof-of-concept:

- First, setp can be overflowed only in packet_read_seqnr(), not in
  packet_write_wait(), but agent forwarding and X11 forwarding are post-
  authentication functionalities, and post-authentication calls to
  packet_read() or packet_read_expect() are scarce, except in the
  key-exchange code of OpenSSH clients < 6.8: our proof-of-concept
  effectively forces a rekeying in order to overflow setp in
  packet_read_seqnr().

- Second, after a successful reconnection, packet_read_seqnr() may call
  fatal("Read from socket failed: %.100s", ...), because roaming_read()
  may return EAGAIN (EAGAIN is never returned without the reconnection,
  because the preceding call to select() guarantees that connection_in
  is ready for read()). Our proof-of-concept works around this problem
  by forcing the client to resend MAX_ROAMBUF bytes (2M) to the server,
  allowing data to reach the client before roaming_read() is called,
  thus avoiding EAGAIN.
