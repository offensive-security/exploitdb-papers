---[ Introduction to the almighty Stack.

The first and most important instructions to understand the stack are
push and pop.

The `pushl %eax` instruction in C looks like:

esp = esp - (sizeof(int));
memory[esp] = eax;

and in asm:

subl $4, %esp
movl %eax, (%esp)

While the `popl %eax` in C looks like:

eax = memory[esp];
esp = esp + (sizeof(int));

and in asm:

movl (%esp), %eax
addl $4, %esp

The stack is a data structure that works on the principle of last in first out
(LIFO). LIFO means that the last item put on the stack is the first item that
can be taken off, althought with the stack you cannot remove any item execpt for
the last one put in although you can access the value of any area of the stack
you have permission too. A stack-based computer system is one that is based on
the use of stacks, rather than being register based. The stack starts at high
memory and grows down, so if the stack top starts at the address 0xbfffffff and
we add something thats four bytes to it we have 0xbfffffff-4 which is
0xbffffffb. We can use gdb to do all our hex math for us (assuming you
understand C's printf and format strings).

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfffffff - 4
0xbffffffb

(gdb) quit

This is usually quicker then using a hex calculator as we are usually in gdb
when we need to do this. So lets see this in action, assemble and link this
simple program.

entropy@phalaris asm $ cat stack.s

.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
nop
pushl $100
pushl $200
pushl $300
popl %eax
popl %eax
popl %eax
movl $1, %eax
movl $0, %ebx
int $0x80

entropy@phalaris asm $ as -g stack.s -o stack.o
entropy@phalaris asm $ ld stack.o -o stack

All this program does is push three longs (4 bytes each) onto the stack, then
it pops them off the stack into the register eax. We can pop them off the stack
into and of the general purpose registers, for now it dosent matter which we
use. The next part should be familiar from the last tutorial, its the exit
syscall (move 1 into eax, one is the syscall number for exit, then move 0 into
ebx which is the return value for exit).

What we are expecting to see is this, the stack will start at some address we
will call X for now, the first push should make the stack address X-4 (stack
grows downward toward lower memory remember), then next push should make it X-8,
and the third one X-12. Then the pops should reverse that so when were dont the
third pop the stack address should be back to our original X.

Ok set our breakpoint at the address of the _start label plus one.

(gdb) break *_start+1
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048095: file stack.s, line 5.

List our source code our.

(gdb) list _start
1 .section .text
2 .globl _start
3 _start:
4 nop
5 pushl $100
6 pushl $200
7 pushl $300
8 popl %eax
9 popl %eax
10 popl %eax
(gdb)
11 movl $1, %eax
12 movl $0, %ebx
13 int $0x80

And start the program running.

(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/entropy/asm/stack

Breakpoint 1, _start () at stack.s:5
5 pushl $100
Current language: auto; currently asm

Ok we hit our breakpoint, and are now paused at the first instruction which
is the pushl $100, or push long value 100 onto the stack.

Lets first find what the current value of esp is, esp points to where we
currently are in the stack, hence its name extended stack pointer or esp.

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91d0: 0x00000001

So esp points to the address 0xbfae91d0 and the value at that address is
0x00000001, the value dosent matter for now. This means that the top of our
stack for this program starts at 0xbfae91d0 when we hit our break point.
All elf binaries actually have their stack start at 0xbfffffff which is a
virtual address mapped to a physical one.

When we do this push long we are expecting the address to be 0xbfae91d0 - 4
because, again, longs are four bytes and the stack grows downward to
lower memory addresses. Use gdb to find out what our expected address will be.

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfae91d0 - 4
0xbfae91cc

It appears that after we do this push long esp will point to 0xbfae91cc.
Execute the pushl $100 instruction.

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:6
6 pushl $200

Now examine what esp points to.

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91cc: 0x00000064

It does indeed point to our 0xbfae91cc address, but what is 0x00000064?

Print it in decimal with another printf.

(gdb) printf "%d\n", 0x00000064
100

Its the 100 that was pushed onto the stack, but represented in hex not decimal
(6*16 + 4 = 100).

Where is esp going to point after the next push long? The current address of
esp which is 0xbfae91cc minus another 4.

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfae91cc - 4
0xbfae91c8

Which is 0xbfae91c8, so step again.

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:7
7 pushl $300

Examine what esp points to.

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91c8: 0x000000c8

Its the address we knew it would go to, and the value 0x000000c8 is our 200
in hex.

(gdb) printf "%d\n", 0x000000c8
200

So our last push long will be at 0xbfae91c8 - 4, let see where thats at.

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfae91c8 - 4
0xbfae91c4

Next address should be 0xbfae91c4.

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:8
8 popl %eax

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91c4: 0x0000012c

It is, and the value at 0xbfae91c4, 0x0000012c is easily guessable.

(gdb) printf "%d\n", 0x0000012c
300

We are now done out pushes and are going onto the popl's. pop longs pop values
off the stack and into a register, so its going to pop the value off and move
up the stack the size of what was popped.

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91c4: 0x0000012c

The stack value is at 0xbfae91c4, so the first pop will make it 0xbfae91c4 + 4
because we are now going up the stack be removing things.

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfae91c4 + 4
0xbfae91c8

First pop long will make it 0xbfae91c8, let see.

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:9
9 popl %eax

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91c8: 0x000000c8

We calculated the address correct, and the pop long has popped the value that
was at 0xbfae91c4 into eax, so lets check out eax.

(gdb) print $eax
$1 = 300

And its the 300 that was the last thing pushed onto the stack.
Next pop long is another 4 up the stack.

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfae91c8 + 4
0xbfae91cc

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:10
10 popl %eax

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91cc: 0x00000064

And the value in eax now.

(gdb) print $eax
$2 = 200

Another 4 up.

(gdb) printf "0x%x\n", 0xbfae91cc + 4
0xbfae91d0

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:11
11 movl $1, %eax

(gdb) x $esp
0xbfae91d0: 0x00000001

Final value popped into eax, also notice the value of esp is 0xbfae91d0, exactly
what we started with.

(gdb) print $eax
$1 = 100

(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:12
12 movl $0, %ebx
(gdb) step
_start () at stack.s:13
13 int $0x80
(gdb) step
Program exited normally.

(gdb) quit
entropy@phalaris asm $


At the start of the program:
Stack top is 0xbfae91d0 (I show the values on the stack as 0x00000000 when they
will usually have the old values left on the stack from previous stack frames).

All that is left is to do exit syscall. The stack is pretty easy to
understand and work with, after you have stepped through it a bunch.
