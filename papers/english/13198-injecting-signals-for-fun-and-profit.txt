Introduction
#############

More secure programming is on the rise, eliminating more generic program
exploitation vectors, such as stack-based overflows, heap overflows and symlink
bugs.  Despite this, subtle vulnerabilities are often overlooked during code
audits, leaving so-called "secure" applications vulnerable to attack, but in a
less obvious manner.  Secure design of signal-handlers is often not considered,
but I believe that this class of security holes deserves just as much attention
as more generic classes of bugs, such as buffer overflow bugs.

This paper intends to discuss problems faced when writing signal-handling
routines, how to exploit the problems, and presents ideas of how to avoid such
issues.  A working knowledge of the C programming language and UNIX-like
operating systems would benefit the reader greatly, but is certainly not
essential.



Signal Handling: An Overview
#############################

To understand what signal handlers are, one must first know what exactly a
signal is.  In brief, signals are notifications delivered to a process to alert
the given process about "important" events concerning itself.  For example,
users of an application can send signals using common keyboard Ctrl
combinations, such as Ctrl-C - which will send a SIGINT signal to the given
process.

Many different signals exist, but some of the more common (or useful) ones are:
SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGKILL, SIGABRT, SIGTERM and SIGPIPE.  Many more exist,
however.  Below is a complete-ish list of available signals, according to the
POSIX.1 standard, along with a basic description of their purpose.

The above signal explanations have been extracted from the signal(7) man page
documentation.

Although the above list is quite complete regarding signals accepted in the
POSIX standards, other signals are available to programmers according to "SUSv2
and SUSv3 / POSIX 1003.1-2001".

When a process receives a signal documented in the list above, the default 
action is taken, stated in "Action".  However, this doesn't have to be how the 
application reacts when a given signal is received - how the process handles the 
signal when it receives it is entirely the choice of the programmer - this is 
where signal handlers come in.

It is worth noting that the signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be handled,
ignored or blocked.  One can generally assume this is because a user must have a 
way of terminating a process, should the program go awfully awry.

"What are signal handlers", one might ask.  The simple answer is that signal
handlers are small routines which are typically called when a pre-defined
signal, or set of signals, is delivered to the process it is running under
before the end of program execution - after execution flow has been directed to
a signal handling function, all instructions within the handler are executed in
turn.  In larger applications, however, signal handling routines are often
written to complete a more complex set of tasks to ensure clean termination of
the program, such as; unlinking of tempory files, freeing of memory buffers,
appending log messages, and freeing file descriptors and/or sockets.  Signal
handlers are generally defined as ordinary program functions, and are then
defined as the default handler for a certain signal usually near to the
beginning of the program.

Consider the sample program below:

--- sigint.c ---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void sighndlr() {
        printf("Ctrl-C caught!\n");
        exit(0);
}

int main() {
        signal(SIGINT, sighndlr);

        while(1)
                sleep(1);


        /* should never reach here */
        return(0);
}
--- EOF ---

'sigint.c' specifies that the function 'sighndlr' should be given control of
execution flow when a SIGINT signal is received by the program.  The program
sleeps "forever", or until a SIGINT signal is received - in which case the
"Ctrl-C caught!" message is printed to the terminal - as seen below:

--- output ---
[root@localhost shaun]# gcc test.c -o test
[root@localhost shaun]# ./test
[... program sleeps ...]
Ctrl-C caught!
[root@localhost shaun]#
--- EOF ---


Generally speaking, a SIGINT signal is delivered when a user hits the Ctrl-C
combination at the keyboard, but a SIGINT signal can be generated by the kill(1) 
utility.

However simple or complex the signal handler is, there are several potential
pitfalls which must be avoided during the development of the handler.  Although 
a signal handler may look "safe", problems may still arise, but may be 
less-obvious to the unsuspecting eye.  There are two main classes of problems
when dealing with signal-handler development - non-atomic process modifications, 
and non-reentrant code, both of which are potentially critical to system 
security.



Non-atomic Modifications
#########################

Since signals can be delivered at almost any moment, and privileges often need 
to be maintained (i.e root privileges in a SUID root application) for obvious 
reasons (i.e for access to raw sockets, graphical resources, etc), signal 
handling routines need to be written with extra care.  If they are not, and 
special privileges are held by the process at the particular time of signal 
delivery, things could begin to go wrong very quickly.  What is meant by 
'non-atomic' is that the change in the program isn't permanant - it will just be 
in place temporarily.  To illustrate this, we will discuss a sample vulnerable 
program.

Consider the following sample program:

--- atomicvuln.c ---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void sighndlr() {
        printf("Ctrl-C caught!\n");
        printf("UID: %d\n", getuid());
        /* other cleanup code... */
}

int showuid() {
        printf("UID: %d\n", getuid());
        return(0);
}


int main() {
        int origuid = getuid();
        signal(SIGINT, sighndlr);


        setuid(0);
        sleep(5);

        setuid(origuid);

        showuid();
        return(0);
}
--- EOF ---

The above program should immediately spark up any security concious programmer's 
paranoia, but the insecurity isn't immediately obvious to everyone.  As we can 
see from above, a signal handler is declared for 'SIGINT', and the program gives 
itself root privileges (so to speak).  After a delay of around five seconds, the 
privileges are revoked, and the program is exited with success.  However, if a 
SIGINT signal is received, execution is directed to the SIGINT handler, 
'sighdlr()'.

Let's look at some sample outputs:

--- output ---
[root@localhost shaun]# gcc test.c -o test
[root@localhost shaun]# chmod +s test
[root@localhost shaun]# exit
exit
[shaun@localhost shaun]$ ./test
[... program sleeps 5 seconds ...]
UID: 502
[shaun@localhost shaun]$ ./test
[... CTRL-C is typed ...]
Ctrl-C caught!
UID: 0
UID: 502
[shaun@localhost shaun]$
--- EOF ---

If you hadn't spotted the insecurity in 'atomicvuln.c' yet, the above output 
should make things obvious; since the signal handling routine, 'sighdlr()', was 
called when root privileges were still possessed, the friendly printf() 
statements kindly tell us that our privileges are root (assuming the binary is 
SUID root).  And just to prove our theory, if we simply allow the program to 
sleep for 5 seconds without sending an interrupt, the printf() statement kindly 
tells us that our UID is 502 - my actual UID - as seen above.

With this, it is easy to understand where the flaw lies; if program execution 
can be interrupted between the time when superuser privileges are given, and the 
time when superuser privileges are revoked, the signal handling code *will* be 
ran with root privileges.  Just imagine - if the signal handling routine 
included potentially sensitive code, compromisation of root privileges could
occur.

Although the sample program isn't an example of privilege escalation, it at 
least demonstrates how non-atomic modifications can present security issues when 
signal handling is involved.  And do not assume that code similar to the sample 
program above isn't found in popular security critical applications in 
wide-spread use - it is.  An example of vulnerable code similar to that of above 
which is an application in wide-spread use, see [1] in the bibliography.


Non-reentrant Code
###################

Although it may not be obvious (and it's not), some glibc functions just weren't 
designed to be reentered due to receipt of a signal, thus causing potential 
problems for signal handlers which use them.  An example of such a function is 
the 'free()' function.  According to 'free()'s man page, free()

"frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must  have  been
 returned by a previous call to malloc(), calloc() or realloc().  Other-
 wise, or  if  free(ptr)  has  already  been  called  before,  undefined
 behaviour occurs.  If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed."

As the man page snippet claims, free() can only be used to release memory which 
was allocated using 'malloc()', else "undefined behavior" occurs.  More 
specifically, or in usual cases, the heap is corrupted, if free() is called on a 
memory area which has already been free()d.  Because of this implementation 
design, reentrant signal routines which use 'free()' can be attacked.

Consider the below sample vulnerable program:

--- reentry.c ---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <syslog.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void *data1, *data2;
char *logdata;

void sighdlr() {
        printf("Entered sighdlr()...\n");
        syslog(LOG_NOTICE,"%s\n", logdata);
        free(data2);
        free(data1);
        sleep(10);
        exit(0);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
          logdata = argv[1];
          data1 = strdup(argv[2]);
          data2 = malloc(340);
          signal(SIGHUP, sighdlr);
          signal(SIGTERM, sighdlr);
          sleep(10);

          /* should never reach here */
          return(0);

}
--- EOF ---

The above program defines a signal handler which frees allocated heap memory, 
and sleeps for around 10 seconds.  However, once the signal handler has been 
entered, signals are not blocked, and thus can still be freely delivered.  As we 
learnt above, a duplicate call of free() on an already free()d memory area will 
result in "undefined behavior" - possibly corruption of the heap memory.  As we 
can see, user-defined data is taken, and syslog() is also called from the sig 
handler function - but how does syslog() work?

'syslog()' creates a memory buffer stream, using two malloc() invokations - the 
first one allocates a 'stream description structure', whilst the other creates a 
buffer suitable for the actual syslog message data.  This basis is essentially 
used to maintain a tempory copy of the syslog message.

But why can this cause problems in context of co-usage of non-reentrant 
routines?  To find the answer, let's experiment a little, by attempting to 
exploit the above program, which happens to be vulnerable.

Interesting.  As we can see above, our large string of 'a's has found its way
into several program registers on stack - EAX and EDI.  From this, we can assume 
we are witnessing the "undefined behavior" we discussed earlier, when the signal 
handler is reentered.

When the sample vulnerable program receives the second
signal (SIGTERM), since signals are not being ignored, the signal handler is
reentered to handle this second signal, causing something to go very wrong.
But why is this happening?

Since the second memory region (*data2) was free()d during the first entry of
the signal handler, syslog() re-uses this released memory for its own purposes - 
storing its syslog message, because as the short syslog() explanation above 
stated, two malloc() calls are present in most syslog() implementations, and 
thus it re-uses the newly free()d memory - *data2.  After the usage of the 
memory once held as data2 by syslog(), a second 'free()' call is made on the 
memory region, because of reentry of the signal handler function.  As the 
free(3) man page stated, undefined behavior *will* occur if the memory area was 
already free()d, and we happen to know that this was the case.  So when 'free()' 
was called again on *data2, free() landed somewhere in the area containing the 
'a's (hence 0x61 in hex), because syslog() had re-used the freed area to store 
the syslog message, temporarily.

As the GDB output above illustrates, as long as user-input is used by 'syslog()' 
(and it is in this case), we have some control over the program registers, when 
this "undefined behavior" (corruption of heap in most cases) occurs.  Because of 
this ability, exploitation is most likely a possibility - it is left as an 
exercise to the reader to play with this sample vulnerable program a little 
more, and determine if the vulnerability is exploitable.


For the interested reader, 'free()' is not the only non-reentrant glibc 
function.  In general, it can be assumed that all glibc functions which are NOT 
included within the following list are non-reentrant, and thus are not safe to
be used in signal handlers.

Secure Signal Handling
#######################

In general, signal handling vulnerabilities can be prevented by

--

1) Using only reentrant glibc functions within signal handlers -

This safe-guards against the possibility of "undefined behavior" or otherwise as 
presented in the above example.  However, this isn't *always* feasible, 
especially when a programmers needs to accomplish tasks such as freeing memory.

Other counter-measures, in this case, can protect against this.  See below.

2) ignoring signals during signal handling routines -

As the obvious suggests, this programming practice will indefinately prevent
handling of signals during the execution of signal handling routines, thus
preventing signal handler reentry.

Consider the following signal handler template:

--- sighdlr.c ---
void sighdlr() {
signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGABRT, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN);
/* ...ignore other signals ... */

/* cleanup code here */

exit(0);
}
--- EOF ---

As we can see above, signals are blocked before doing anything else in the
signal handling routine.  This guarantees against signal handler reentry (or
almost does).

3) Ignoring signals whilst non-atomic process modifications are in place -

This involves blocking signals, in a similar way to the above code snippet,
during the execution of code with non-atomic modifications in place, such as
code execution with superuser privileges.

Consider the following code snippet:

--- nonatomicblock.c ---
/* code exec with non-atomic process modifications starts here... */
signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGABRT, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN);
/* block other signals if desired... */

setuid(0);
/* sensitive code here */

setuid(getuid());
/* sensitive code ends here */

signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL);
signal(SIGABRT, SIG_DFL);
signal(SIGHUP, SIG_DFL);

/* ...code here... */
--- EOF ---

Before executing privileged code, signals are blocked.  After execution of the
privileged code, privileges are dropped, and the signal action is set back to
the default action.


There are probably more ways of preventing signal vulnerabilities, but the three 
above should be enough to implement semi-safe signal handlers.



Conclusion
###########

I hope this paper has at least touched upon possible problems encountered when
dealing with signals in C applications.  If nothing else can be taken away from
this paper, my aim is to have outlined that secure programming practices should
always be applied when implementing signal handlers.  Full stop.  Remember this.
