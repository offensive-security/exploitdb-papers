                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                June 20, 1989


     Greetings and welcome to Issue 27 of Phrack Inc.  The pressure is on with
SummerCon '89 just a couple short days away.  We're sorry it has taken so long
to get this issue out, but summer break has created more responsibilities and
busy schedules than we have ever had to deal with while in school.  Still, I
think you will agree that this issue was worth the wait.

     This issue we feature a new updated NUA and Datex-P list from Oberdaemon
of Switzerland and Chapter 7 of the Future Transcendent Saga (taking into
account that the SPAN and NSFnet files were chapters 5 and 6).  We also present
the second part of the COSMOS file written by King Arthur.

     Before we get to the main contents of the issue, we have a few comments to
make regarding security and Phrack Inc.'s Internet access;

     Thanks to a friend, we at Phrack Inc. have become aware of one of the main
techniques that the National Security Agency (NSA) uses to perform surveillance
on the wide area networks.

     In certain messages that certain government agencies distribute, special
phone numbers are included; WATS (800) numbers, to be more specific.  As these
messages are distributed around the continent via various netmail and file
transfer schemes, they are passed through several surveillance stations.  All
of their stations perform one function, and in Unix terms, that function is
called "grep."

     Grep stands for G>lobal R>egular E>xpression search and P>rint.  The grep
does simple string matching.  Every instance of these special 800-numbers in an
email message (or batch of them) is flagged, recorded, and the record is mailed
to certain intelligence agencies by the surveillance stations.

     Here are the networks that we are reasonably certain that this practice is
performed on:

* USEnet  : Email is only checked in certain places, but ALL netnews (including
            alt and any other nonstandard newsgroups) are flagged by a single
            government domain SUN-3 that shall remain nameless.
* ARPAnet : All mail going through a standard BBN (Bolt, Bernack, and
            Neumann... a Cambridge/MIT spinoff) Internet controller will be
            flagged, but the only information recorded by the controller is the
            source and destination TCP/IP addresses of the message.  But when
            you consider that this involves ***ALL*** DARPA mailing lists, you
            get a visualization of the magnitude.  The reason more complex
            information is NOT recorded is that this network is the only
            AUTHORIZED place that these messages with the hot WATS are supposed
            to appear.  You will see what this means in a moment.
* BITnet  : Large IBM mainframe with I/O channel cycles to spare should have no
            problem scanning mail from one of the most publically accessable
            "free" networks.
* Fidonet : The Secret Service scans this for credit card and other violations.
            It is not too hard for them to check for the (800)'s, too.
* W.Union : All international telex lines are scanned to match a whole lot of
            stuff, especially drug-related information.  The phone numbers are
            on their list.

     We have other suspicions, but we are withholding them for now.

     The other news is equally disturbing because it strikes us a little close
to home.  We are temporarily losing our network access.  As of June 27, 1989
through August 28, 1989 we will not have access to our accounts on UMCVMB
mainframe system.  Make no attempt to mail us to our addresses there until
August 28, 1989.  However, every cloud has a silver lining and this is no
exception.  For networks people who wish to submit files to Phrack Inc. during
this time period we proudly present our friend and associate, Hatchet Molly.
He can be reached at "TK0GRM2@NIU.BITNET" and/or

     So here is to another great issue of Phrack Inc!

                          Operating the IBM VM/SP CP

             (IBM Virtual Machine System Product Control Program)

                     An information article researched by

                                  Taran King

                                 May 18, 1989


This article is for the purpose of understanding the Control Program (CP)
portion of IBM's VM/SP.  This is basically a separate section of VM/CMS known
as CP (with full screen editors, the CP level is indicated in the lower right
hand corner of the screen and for line-by-line editors, before the command line
and after hitting carriage returns, it should say "CP") and it's purpose is to
manage real resources.  Any command that involves something outside of your
virtual machine must communicate with CP.  If CMS does not recognize a command
you give it, it will give it to CP.

The user generally enters the CP stage after a program flops or if you get
disconnected.  You can also enter the CP stage by hitting PA1 which is a
function key of sorts.  PA1 toggles between CP and CMS while on-line and if you
re-login after being disconnected, PA1 can be used besides the BEGIN command
which will be spoken about later in this article.

Generally, VM/CMS systems are well equipped with help files so if anything I
print becomes unclear to you, from CMS mode, type HELP CP XXX where XXX is the
CP command you want information on.

To start this article off, I'm printing off the IBM-Defined Class and the
Function Types as listed in the IBM VM/SP CP manual.  This essentially tells
you what privileges you have with your assigned class.

IBM-Defined      Function         User &
   Class           Type          Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~~        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     A               O           Operations:  The primary sysop can issue all
                                 class A commands.  The class A user controls
                                 the VM/SP system.  Class A is assigned to the
                                 user at the VM/SP system console during IPL.
                                 The primary sysop is responsible for the
                                 availability of the VM/SP system and its
                                 communication lines and resources.  In
                                 addition, the class A user controls system
                                 accounting, broadcast messages, virtual
                                 machine performance options, and other
                                 command operands that affect the overall
                                 performance of the VM/SP.  The sysop controls
                                 operation of the real machine using the
                                 system control panel and console device.
                                 NOTE:  The class A sysop who is automatically
                                 logged on during CP initialization is
                                 designated as the primary sysop.

     B               R           Resource:  The system resource operator can
                                 issue all class B commands.  The class B user
                                 controls allocation and deallocation of all
                                 the real resources of the VM/SP system,
                                 except those controlled by the primary sysop
                                 and spooling operator.

     C               P           Programmer:  The system programmer can issue
                                 all class C commands.  The class C user
                                 updates certain functions of the VM/SP
                                 system.  The system programmer can modify
                                 real storage in the real machine.

     D               S           Spooling:  The spooling operator can issue
                                 all class D commands.  The class D user
                                 controls spool data files and specific
                                 functions of the system's unit record
                                 equipment.

     E               A           Analyst:  The system analyst can issue all
                                 class E commands.  The class E user displays
                                 the contents of real storage, performs the
                                 functions required to generate saved systems
                                 and discontiguous saved segments, and
                                 controls the collecting and recording of
                                 performance measurement data.  This class of
                                 user can display specified real storage areas
                                 on the virtual operator's console or on a
                                 spooled virtual printer, but cannot modify
                                 real storage.

     F               C           Customer Engineer:  The service
                                 representative can issue all class F
                                 commands.  The class F user obtains, and
                                 examines, in detail, certain data about input
                                 and output devices connected to the VM/SP
                                 system.  The service representative can
                                 establish extensive recording mode for one
                                 I/O device at a time and can cause the
                                 recording of repressible machine check errors
                                 to be initiated or resumed.

     G               G           General:  The general user can issue all
                                 class G commands.  The class G user controls
                                 functions associated with the execution of
                                 his virtual machine.  A general user cannot
                                 display or modify real storage.

    ANY             ANY          The ANY classification is given to certain CP
                                 commands that are available to any user.
                                 These are primarily for the purpose of
                                 gaining and relinquishing access to the VM/SP
                                 system.

The following is the list of commands available along with a brief description
as to what they do and/or formatting and then ending with the IBM-Defined
Class and Function Type.

* : From CP, one may use the * command to annotate the terminal console sheet
~   or the terminal display screen with a comment.  In other words, type * and
then any string of characters you would, for some reason, to be present on the
screen thereafter.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  N/A

#CP : This command is used to execute a CP Command while in a virtual machine
~~~   command environment without first signaling attention to get to the CP
command environment which means that when typing P <command> to perform a CP
operation, CP directly receives the command whereas CP <command> merely queues
the command from CP.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  ANY

ACNT : The ACNT command is used to create accounting records for logged on
~~~~   users and to reset accounting data.  It also closes a spool file that
is accumulating accounting records.
Privilege Class:  A
Function Type:  O

ADSTOP : The ADSTOP command is used to halt the execution of a virtual machine
~~~~~~   at a virtual instruction point.  The hexloc variable may be placed
after the word ADSTOP which is a 6 character hexadecimal representation of the
virtual instruction address where the execution is to be halted.  The OFF
option of the ADSTOP command cancels any previous ADSTOP setting.
Privilege Class:  G
Function Type:  G

ATTN : Use the ATTN command to make an attention interruption pending at your
~~~~   virtual console.
Privilege Class:  G
Function Type:  G

AUTOLOG : This command allows the user to log on any virtual machine defined
~~~~~~~   in the directory.
Privilege Level:  A, B
Function Type:  O

BACKSPAC : The BACKSPAC command is used to restart or reposition the current
~~~~~~~~   output on a real punch or printer.
Privilege Class:  D
Function Type:  S

BEGIN or B : The BEGIN command by itself from CP mode will return the user to
~~~~~~~~~~   CMS mode in the place where he/she left off before he/she was
disconnected or thrown into CP.  The BEGIN command can also be followed by a
hex location as to where to start in the case of the user wanting to be doing
something other than what was previously occurring.
Privilege Class:  G
Function Type:  G

CHANGE or CH : In use of the CHANGE command, there are subcommands with
~~~~~~~~~~~~   variables.  Generally, the "name" variable is 1 to 4 characters
in length.  The following are the subcommands with functions and formatting:

  o  READER or RDR : changes reader spool files.
  o  PRINTER or PRT : changes printer spool files.
  o  PUNCH or PCH : changes punch spool files.

  o  FORM form1 : 1 to 8 character alphanumeric form name used to select files
                  to be changed (form1).
  o  ALL : changes all of your spool files.
  o  HOLD : prevents a file from being printed, punched, or read until
            released.
  o  NOHOLD : releases the specified file from the user's HOLD status.
  o  DIST dist : changes the distribution code to variable "dist".
  o  COPY(*)nnn : specifies number of copies of the file you want spooled,
                  which is valid only for printer or punch files.  "nnn" is a
                  number from 1 to 255 and the "*" is  present in the case of
                  a 3800 printer being used so that copies will be made in the
                  printer internally.
  o  FLASH name nnn : signifies that a form's overlay contained in the 3800
                      printer is to be superimposed onto certain pages of
                      output.  "nnn" is a number from 0 to 255 representing
                      the number of copies to be superimposed.
  o  MODIFY name (n) : allows text alteration by preventing information
                       printing or by adding labels to output.  "n" selects a
                       keyword in CHARS to be used for copy modification text.

  o  FCB name : controls vertical spacing of output on a page.
  o  FORM form2 : changes spool form name of file to form2.
  o  NAME fn (ft) : assigns identification to spool file in CMS format
                    filename and filetype.
  o  NAME dsname : assigns identification to spool file in non-CMS format
                   where "dsname" is from 1 to 24 characters, suitable for
                   specifying OS or DOS files.
Privilege Class:  S, G
Function Type:  D, G

CLOSE or C : The CLOSE command terminates spooling activity on any virtual
~~~~~~~~~~   spooled unit record or console device.  It Contains the following
subcommands to be followed by the letter C or the word CLOSE:

   o  READER or RDR
   o  PRINTER or PRT
   o  PUNCH or PCH
   o  FORM form1
   o  HOLD
   o  NOHOLD
   o  DIST dist
   o  NAME fn (ft)
   o  NAME dsname
   o  vaddr : virtual address (cuu) of device to be closed.
   o  CONSOLE : closes virtual machine's console spool file which makes it a
                printer spool file.
   o  PURGE : closes and immediately purges from the virtual machine the
              output spool files.  No output file is produced.
   o  CHAIN : only valid for VM/SP HPO Release 4.2 and Profs Spool File
              Enhancement PRPQ.  Indicates that the punchfile is to be
              chained.
Privilege Class:  G
Function Type:  G

COMMANDS or COMM : Use COMMAND to list the commands and diagnose codes you are
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   authorized to use.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  ANY

COUPLE : Using the COUPLE command connects your virtual non-dedicated
~~~~~~   channel-to-channel device to another user's virtual device of the
same type or to another one of your own virtual devices of the same type.  The
format of this command is in the form of COUPLE vaddr1 TO userid vaddr2.  The
variable vaddr1 is your virtual address and the variables userid vaddr2
identify the userid and virtual address of that userid to be connected to.
Privilege Class:  G
Function Type:  G

CP : The CP command may precede the command to be processed, but it is not
~~   necessary.  Generally, the CP command is used from CMS mode to queue CP
functions by typing CP <command>.

CPTRAP : The CPTRAP command creates a reader file of a selected trace table,
~~~~~~   CP interface, and virtual machine interface entries for problem
determination.
Privilege Class:  C
Function Type:  P

DCP : This command displays the contents of real storage locations at the
~~~   terminal.
Privilege Class:  C, E
Function Type:  P

DEFINE or DEF : The DEFINE command in CP is used to alter your virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~   configuration or channel operating mode.  There are a LOT of
subcommands that are used with the DEFINE command such as RDR or PRT or PCH
and the list goes on and on.  If you want details, there is a help file (type
HELP CP DEF) that is almost 600 lines that goes into detail on each
subcommand.
Privilege Class:  B, G
Function Type:  R, G

DETACH or DET : The DETACH command is used to remove a virtual device from the
~~~~~~~~~~~~~   virtual machine.  The subcommands are as follows:

  o  vaddr (vaddr...) : used for multiple addresses to be detached where vaddr
                        is the virtual address (cuu) of the device to be
                        detached.
  o  vaddr-vaddr : used to detach a range of addresses.
  o  CHANNEL c : detaches the real address of the channel.
Privilege Class:  B, G
Function Type:  R, G

DIAL : Using the DIAL command logically connects a switched line, leased line,
~~~~   locally attached, or remote Binary Synchronous (BSC) terminal to a
previously logged-on multiple-access virtual machine.  It is in the format of
DIAL userid (vaddr) where the userid is that to be connected to and the
vaddr is the optional virtual address.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  ANY

DISABLE : The DISABLE command prevents low speed communications lines from
~~~~~~~   accessing the system.
Privilege Class:  A, B
Function Type:  R

DISCONN or DISC : The DISCONNECT command is used to disconnect your terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   from the system while the virtual machine continues

communications line is not to be disabled which allows you to avoid re-dialing
the system.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  ANY

DISPLAY or D : The DISPLAY command allows you to display virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~   components at your terminal.  Depending on what variable
follows the D or DISPLAY command from CP, you can display virtual storage
locations, storage keys, general registers, floating-point registers, control
registers, vector registers, VAC (Vector Activity Counter), VSR (Vector Status
Register), VMR (Vector Mask Register), PSW (Program Status Word), CAW (Channel
Address Word), and CSW (Channel Status Word).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   identify yourself to the system and to access that
system.  Following the words LOGIN or LOGON or L, type your userid which is
the identifier assigned to you in the system.  If the system you are logging
onto does NOT have password suppression, your password can follow directly
after your userid.  NOTE:  If the system you are on does have password
suppression (i.e.  it does not echo to your screen what you type when you type
your password), you will get a system error message if you try to put it on
the same line as your userid.  The NOIPL option, which would follow your
password and userid, specifies that the IPL device or name in the directory
should not be used for an automatic IPL.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  ANY

MESSAGE or MSG or M : Use the MESSAGE command to transmit message text to a

option which purges all of the above mentioned files.
Privilege Class:  D, G
Function Type:  S, G

QUERY or Q : Also available in CMS mode, the QUERY command is used to
~~~~~~~~~~   determine your system status and machine configuration.
Although there are far too many subcommands of the QUERY command, the
following is a list of items that may be queried.  I recommend, for full

However, the SCREEN command is only valid when the Extended Color Feature has
been applied to the terminal controller.

You can assign extended color and extended highlighting values to six distinct
display screen areas:  the input area, the system status area, and the output
area that encompasses three other areas: CP output, virtual machine output,
virtual machine output, and an input redisplay area.  The physical attributes
of 3270 Information Display station screens vary according to model.

Because this command mainly applies to people who are not on dial-up, I have
elected not to detail all of the variables available with the SCREEN command.
Once again, I recommend you using HELP CP SCREEN for details.

This article is far from totally complete as far as in-depthness goes.  As I
have stated in numerous portions of this file, the VM/CMS system has a very
good HELP file system, and from CMS, the command HELP CP <command> will, in
most cases, allow you to read a relatively clear text file containing the
details and usage specifications of these commands.  I hope that, should you be
moving around a VM/CMS system, this file will assist you in the CP mode.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MIDNET is a regional computer network that is part of the NSFnet, the National
Science Foundation Network.  Currently, eleven mid-United States universities
are connected to each other and to the NSFnet via MIDnet:

UA  - University of Arkansas at Fayetteville
ISU - Iowa State University at Ames
UI  - University of Iowa at Iowa City
KSU - Kansas State University at Manhattan
KU  - University of Kansas at Lawrence
UMC - University of Missouri at Columbia
WU  - Washington University at St. Louis, Missouri
UNL - University of Nebraska at Lincoln
OSU - Oklahoma State University at Stillwater
UT  - University of Tulsa (Oklahoma)
OU  - University of Oklahoma at Norman

Researchers at any of these universities that have funded grants can access the
six supercomputer centers funded by the NSF:

John Von Neuman Supercomputer Center
National Center for Atmospheric Research
Cornell National Supercomputer Facility
National Center for Supercomputing Applications
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
San Diego Supercomputing Center

In addition, researchers and scientists can communicate with each other over a
vast world-wide computer network that includes the NSFnet, ARPAnet, CSnet,
BITnet, and others that you have read about in The Future Transcendent Saga.
Please refer to "Frontiers" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, File 4 of 13)
for more details.

MIDnet is just one of several regional computer networks that comprise the
NSFnet system.  Although all of these regional computer networks work the same,
MIDnet is the only one that I have direct access to and so this file is written
from a MIDnet point of view.  For people who have access to the other regional
networks of NSFnet, the only real differences depicted in this file that would
not apply to the other regional networks are the universities that are served
by MIDnet as opposed to:

NYSERnet  in New York State
SURAnet   in the southeastern United States
SEQSUInet in Texas
BARRnet   in the San Francisco area
MERIT     in Michigan

           (There are others that are currently being constructed.)

These regional networks all hook into the NSFnet backbone, which is a network
that connects the six supercomputer centers.  For example, a person at Kansas
State University can connect with a supercomputer via MIDnet and the NSFnet
backbone.  That researcher can also send mail to colleagues at the University
of Delaware by using MIDnet, NSFnet and SURAnet.  Each university has its own
local computer network which connects on-campus computers as well as providing
a means to connecting to a regional network.

Some universities are already connected to older networks such as CSnet, the
ARPAnet and BITnet.  In principal, any campus connected to any of these
networks can access anyone else in any other network since there are gateways
between the networks.

Gateways are specialized computers that forward network traffic, thereby
connecting networks.  In practice, these wide-area networks use different
networking technology which make it impossible to provide full functionality
across the gateways.  However, mail is almost universally supported across all
gateways, so that a person at a BITnet site can send mail messages to a
colleague at an ARPAnet site (or anywhere else for that matter).  You should
already be somewhat familiar with this, but if not refer to;

"Limbo To Infinity" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, File 3 of 13) and
"Internet Domains" (Phrack Inc., Volume Three, Issue 26, File 8 of 11)

Computer networks rely on hardware and software that allow computers to
communicate.  The language that enables network communication is called a
protocol.  There are many different protocols in use today.  MIDnet uses the
TCP/IP protocols, also known as the DOD (Department of Defense) Protocol Suite.

Other networks that use TCP/IP include ARPAnet, CSnet and the NSFnet.  In fact,
all the regional networks that are linked to the NSFnet backbone are required
to use TCP/IP.  At the local campus level, TCP/IP is often used, although other
protocols such as IBM's SNA and DEC's DECnet are common.  In order to
communicate with a computer via  MIDnet and the NSFnet, a computer at a campus
must use TCP/IP directly or use a gateway that will translate its protocols
into TCP/IP.

The Internet is a world-wide computer network that is the conglomeration of
most of the large wide area networks, including ARPAnet, CSnet, NSFnet, and the
regionals, such as MIDnet.  To a lesser degree, other networks such as BITnet
that can send mail to hosts on these networks are included as part of the
Internet.  This huge network of networks, the Internet, as you have by now read
all about in the pages of Phrack Inc., is a rapidly growing and very complex
entity that allows sophisticated communication between scientists, students,
government officials and others.  Being a part of this community is both
exciting and challenging.

This chapter of the Future Transcendent Saga gives a general description of the
protocols and software used in MIDnet and the NSFNet.  A discussion of several
of the more commonly used networking tools is also included to enable you to
make practical use of the network as soon as possible.


The DOD Protocol Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOD Protocol Suite includes many different protocols.  Each protocol is a
specification of how communication is to occur between computers.  Computer
hardware and software vendors use the protocol to create programs and sometimes
specialized hardware in order to implement the network function intended by the
protocol.  Different implementations of the same protocol exist for the varied
hardware and operating systems found in a network.

The three most commonly used network functions are:

Mail          -- Sending and receiving messages
File Transfer -- Sending and receiving files
Remote Login  -- Logging into a distant computer

Of these, mail is probably the most commonly used.

In the TCP/IP world, there are three different protocols that realize these
functions:

SMTP   -- (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Mail
FTP    -- (File Transfer Protocol) sending and receiving files
Telnet -- Remote login

How to use these protocols is discussed in the next section.  At first glance,
it is not obvious why these three functions are the most common.  After all,
mail and file transfer seem to be the same thing.  However, mail messages are
not identical to files, since they are usually comprised of only ASCII
characters and are sequential in structure.  Files may contain binary data and
have complicated, non-sequential structures.  Also, mail messages can usually
tolerate some errors in transmission whereas files should not contain any
errors.  Finally, file transfers usually occur in a secure setting (i.e. The
users who are transferring files know each other's names and passwords and are
permitted to transfer the file, whereas mail can be sent to anybody as long as
their name is known).

While mail and transfer accomplish the transfer of raw information from one
computer to another, Telnet allows a distant user to process that information,
either by logging in to a remote computer or by linking to another terminal.
Telnet is most often used to remotely log in to a distant computer, but it is
actually a general-purpose communications protocol.  I have found it incredibly
useful over the last year.  In some ways, it could be used for a great deal of
access because you can directly connect to another computer anywhere that has
TCP/IP capabilities, however please note that Telnet is *NOT* Telenet.

There are other functions that some networks provide, including the following:

- Name to address translation for networks, computers and people
- The current time
- Quote of the day or fortune
- Printing on a remote printer, or use of any other remote peripheral
- Submission of batch jobs for non-interactive execution
- Dialogues and conferencing between multiple users
- Remote procedure call (i.e. Distributing program execution over several
                              remote computers)
- Transmission of voice or video information

Some of these functions are still in the experimental stages and require faster
computer networks than currently exist.  In the future, new functions will
undoubtedly be invented and existing ones improved.

The DOD Protocol Suite is a layered network architecture, which means that
network functions are performed by different programs that work independently
and in harmony with each other.  Not only are there different programs but
there are different protocols.  The protocols SMTP, FTP and Telnet are
described above.  Protocols have been defined for getting the current time, the
quote of the day, and for translating names.  These protocols are called
applications protocols because users directly interact with the programs that
implement these protocols.

The Transmission Control Protocol, TCP, is used by many of the application
protocols.  Users almost never interact with TCP directly.  TCP establishes a
reliable end-to-end connection between two processes on remote computers.  Data
is sent through a network in small chunks called packets to improve reliability
and performance.  TCP ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors.
If a packet does have errors, TCP requests that the packet be retransmitted.

In turn, TCP calls upon IP, Internet Protocol, to move the data from one
network to another.  IP is still not the lowest layer of the architecture,
since there is usually a "data link layer protocol" below it.  This can be any
of a number of different protocols, two very common ones being X.25 and
Ethernet.

FTP, Telnet and SMTP are called "application protocols", since they are
directly used by applications programs that enable users to make use of the
network.  Network applications are the actual programs that implement these
protocols and provide an interface between the user and the computer.  An
implementation of a network protocol is a program or package of programs that
provides the desired network function such as file transfer.  Since computers
differ from vendor to vendor (e.g. IBM, DEC, CDC), each computer must have its
own implementation of these protocols.  However, the protocols are standardized
so that computers can interoperate over the network (i.e. Can understand and
process each other's data).  For example, a TCP packet generated by an IBM
computer can be read and processed by a DEC computer.

In many instances, network applications programs use the name of the protocol.
For example, the program that transfers files may be called "FTP" and the
program that allows remote logins may be called "Telnet."  Sometimes these
protocols are incorporated into larger packages, as is common with SMTP.  Many
computers have mail programs that allow users on the same computer to send mail
to each other.  SMTP functions are often added to these mail programs so that
users can also send and receive mail through a network.  In such cases, there
is no separate program called SMTP that the user can access, since the mail
program provides the user interface to this network function.

Specific implementation of network protocols, such as FTP, are tailored to the
computer hardware and operating system on which they are used.  Therefore, the
exact user interface varies from one implementation to another.  For example,
the FTP protocol specifies a set of FTP commands which each FTP implementation
must understand and process.  However, these are usually placed at a low level,
often invisible to the user, who is given a higher set of commands to use.

These higher-level commands are not standardized so they may vary from one
implementation of FTP to another.  For some operating systems, not all of these
commands make equal sense, such as "Change Directory," or may have different
meanings.  Therefore the specific user interface that the user sees will
probably differ.

This file describes a generic implementation of the standard TCP/IP application
protocols.  Users must consult local documentation for specifics at their
sites.


Names and Addresses In A Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In DOD Protocol Suite, each network is given a unique identifying number.  This
number is assigned by a central authority, namely the Network Information
Center run by SRI, abbreviated as SRI-NIC, in order to prevent more than one
network from having the same network number.  For example, the ARPAnet has
network number 10 while MIDnet has a longer number, namely 128.242.

Each host in a network has a unique identification so other hosts can specify
them unambiguously.  Host numbers are usually assigned by the organization that
manages the network, rather than one central authority.  Host numbers do not
need to be unique throughout the whole Internet but two hosts on the same
network need to have unique host numbers.

The combination of the network number and the host number is called the IP
address of the host and is specified as a 32-bit binary number.  All IP
addresses in the Internet are expressible as 32-bit numbers, although they are
often written in dotted decimal notation.  Dotted decimal notation breaks the
32-bit number into four eight-bit parts or octets and each octet is specified
as a decimal number.  For example, 00000001 is the binary octet that specifies
the decimal number 1, while 11000000 specifies 192.  Dotted decimal notation
makes IP addresses much easier to read and remember.

Computers in the Internet are also identified by hostnames, which are strings
of characters, such as "phrackvax."  However, IP packets must specify the
32-bit IP address instead of the hostname so  some way to translating hostnames
to IP addresses must exist.

One way is to have a table of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses,
called a hosttable.  Nearly every TCP/IP implementation has such a hosttable,
although the weaknesses of this method are forcing a shift to a new scheme
called the domain name system.  In UNIX systems, the hosttable is often called
"/etc/hosts."  You can usually read this file and find out what the IP
addresses of various hosts are.  Other systems may call this file by a
different name and make it unavailable for public viewing.

Users of computers are generally given accounts to which all charges for
computer use are billed.  Even if computer time is free at an installation,
accounts are used to distinguish between the users and enforce file
protections.  The generic term "username" will be used in this file to refer to
the name by which the computer account is accessed.

In the early days of the ARPAnet which was the first network to use the TCP/IP
protocols, computer users were identified by their username, followed by a
commercial "at" sign (@), followed by the hostname on which the account
existed.  Networks were not given names, per se, although the IP address
specified a network number.

For example, "knight@phrackvax" referred to user "knight" on host "phrackvax."
This did not specify which network "phrackvax" was on, although that
information could be obtained by examining the hosttable and the IP address for
"phrackvax."  (However, "phrackvax" is a ficticious hostname used for this
presentation.)

As time went on, every computer on the network had to have an entry in its
hosttable for every other computer on the network.  When several networks
linked together to form the Internet, the problem of maintaining this central
hosttable got out of hand.  Therefore, the domain name scheme was introduced to
split up the hosttable and make it smaller and easier to maintain.

In the new domain name scheme, users are still identified by their usernames,
but hosts are now identified by their hostname and any and all domains of which
they are a part.  For example, the following address,
"KNIGHT@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU" specifies username "KNIGHT" on host "UMCVMB".
However, host "UMCVMB" is a part of the domain "MISSOURI" " which is in turn
part of the domain "EDU".  There are other domains in "EDU", although only one
is named "MISSOURI".  In the domain "MISSOURI", there is only one host named
"UMCVMB".

However, other domains in "EDU" could theoretically have hosts named "UMCVMB"
(although I would say that this is rather unlikely in this example).  Thus the
combination of hostname and all its domains makes it unique.  The method of
translating such names into IP addresses is no longer as straightforward as
looking up the hostname in a table.  Several protocols and specialized network
software called nameservers and resolvers implement the domain name scheme.

Not all TCP/IP implementations support domain names because it is rather new.
In those cases, the local hosttable provides the only way to translate
hostnames to IP addresses.  The system manager of that computer will have to
put an entry into the hosttable for every host that users may want to connect
to.  In some cases, users may consult the nameserver themselves to find out the
IP address for a given hostname and then use that IP address directly instead
of a hostname.

I have selected a few network hosts to demonstrate how a host system can be
specified by both the hostname and host numerical address.  Some of the nodes I
have selected are also nodes on BITnet, perhaps even some of the others that I
do not make a note of due a lack of omniscent awareness about each and every
single host system in the world :-)

Please Note:  Not every system on BITnet has an IP address.  Likewise, not
              every system that has an IP address is on BITnet.  Also, while
              some locations like Stanford University may have nodes on BITnet
              and have hosts on the IP as well, this does not neccessarily
              imply that the systems on BITnet and on IP (the EDU domain in
              this case) are the same systems.

              Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems on the Internet
              are not tolerated and is legally a federal offense.  At some
              hosts, they take this very seriously, especially the government
              hosts such as NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where they do
              not mind telling you so at the main prompt when you connect to
              their system.

              However, some nodes are public access to an extent.  The DDN
              Network Information Center can be used by anyone.  The server and
              database there have proven to be an invaluable source of
              information when locating people, systems, and other information
              that is related to the Internet.

Telnet

~~~~~~
Remote login refers to logging in to a remote computer from a terminal
connected to a local computer.  Telnet is the standard protocol in the DOD
Protocol Suite for accomplishing this.  The "rlogin" program, provided with
Berkeley UNIX systems and some other systems, also enables remote login.

For purposes of discussion, the "local computer" is the computer to which your
terminal is directly connected while the "remote computer" is the computer on
the network to which you are communicating and to which your terminal is *NOT*
directly connected.

Since some computers use a different method of attaching terminals to
computers, a better definition would be the following:  The "local computer" is
the computer that you are currently using and the "remote computer" is the
computer on the network with which you are or will be communicating.  Note that
the terms "host" and "computer" are synonymous in the following discussion.

To use Telnet, simply enter the command: TELNET

The prompt that Telnet gives is:  Telnet>

(However, you can specify where you want to Telnet to immediately and bypass
the the prompts and other delays by issuing the command:  TELNET [location].)

There is help available by typing in ?.  This prints a list of all the valid
subcommands that Telnet provides with a one-line explanation.

Telnet> ?

To connect to to another computer, use the open subcommand to open a connection
to that computer.  For example, to connect to the host "UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU",
do "open umcvmb.missouri.edu"

Telnet will resolve (i.e. Translate, the hostname "umcvmb.missouri.edu" into an
IP address and will send a packet to that host requesting login.  If the remote
host decides to let you attempt a login, it prompts you for your username and
password.  If the host does not respond, Telnet will "time out" (i.e. Wait for
a reasonable amount of time such as 20 seconds) and then terminate with a
message such as "Host not responding."

If your computer does not have an entry for a remote host in its hosttable and
it cannot resolve the name, you can use the IP address explicitly in the telnet
command.  For example,

TELNET 26.0.0.73 (Note:  This is the IP address for the DDN Network Information
                 Center [SRI-NIC.ARPA])

If you are successful in logging in, your terminal is connected to the remote
host.  For all intents and purposes, your terminal is directly hard-wired to
that host and you should be able to do anything on your remote terminal that
you can do at any local terminal.  There are a few exceptions to this rule,
however.

Telnet provides a network escape character, such as CONTROL-T. You can find out
what the escape character is by entering the "status" subcommand:

Telnet> status

You can change the escape character by entering the "escape" subcommand:

Telnet> escape

When you type in the escape character, the Telnet prompt returns to your screen
and you can enter subcommands.  For example, to break the connection, which
usually logs you off the remote host, enter the subcommand "quit":

Telnet> quit

Your Telnet connection usually breaks when you log off the remote host, so the
"quit" subcommand is not usually used to log off.

When you are logged in to a remote computer via Telnet, remember that there is
a time delay between your local computer and the remote one.  This often
becomes apparent to users when scrolling a long file across the terminal screen
nd they wish to cancel the scrolling by typing CONTROL-C or something similar.
After typing the special control character, the scrolling continues.  The
special control character takes a certain amount of time to reach the remote
computer which is still scrolling information.  Thus response from the remote
computer will not likely be as quick as response from a local computer.

Once you are remotely logged on, the computer you are logged on to effectively
becomes your "local computer," even though your original "local computer" still
considers you logged on.  You can log on to a third computer which would then
become your "local computer" and so on.  As you log out of each session, your
previous session becomes active again.


File Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FTP is the program that allows files to be sent from one computer to another.
"FTP" stands for "File Transfer Protocol".

When you start using FTP, a communications channel with another computer on the
network is opened.  For example, to start using FTP and initiate a file
transfer session with a computer on the network called "UMCVMB", you would
issue the following subcommand:

FTP UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU

Host "UMCVMB" will prompt you for an account name and password.  If your login
is correct, FTP will tell you so, otherwise it will say "login incorrect."  Try
again or abort the FTP program.  (This is usually done by typing a special
control character such as CONTROL-C.  The "program abort" character varies from
system to system.)

Next you will see the FTP prompt, which is:

Ftp>

There are a number of subcommands of FTP.  The subcommand "?" will list these
commands and a brief description of each one.

You can initiate a file transfer in either direction with FTP, either from the
remote host or to the remote host.  The "get" subcommand initiates a file
transfer from the remote host (i.e. Tells the remote computer to send the file
to the local computer [the one on which you issued the "ftp" command]).  Simply
enter "get" and  FTP will prompt you for the remote host's file name and the
(new) local host's file name.  Example:

Ftp> get
Remote file name?
theirfile
local file name?
myfile

ou can abbreviate this by typing both file names on the same line as the "get"
subcommand.  If you do not specify a local file name, the new local file will
be called the same thing as the remote file.  Valid FTP subcommands to get a
file include the following:

get theirfile myfile
get doc.x25

The "put" subcommand works in a similar fashion and is used to send a file from
the local computer to the remote computer.  Enter the command "put" and FTP
will prompt you for the local file name and then the remote file name.  If the
transfer cannot be done because the file doesn't exist or for some other
reason, FTP will print an error message.

There are a number of other subcommands in FTP that allow you to do many more
things.  Not all of these are standard so consult your local documentation or
type a question mark at the FTP prompt.  Some functions often built into FTP
include the ability to look at files before getting or putting them, the
ability to change directories, the ability to delete files on the remote
computer, and the ability to list the directory on the remote host.

An intriguing capability of many FTP implementations is "third party
transfers."  For example, if you are logged on computer A and you want to cause
computer B to send a file to computer C, you can use FTP to connect to computer
B and use the "rmtsend" command.  Of course, you have to know usernames and
passwords on all three computers, since FTP never allows you to peek into
someone's directory and files unless you know their username and password.

The "cd" subcommand changes your working directory on the remote host.  The
"lcd" subcommand changes the directory on the local host.  For UNIX systems,
the meaning of these subcommands is obvious.  Other systems, especially those
that do not have directory-structured file system, may not implement these
commands or may implement them in a different manner.

The "dir" and "ls" subcommands do the same thing, namely list the files in the
working directory of of the remote host.

The "list" subcommand shows the contents of a file without actually putting it
into a file on the local computer.  This would be helpful if you just wanted to
inspect a file.  You could interrupt it before it reached the end of the file
by typing CONTROL-C or some other special character.  This is dependent on your
FTP implementation.

The "delete" command can delete files on the remote host.  You can also make
and remove directories on the remote host with "mkdir" and "rmdir".  The
"status" subcommand will tell you if you are connected and with whom and what
the state of all your options are.

If you are transferring binary files or files with any non-printable
characters, turn binary mode on by entering the "binary" subcommand:

binary

To resume non-binary transfers, enter the "ascii" subcommand.

Transferring a number of files can be done easily by using "mput" (multiple
put) and "mget" (multiple get).  For example, to get every file in a particular
directory, first issue a "cd" command to  change to that directory and then an
"mget" command with an asterisk to indicate every file:

cd somedirectory
mget *

When you are done, use the "close" subcommand to break the communications link.
You will still be in FTP, so you must use the "bye" subcommand to exit FTP and
return to the command level.  The "quit" subcommand will close the connection
and exit from FTP at the same time.


Mail
~~~~
Mail is the simplest network facility to use in many ways.  All you have to do
is to create your message, which can be done with a file editor or on the spur
of the moment, and then send it.  Unlike FTP and Telnet, you do not need to
know the password of the username on the remote computer.  This is so because
you cannot change or access the files of the remote user nor can you use their
account to run programs.  All you can do is to send a message.

There is probably a program on your local computer which does mail between
users on that computer.  Such a program is called a mailer.  This may or may
not be the way to send or receive mail from other computers on the network,
although integrated mailers are more and more common.  UNIX mailers will be
used as an example in this discussion.

Note that the protocol which is used to send and receive mail over a TCP/IP
network is called SMTP, the "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol."  Typically, you
will not use any program called SMTP, but rather your local mail program.

UNIX mailers are usually used by invoking a program named "mail".  To receive
new mail, simply type "mail".

There are several varieties of UNIX mailers in existence.  Consult your local
documentation for details.  For example, the command "man mail" prints out the
manual pages for the mail program on your computer.

To send mail, you usually specify the address of the recipient on the mail
command.  For example: "mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu" will send the
following message to username "knight" on host "umcvmb".

You can usually type in your message one line at a time, pressing RETURN after
each line and typing CONTROL-D to end the message. Other facilities to include
already-existing files sometimes exist.  For example, Berkeley UNIXes allow you
to enter commands similar to the following to include a file in your current
mail message:

r myfile

In this example, the contents of "myfile" are inserted into the message at this
point.

Most UNIX systems allow you to send a file through the mail by using input
redirection.  For example:

mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu < myfile

In this example, the contents of "myfile" are sent as a message to "knight" on
"umcvmb."

Note that in many UNIX systems the only distinction between mail bound for
another user on the same computer and another user on a remote computer is
simply the address specified.  That is, there is no hostname for local
recipients.  Otherwise, mail functions in exactly the same way.  This is common
for integrated mail packages.  The system knows whether to send the mail
locally or through the network based on the address and the user is shielded
from any other details.

| Remark: I have also included some obviously misstyped NUAs which have been  |
|         found in widely circulating lists.  There are also numbers which do |
|         not form a valid NUA but a common prefix (e.g. 0202 2  Helpak).     |
|                                                                             |
| Format: Each NUA in this list consists of the following fields:             |
|                                                                             |
|         cccc naa aaa aaa... oooo...      ddd....                            |
|                                                                             |
|  cccc       is the country prefix (e.g. 0262 Germany). This prefix can be   |
|             omitted when calling and called party have both the same prefix.|
|  naa        are the first three digits of the address. n often specifies a  |
|             certain network in that country.                                |
|  aaa aaa... are the other digits of the address.                            |
|  oooo...    are some extra digits/letters which should be added after the   |
|             NUA. The correct syntax depends on your PAD. This list uses any |
|             syntax - usually depending on the notation the author of the    |
|             source used. The oooo... field is usually empty.                |
|  ddd...     is a short description of the service.                          |
|                                                                             |
| If you find two NUAs who differ only in the number of trailing zeroes, but  |
| connect to the same service, you may safely throw away the longer one.      |
|                                                                             |
|  !!  Please note that most PADs don't accept spaces inside a NUA  !!        |

                                    COSMOS

                   COmputer System for Mainframe OperationS

                                   Part Two

                                by King Arthur


     This article will present solutions to the computer security problems
presented in my previous file.  The following are simple but often neglected
items which if properly treated can immensely increase your company's computer
security.  These points apply not merely in regards to COSMOS, but to all
computers in all companies.


A) Dial-Up Security:

     When securing a computer system, regardless of its type, it's important to
remember this: the only way someone can remotely access your system is if there
is a dial-up line leading to that system.  If your system has a dial-up, make
sure that you have taken every possible precaution to secure that line.  "The
one piece of advice I would give is:  Be careful with dial-up lines," says
Bellcore's Ed Pinnes.

     Dave Imparato, Manager of Database Management at New York Telephone, says,
"We have devices that sit in front of our computers that you have to gain
access to.  In order to even get to COSMOS, there are three or four levels of
security you have to go through, and that's before you even get to the system."

Rules for protection of Dial-Up lines:

1.  Have as few dial-up lines as possible.  Private lines or direct connections
    are often a viable replacement for dial-up lines.

2.  If you must have phone lines going to your computer, use external hardware,
    if possible.  For instance, the Datakit Virtual Circuit Switch (VCS) will
    require a user to specify an "access password" and a system destination to
    specify which system you are calling.  The VCS would then connect you to
    the requested system which would prompt you for a login and password.
    Using hardware similar to this serves a double purpose:

         A) It is harder for someone to get into your computer, due to
            additional passwords;

         B) Employees need only dial a single number to access a number of
            systems.

    Another good type of hardware is a callback modem.  A callback modem will
    prompt users for a login and password.  If these are correct, the modem
    will automatically callback to a predetermined number.  At that point you
    would login to the computer.  The advantage of callback is that unless a
    call is placed from a certain phone, there is no way to connect.
    Unfortunately, this is not always efficient for systems with large numbers
    of users.

    Lastly, and the most effective means of access, is to have a system which
    does not identify itself.  A caller has to enter a secret password, which
    doesn't display on the screen.  If a caller doesn't type the correct
    password, the system will hang up, without ever telling the caller what has
    happened.

3.  If you ever detect "hackers" calling a certain number, it is advisable to
    change that number.  Phone numbers should be unlisted.  According to a
    hacker, he once got the number to an AT&T computer by asking directory
    assistance for the number of AT&T at 976 Main Street.

4.  If dial-up lines aren't used on nights or weekends, they should be
    disabled.  Computer hackers usually conduct their "business" on nights or
    weekends.  The COSMOS system has the ability to restrict access by time of
    day.


B) Password Security:

     Using the analogy between a computer and a file cabinet, you can compare a
password to the lock on your file cabinet.  By having accounts with no
passwords you are, in effect, leaving your file cabinet wide open.  A system's
users will often want passwords that are easy to remember.  This is not an
advisable idea, especially for a database system with many users.  The first
passwords tried by hackers are the obvious.  For instance if MF01 is known to
be the user name for the frame room, a hacker might try MF01, FRAME, MDF, or
MAINFRAME as passwords.  If it's known to a hacker that the supervisor at the
MDF is Peter Pinkerton,  PETE or PINKERTON would not be very good passwords.

Rules for password selection:

1.  Passwords should be chosen by system administrators or the like.  Users
    will often choose passwords which provide no security.  They should not be
    within the reach of everybody in the computer room, but instead should be
    sent via company mail to the proper departments.

2.  Passwords should be changed frequently, but on an irregular basis -- every
    four to seven weeks is advisable.  Department supervisors should be
    notified of password changes via mail, a week in advance.  This would
    ensure that all employees are aware of the change at the proper time.  One
    thing you don't want is mass confusion, where everybody is trying to figure
    out why they can't access their computers.

3.  System administrators' passwords should be changed twice as often because
    they can allow access to all system resources.  If possible, system
    administrator accounts should be restricted from logging in on a dial-up
    line.

4.  A password should NEVER be the same as the account name.  Make sure that
    ALL system defaults are changed.

5.  Your best bet is to make passwords a random series of letters and  numbers.
    For example 3CB06W1, Q9IF0L4, or F4W21D0.  All passwords need not be the
    same length or format.  Imparato says, "We built a program in a PC that
    generates different security passwords for different systems and makes sure
    there's no duplication."

6.  It's important to change passwords whenever an employee leaves the company
    or even changes departments.  Imparato says, "When managers leave our
    organization, we make sure we change those passwords which are necessary to
    operate the system."

7.  The Unix operating system has a built-in "password aging" feature, which
    requires a mandatory change of passwords after a period of time.  If you
    run any Unix-based systems, it's important to activate password aging.

8.  When you feel you have experienced a problem, change ALL passwords,  not
    just those passwords involved with the incident.


C) Site security:

     There have been a number of articles written by hackers and published in
2600 Magazine dealing with garbage picking or what hackers call "trashing".
It's important to keep track of what you throw out.  In many companies,
proprietary operations manuals are thrown out.  COSMOS itself is not a
user-friendly system.  In other words, without previous exposure to the system
it would be very difficult to operate.  Bellcore's Beverly Cruse says, "COSMOS
is used in so many places around the country, I wouldn't be surprised if they
found books... in the garbage, especially after divestiture.  One interesting
thing about a COSMOS article written by hackers, is that there was a lot of
obsolete information, so it shows that wherever the information came from... it
was old."

Rules for site security:

1.  Although it may seem evident, employees should be required to show proper
    identification when entering terminal rooms or computer facilities.  It's
    doubtful that a hacker would ever attempt to infiltrate any office, but
    hackers aren't the only people you have to worry about.

2.  Urge employees to memorize login sequences.  It's a bad idea for passwords
    to be scribbled on bits of paper taped to terminals.  Eventually, one of
    those scraps may fall into the wrong hands.

3.  Garbage should be protected as much as possible.  If you use a private
    pick-up, keep garbage in loading docks, basements, or fenced-off areas. If
    you put your garbage out for public sanitation department pick-up, it's a
    good idea to shred sensitive materials.

4.  Before throwing out old manuals or books, see if another department could
    make use of them.  The more employees familiar with the system, the less of
    a chance that there will be a security problem.

5.  Printing terminals should be inspected to make sure that passwords are not
    readable.  If passwords are found to echo, check to see if the duplex is
    correct.  Some operating systems allow you to configure dial-ups for
    printer use.


D) Employee Security:

     When a hacker impersonates an employee, unless he is not successful there
is a great chance the incident will go unreported.  Even if the hacker doesn't
sound like he knows what he's talking about, employees will often excuse the
call as an unintelligent or uninformed person.  It's unpleasant to have to
worry about every call with an unfamiliar voice on the other end of the phone,
but it is necessary.

Rules for employee security:

1.  When making an inter-departmental call, always identify yourself with:
    1) Your name; 2) Your title; and 3) Your department and location.

2.  Be suspicious of callers who sound like children, or those who ask you
    questions that are out of the ordinary.  Whenever someone seems suspicious,
    get their supervisor's name and a callback number.  Don't discuss anything
    sensitive until you can verify their identity.  Don't ever discuss
    passwords over the phone.

3.  When there is a security problem with a system, send notices to all users
    instructing them not to discuss the system over the phone, especially if
    they do not already know the person to whom they are talking.

4.  Remind all dial-up users of systems, before hanging up.

5.  If security-minded posters are put up around the workplace, employees are
    bound to take more care in their work and in conversations on the phone.

6.  If managers distribute this and other computer security articles to
    department supervisors employee security will be increased.


E) General Security:

     Bellcore recently sent a package to all system administrators of COSMOS
systems.  The package detailed security procedures  which applied to COSMOS and
Unix-based systems.  If you are a recipient of this package, you should re-read
it thoroughly to ensure that your systems are secure.  Cruse says, "Last
year... I had a call from someone within an operating company with a COSMOS
security problem.  All we really did was give them documentation which reminded
them of existing security features...  There is built-in security in the COSNIX
operating system...  We really didn't give them anything new at the time.  The
features were already there; we gave them the recommendation that they
implement all of them."

     If you feel you may not be using available security features to the
fullest, contact the vendors of your computer systems and request documentation
on security.  Find out if there are security features that you may not be
currently taking advantage of.  There are also third party software companies
that sell security packages for various operating systems and computers.

     Computer security is a very delicate subject.  Many people try to pretend
that there is no such thing as computer crime.  Since the problem exists, the
best thing to do is to study the problems and figure out the best possible
solutions.  If more people were to write or report about computer security, it
would be easier for everyone else to protect themselves.  I would like to see
Bellcore publish security guidelines, available to the entire
telecommunications industry.  Keep in mind, a chain is only as strong as its
weakest link.

             contained in this article, nor for any damage caused by the use of
             methods described.  DECNET, VAX, and VMS are possibly registered
             trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation.


There comes a time when every somewhat intelligent programmer asks:  Is hacking
difficult?  Now, being in a university network, why don't just give it a try?
Since one is an official student and somewhat authorized to use the computing
facilities, testing the modern means of communication should cause no trouble.

Well, you start searching on those nodes, you have official access for
interesting programs and procedures.  And you find:  Netdcl, just one program
of many, that obviously enables one to run commands on remote nodes without
having an account on these nodes.  A really interesting thing, as nearly
everything is allowed that a normal user can do.

The dear reader may start to think:  Wasn't there always the shouting about VMS
being the MOST SECURE computer system, making it UNPENETRABLE to hackers?  Ok,
cool down, this feature can be disabled and so, you think, if someone has super
secret data on his VAX, he will stop any use or abuse of this feature.

2nd Act -- Somewhere one has heard about some mystery things called system
calls.  Since one always wanted to know about how to react on keystrokes on a
VAX (really being not trivial!) you start reading the manuals more precisely to
find out how to do it in Pascal.

Randomly on browsing thru the pages you discover functions which deliver
information about Userids.  This comes in handy, as a friend engaged in
university politics wants to distribute a leaflet by email to all registered
users.  In fact, it's completely unproblematic to gain a list of all users.  An
example program, although written in Assembler, is even contained in the
manuals.  Enjoy a list of 1000 Userids complete with information about network
access rights.  The Pascal program is contained in Appendix B (later in this
file).

Sorry, passwords are not stored in this list.  Even the Sysop can't access
them, so that's no great loss.  Guess what passwords many accounts have?  Sure,
just try the username.  It's really amazing how ignorant users can be.  Of
course this is a problem of group-accounts, that many users have access to and
must know the password.  Nevertheless, the hole is there.

The real hacker, once he has logged in on such an account surely finds ways to
gain system privilege.  This requires in-depth knowledge of the Kernel of VMS
and is another story I won't deal with.


What is DECNET?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DECNET is the means, by which computers from Digital Equipment Corporation
(DEC) can be connected to each other.  Each computer in this network has an
address which is normally given by x.y where x is the area number (an integer)
and y is the node number in this area which ranges from 1 to 1023.  To access
DECNET nodes, one specifies just one number, which can be computed from x and y
by the following formula:

   nodenumber = x * 1024 + y

Often nodes, especially local nodes (having the same area number as your
current node) have names assigned to them so they can be memorized more easily.


Interesting DECNET Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get a (first) list of available DECNET nodes, try the command

   $ SHOW NET

The $ (as in the following examples) is the default prompt of VMS and should
not be entered.  This Command will give you a list of (hopefully) reachable
nodes.  All lines of the output contain the network address in the form x.y and
normally a name which this node is known by.

Your current node is mentioned in the first line in "VAX/VMS network status for
local node X.Y Name".  In most cases you will then just see local nodes listed
and a line saying "The next hop to the nearest area router is node XX.YY".
This node contains more information about the DECNET than the node you are
currently on.  If you have an account on the specified node, log on there and
try again.  If not, well, play with the local nodes listed and look at the
command NCP shown later.

Now, what can you do with those nodes that were mentioned in the output?
First command is

    $ SET HOST <node>

Where <node> is either a nodename or a nodenumber (see above).  Thus, if SDIVAX
was listed in the SHOW NET list as 42.13, then you may try both SET HOST SDIVAX
or SET HOST 43021 (42*1024+13 = 43021).  Probably you'll get that ugly
Username: prompt.  You're on your own then.

Second thing you can do with DECNET is email.  On VMS the MAIL program can send
mail to other users.  If you and your friend both have accounts on the same
DECNET, you can send him mail if you know his nodename or nodenumber by
specifying SDIVAX::FREDDY or 43021::FREDDY.

Then there is PHONE.  This is a utility to talk to another (or several) user(s)
on a DECNET.  If you want to call Freddy, just type PHONE SDIVAX::FREDDY.  If
he is logged in, his terminal will ring and if he answers his phone (with PHONE
ANSWER) you may chat with him.  PHONE has another nice feature built in:  You
may ask for a list of active users on a remote name by %DIR SDIVAX.  See the
online help on PHONE for further details.

The next really mighty DECNET facility is remote file access.  Valid filenames
in VMS consist of the components node, disk, directory and filename.  An
example for a valid filename is SDIVAX::DISK$2:[NASA.SECRET]SDI.DOC where some
components may be omitted and default values are used instead.

File names including the node specification may be used in nearly all VMS
commands examples being DIR, TYPE and COPY.  Access to the specified file is
granted, if the protection of the file allows access by world, or if the owner
of the file is the user DECNET.  This pseudo userid is available on every VAX
and has the password DECNET.  Access to that account is limited to network
processing so you can't just log in with Username=DECNET, password=DECNET.  By
default a special directory owned by the User DECNET exists on each node.  This
directory can be accessed by just specifying the nodename without any disk or
directory information, as in

    $ DIR SDIVAX::

If users played too much with this feature, the directory may be protected or
otherwise disabled.

The last feature described here is the remote command processing facility.  If
you try to open a file with the specification

    $ SDIVAX::"task=foo.com"

Instead of opening the DCL procedure, foo.com will be executed.  To make use of
this feature easily, programs have been written to interactively communicate
with a remote host.  The command procedure NETDCL.COM does this task and is
contained in the Appendix A (seen later in this file.  Look at this
DCL-Procedure to learn more about DECNET features.


The Key To Universal Knowledge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a pearl under the programs on a VAX.  It's called NCP and will give
readily information about the whole DECNET.  You start this program either by
MCR NCP or by doing a SET DEF SYS$SYSTEM and RUN NCP.  Use the on-line Help
provided in NCP (which means Network Control Program) to learn more.

    NCP> SHOW KNOWN NODES

Provides a list of all nodes known on your current node, including the names
you may use as node specifications.  But there is more:  You may connect to
another node's database and get a list of nodes which are known at the remote
node with

    NCP> SET EXEC SDIVAX

And then again the SHOW KNOWN NODES command.  This feature should provide you
with a nearly infinite list of node names and node numbers.


Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~
There are many nice features available under DECNET.  Probably I don't know
all, but I hope this article showed you the mighty tools available on VMS to
make network life easier.


WARNING:  The author has had bad experiences with some node administrators,
          who didn't like their machines being contacted over DECNET.  Yes,
          that's the drawback, each DECNET activity is written to a protocol
          file that is printed and deleted every month.  So you should be
          careful in using DECNET.

Prologue For None VMS Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     DECnet is the network for DEC machines, in most cases you can say VAXes.
DECnet allows you to do:   - e-mail
                           - file transfer
                           - remote login
                           - remote command
                           - remote job entry
                           - PHONE
     PHONE is an interactive communication between users and is equal to TALK
on UNIX or a "deluxe"-CHAT on VM/CMS.

     BELWUE, the university network of the state Baden-Wuerttemberg in
West Germany contains (besides other networks) a DECnet with about 400 VAXes.
On every VAX there is standard-account called DECNET with pw:= DECNET, which is
not reachable via remote login.  This account is provided for several
DECnet-Utilities and as a pseudo-guest-account.  The DECNET-account has very
restricted privileges:  You cannot edit a file or make another remote login.

    The HELP-menu is equipped by the system and is similar to the MAN command
on UNIX.

    More information on DECnet can be found in "Looking Around In DECnet" by
Deep Thought in this very issue of Phrack Inc.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

     Here, at the University of Ulm, we have an *incredibly* ignorant computer
center staff, with an even bigger lack of system-literature (besides the 80 kg
of VAX/VMS-manuals).  The active may search for information by himself, which
is over the level of "run," "FORTRAN," or "logout."  My good luck that I have
other accounts in the BELWUE-DECnet, where more information is offered for the
users.  I am a regular student in Ulm and all my accounts are completely legal
and corresponding to the German laws.  I don't call myself a "hacker," I feel
more like a "user" (...it's more a defining-problem).

     In the HELP-menu in a host in Tuebingen I found the file netdcl.com and
the corresponding explanation, which sends commands to the DECNET-Account of
other VAXes and executes them there (remote command).  The explanation in the
HELP-menu was idiot-proof -- therefore for me, too :-)

     With the command "$ mcr ncp show known nodes" you can obtain a list of all
netwide active VAXes, as is generally known, and so I pinged all these VAXes to
look for more information for a knowledge-thirsty user.  With "help", "dir" and
other similar commands I look around on those DECnet accounts, always watching
for topics related to the BELWUE-network.  It's a pity, that 2/3 of all VAXes
have locked the DECNET-Account for NETDCL.COM.  Their system managers are
probably afraid of unauthorized access, but I cannot imagine how there could be
such an unauthorized access, because you cannot log on this account -- no
chance for trojan horses, etc.

     Some system managers called me back after I visited their VAX to chat with
me about the network and asked me if they could help me in any way. One sysop
from Stuttgart even sent me a version of NETDCL.COM for the ULTRIX operation
system.

     Then, after a month, the  H O R R O R  came over me in shape of a the
following mail:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM       31-MAY-1989 15:31:11.38
To:     FRAMSTAG
CC:
Subj:   don't make any crap, or you'll be kicked out!

From:   ITTGPX::SYSTEM       29-MAY-1989 16:46
To:     TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM
Subj:   System-breaking-in 01-May-1989

To the system manager of the Computer TUEBINGEN,

On May 1st 1989 we had a System-breaking-in in our DECNET-account, which
started from your machine.  By help of our accounting we ascertained your user
FRAMSTAG to have emulated an interactive log-on on our backbone-node and on
every machine of our VAX-cluster with the "trojan horse" NETDCL.COM.  Give us
this user's name and address and dear up the occurrence completely.  We point
out that the user is punishable.  In case of repetition we would be forced to
take corresponding measures.  We will check whether our system got injured.  If
not, this time we will disregard any measure.  Inform us via DECnet about your
investigation results -- we are attainable by the nodenumber 1084::system

Dipl.-Ing. Michael Hager
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     My system manager threatened me with the deleting of my account, if I
would not immediately enlighten the affair.  *Gulp*!
     I was conscious about my innocence, but how to tell it to the others?  I
explained, step by step, everything to my system manager.  He then understood
after a while, but the criminal procedure still hovered over me... so, I took
quickly to my keyboard, to compose file of explanations and to send it to that
angry system manager in Stuttgart (node 1084 is an institute there).  But no
way out:  He had run out of disk quota and my explanation-mail sailed into the
nirwana:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
$ mail explanation
  To:   1084::system
%MAIL-E, error sending to user SYSTEM at 1084
%MAIL-E-OPENOUT, error opening SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]MAIL$00040092594FD194.MAI;
as output
-RMS-E-CRE, ACP file create failed
-SYSTEM-F-EXDISKQUOTA, disk quota exceeded
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     Also the attempt of a connection with the PHONE-facilty failed:  In his
borderless hacker-paranoia, he cut off his PHONE... and nowhere is a list with
the REAL-addresses of the virtual DECnet-addresses available (to prevent
hacking).  Now I stood there with the brand "DANGEROUS HACKER!" and I had no
chance to vindicate myself.  I poured out my troubles to an acquaintance of
mine, who is a sysop in the computer-center in Freiburg.  He asked other sysops
and managers thru the whole BELWUE-network until someone gave him a telephone
number after a few days -- and that was the right one!

     I phoned to this Hager and told him what I had done with his
DECnet-account and also what NOT.  I wanted to know which crime I had
committed.  He promptly cancelled all of his reproaches, but he did not excuse
his defamous incriminations.  I entreated him to inform my system manager in
Tuebingen that I have done nothing illegal and to stop him from erasing my
account.  This happens already to a fellow student of mine (in this case, Hager
was also guilty).  He promised me that he would officially cancel his
reproaches.

     After over a week this doesn't happen (I'm allowed to use my account
further on).  In return for it, I received a new mail from Hager on another
account of mine:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   1084::HAGER         1-JUN-1989 12:51
To:     50180::STUD_11
Subj:   System-breaking-in

On June 1st 1989 you have committed a system-breaking-in on at least one of our
VAXes.  We were able to register this occurrence.  We would be forced to take
further measure if you did not dear up the occurrence completely until June
6th.

Of course the expenses involved would be imposed on you.  Hence enlightenment
must be in your own interest.

We are attainable via DECnet-mail with the address 1084::HAGER or via following
address:

Institut fuer Technische Thermodynamik und Thermische Verfahrenstechnik
Dipl.-Ing. M. Hager    Tel.: 0711/685-6109

7000 Stuttgart-80

This was the reaction of my attempt: "$ PHONE 1084::SYSTEM".  I have not
answered to this mail.  I AM SICK OF IT!

                         The Postal Inspection Service

                 (C) UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE (U.S. MAIL)

                               Brought to you by

                                   Vendetta

                                 May 10, 1989

                   +======================================+


Protecting The U.S. Mails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The protection of the U.S. Mail and the mail system is the responsibility of
the Postal Inspection Service.  As the law enforcement and audit arm of the
U.S. Postal Service, the Inspection Service is a highly specialized,
professional organization performing investigative, law enforcement, and audit
functions essential to a stable and sound postal system.

As our country's oldest federal law enforcement agency, the Inspection Service
has jurisdiction in all criminal matters infringing on the integrity and
security of the mail, and the safety of all postal valuables, property, and
personnel.

Since the beginning of a postal system in this country, criminal and
administrative problems of the Postal Service have been interwoven.  By
detecting and investigating crimes against the mail and postal revenue,
establishing safe and efficient postal systems, protecting all postal
properties, assuring that the postal system is not criminally misused to the
detriment of the public, the Inspection Service plays an integral part in
maintaining effective operations in the Postal Service.

The agency's activities make a vital contribution to the protection of the
nation's economy.  Security and enforcement functions of the Inspection Service
provide assurance to American business for the safe exchange of funds and
securities through the U.S. Mail, and to postal customers of the sanctity of
the seal in transmitting correspondence and messages to all parts of the world.
Audits ensure stability to financial operations, help control costs, and
promote increased efficiency in our Postal Service.


Postal Inspectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Postal Inspectors are the fact finding and investigative agents of the U.S.
Postal Service.  Today nearly two-thirds of their time is spent in
investigating and solving postal related crimes.  Possessing statutory power of
arrest, they apprehend violators of the law and work closely with U.S.
Attorneys in prosecuting cases in court.  Their work also includes crime
prevention, the audit of postal operations, investigation of accidents and a
wide variety of other service and audit matters.

The work of a Postal Inspector requires total dedication and a willingness to
work long hours.  Investigations of postal crimes which often entail interstate
or international coordination, and the responsibility to restore mail service
following catastrophes such as floods, fire, and airplane wrecks, are
time-consuming and can be hazardous.

There are approximately 1,900 Postal Inspectors stationed in the United States
and Puerto Rico.  All trainees undergo an eleven-week basic training course
involving use of firearms, defensive tactics, legal matters, search and
seizure, arrest techniques, court procedures, postal operations, audit
functions, and a detailed study of the federal laws in which the Inspection
Service has jurisdiction.  Classes are conducted at the Inspection Service
training center in Potomac, Maryland.

Refresher courses keep Inspectors informed of current court decisions, laws,
and legal procedures.  Additional specialized courses are continually held to
equip the Service with expertly trained personnel.

All applicants for the position of Postal Inspector must successfully complete
the following steps; entry examination; a comprehensive background
investigation including ma medical examination; the candidate assessment center
review; and all phases of the basic training course.


Inspection Service Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Criminal investigations and postal crime prevention represent
             the greatest portion of Inspection Service activity.

Postal Inspectors investigate violations of all postal laws and other related
criminal violations.  Crimes within the purview of postal investigations
include mail fraud, the illegal transmission of controlled substances through
the U.S. Mail, the mailing of child pornography, thefts of mails or postal
valuables, assaults on postal employees, bombs sent through the mails or
directed against postal properties, and the mailing of matter containing
poison, unauthorized concealable firearms, and harmful or prohibited articles.

Five crime laboratories located throughout the country assist Inspectors in
analyzing evidentiary material needed for identifying and tracing criminal
suspects and in providing expert testimony for cases brought to trial.

The objectives of postal crime prevention are to anticipate, identify, and
analyze those areas of greatest crime risk potentially affecting employees,
funds, property, and postal customers.  Postal Inspectors then take action to
remove or reduce that risk and maintain the integrity of the Postal Service.

                "The Postal Inspection Service is responsible
                for the internal audit of the Postal Service."

Postal Inspectors provide management with independent audits and investigations
of all postal activities as a part of the Postal Service's internal control
system.

Audits of installations and systems protect the assets of the Service, improve
its financial management system, assist in the resolution of customer
complaints, investigate matters of Congressional interests, and identify
specific improvements for better customer service and more economical
operations.

Financial audits provide an independent check on the adequacy and effectiveness
of control systems; verify the existence of assets and ensure the proper
safeguards are maintained.  Operations audits are conducted to assist postal
management in the operation of an efficient, and reliable Postal Service.


Security Force
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Postal Police Officers provide protection to mail, postal valuables, postal
employees, facilities, and vehicles of the Postal Service.  As part of the law
enforcement team, they assist Postal Inspectors in the enforcement of certain
postal laws and regulations on postal premises and provide mobile response
unites in emergency situations involving the Postal Service.

Equipped with portable radios and alerted by closed circuit television they
provide perimeter security to major postal facilities and other buildings
operated by the Postal Service.  Their presence in postal installations
throughout the country is a deterrent to postal crimes and an aid to employee
morale.

Postal Police Officers also are used to escort high value mail while in transit
between postal units and at airports.

Experience in military or civil law enforcement, industrial security, or
similar occupations is an asset for positions in the Security Force.  All
appointees undergo a four-week training course conducted at the Inspection
Service's training center.


Coordination With Other Agencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Inspection Service extends full cooperation to all local and federal
investigative and prosecutive authorities in law enforcement matters to ensure
greater protection to the public.  Postal Inspectors participate in the
Department of Justice national strike force teams aimed at curtailing
widespread criminal acts of an organized nature.  Postal Inspectors also work
closely with the External Auditors in providing support to the certification of
the Postal Service's financial statements.


Conviction Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Inspection Service maintains a consistently high conviction rate each year
of approximately 98% of cases brought to trial, a rate not exceeded by any
other federal law enforcement agency.


Jurisdiction, Postal Laws, and Protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Inspection Service exercises investigative jurisdiction over approximately
85 postal-related statues.  These can be grouped in two categories:  Criminal
acts against the mails, postal facilities, or postal personnel; and criminal
misuse of the postal system.


MAIL FRAUD

All criminal activity involving use of the U.S. Mail with intent to defraud
comes under the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service.  The Mail Fraud
Law is the oldest consumer protection law in the United States and is one of
the most effective prosecutive tool in fighting white collar and organized
crime.  Millions of dollars are lost each year through mail fraud which cheats
not only the poor and the elderly, but businessmen and the consumer as well.
Prevalent schemes include insurance, banking, false billings; land and
advance-fee selling swindles; franchise schemes; work-at-home and fraudulent
diploma schemes; charity schemes; promotions of fake health cures, beauty
devices, fast-working diets, and sex stimulants; chain letters, lotteries, and
solicitations for the sale of advertising specialty items.

While Postal Inspectors have no statutory authority to act as intermediaries in
the settlement of unsatisfactory financial or property transactions conducted
through the mails, their investigations frequently result in the discontinuance
of fraudulent or borderline operations.  Administrative mail-stop orders may be
issued to prevent continuing public loss while sufficient evidence is being
developed for criminal prosecutive action in the courts, or in cases where
false representations, but not necessarily fraudulent intent, can be proven.
The Inspection Service has a leading role in consumer protection through the
implementation of educational programs designed to prevent mail fraud schemes
from developing, and through its efforts to resolve complaints relating to
consumer/vendor misunderstandings or poor business practices.


ORGANIZED CRIME

Investigations by Postal Inspectors in organized crime matters most frequently
relate to cases involving theft and fencing of large amounts of stamp stock and
securities by organized post office burglary rings; insurance and investment
frauds; and planned bankruptcies and schemes aimed at looting company assets.
The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 specifically includes violation of the
Mail Fraud Statue as "racketeering activity."  Postal Inspectors are assigned
to the Justice Department Organized Crime Strike Forces which operate at various
points throughout the country.


MAIL THEFT/BURGLARY/ROBBERY

Investigation of mail theft offenses are a large part of the Inspection
Service's responsibilities and most commonly involve stolen checks, food
coupons, or other negotiable securities.  Primary attention is directed at
major gangs, sophisticated fencing operations, large scale thefts, and the
implementation of preventive programs.

Burglaries of post offices range from vandalism to high level burglary rings
and fencing operations involving organized crime activity.

Armed robberies endanger the lives of postal employees and the public and,
therefore, are priority investigations.  The targets of these crimes usually
are postal facilities, vehicles transporting mail, and individual employees,
primarily letter carriers.


DRUGS

Illegal trafficking in drugs, narcotics, and other controlled substances
through the mail is investigated in conjunction with other federal and state
law enforcement agencies.


PORNOGRAPHY

The Inspection Service investigates violations of the Postal Obscenity Statue
enacted in 1865 which prohibits the sending of obscene materials through the
U.S. Mail.  This includes the investigation of child pornography offenses
involving the sexual abuse of exploitation of children based on laws passed in
1977 and 1984.


BOMBS

Investigations of incidents of threats involving bombs and incendiary devices
sent through the mails or directed at postal properties or functions are within
the jurisdiction of the Inspection Service.


EXTORTION

The Inspection Service has investigative responsibility in incidents involving
use of the mails to extort money or property by threat of injury to person's
reputation or by accusing a person of a crime.


OTHER PROHIBITED MAILINGS

The mailing of poisons or other harmful matter prohibited by law is
investigated by Postal Inspectors.


Assistance From The Public
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In most cases, the Inspection Service must rely on the watchfulness and
alertness of mail recipients to inform them of possible criminal or harmful
activity involving the use of the mails.  Any suspected violations of postal
laws or misuse of the mails should be reported to the local Postmaster for
referral to a Postal Inspector.  Prompt action on the part of postal customers
and Postal Inspectors is essential in the interest of crime prevention and
detection.

                 Welcome to Issue XXVII of Phrack World News!

This issue features articles on SouthernNet's hacker scam, the Florida
probation sex incident, bulletin boards in Argentina, fax attacks, computer
security, other hacking occurrences, as well as more articles and new
information about Kevin David Mitnick (aka Condor), Robert Tappan Morris, Karl
Koch (Hagbard Celine, one of Clifford Stoll's "Wily Hackers"), TRW and Social
Security Administration, the National Crime Information (NCIC) "Super
Database," and many other fun stories.

Because of our temporary exile from Bitnet, this will be the last regular issue
of Phrack World News until next Fall.  Next issue expect to see the full
write-up on the details and fun events of SummerCon '89.  It is only two days
away as of this writing (it kinda begins on Thursday evening for some of us)
and it looks to be the best SummerCon ever!

A very special thanks goes to Delta Master, Hatchet Molly, and The Mad Hacker
who all assisted with this issue's PWN by submitting articles.  Hatchet Molly
will be serving as a collection agent for Phrack Inc. during the summer.  Be
sure to forward any news articles to him that seem relevant to PWN and he will
get them to me (eventually).  He can be reached on the wide area networks at;

One other thing to mention here is a special hello to one of our government
readers... Peter Edmond Yee of NASA's Ames Research Center.  He had recently
remarked that he "had access to Phrack!"  I wonder if he thought that Phrack
Inc. was top secret or hard to get?  Still if he wanted it that badly, Taran
King and I thought, "Why not make it easier on him and just send it to his
network address?"  We did :-)))

Mitnick Plea Bargain Rejected By Judge As Too Lenient            April 25, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Excerpts from Kim Murphy (Los Angeles Times)

             "Mr. Mitnick, you have been engaging in this conduct
             for too long, and no one has actually punished you.
             This is the last time you are going to do this."

Reportedly U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer unexpectedly rejected the plea
bargain of Kevin Mitnick, the hacker once called "as dangerous with a keyboard
as a bank robber with a gun."  Pfaelzer declared that Mitnick deserves more
time behind bars.

As reported in recent issues of Phrack World News, "Mitnick pleaded guilty to
one count of computer fraud and one count of possessing unauthorized
long-distance telephone codes... Mitnick faces one year in prison.  Under a
plea agreement with the government, he must also submit to three years'
supervision by probation officers after his release from prison."

On April 24, 1989 Judge Pfaelzer said, "Mr. Mitnick, you have been engaging in
this conduct for too long, and no one has actually punished you.  This is the
last time you are going to do this."  She said a confidential pre-sentence
report recommended that she exceed even the 18-month maximum prison term called
for under mandatory new federal sentencing guidelines.  The judge's action
voids Mitnick's guilty plea.

Both prosecuting and defense attorneys were surprised.  Mitnick's attorney said
he did not know whether his client would agree to a guilty plea carrying a
longer prison term.  This could make it harder to bring charges against
Mitnick's alleged associates.  If Mitnick is brought to trial, testimony from
at least one of his associates would be required to convict him, and they would
not appear as witnesses without receiving immunity from prosecution.

Computer Hacker Working On Another Plea Bargain                     May 6, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Excerpts from the Los Angeles Herald Examiner

Attorneys said yesterday they are negotiating a second plea bargain for
computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, whose first offer to plead guilty was scuttled
by a judge because it called for too little time in prison.

Mitnick, 25, of Panorama City, California offered in March to serve one year in
prison and to plead guilty to computer fraud and possessing unauthorized
long-distance telephone codes.

Mitnick Update                                                     May 10, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Excerpts taken from the Los Angeles Times

When last we heard about Kevin Mitnick, the hacker once called "as dangerous
with a keyboard as a bank robber with a gun," the judge, Judge Mariana
Pfaelzer, had rejected a plea bargain as too lenient, saying Mitnick deserved
more than the agreed one year of jail time [see above articles].

According to more recent information, Mitnick has now reached a new agreement,
with no agreed-upon prison sentence.  He pleaded guilty to stealing a DEC
security program and illegal possession of 16 long-distance telephone codes
belonging to MCI Telecommunications Corp.  The two charges carry a maximum of
15 years and a $500,000 fine.  The government agreed to lift telephone
restrictions placed on Mitnick since he was jailed in December, 1988.

At DEC's request, Mitnick will help the firm identify and fix holes in its
security software to protect itself from other hackers.  He will also cooperate
in the government's probe of Leonard DiCicco, a fellow hacker.  (DiCicco is the
"friend" who turned Mitnick in.)

Kenneth Siani Speaks Out About Kevin Mitnick                       May 23, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kevin Mitnick, the hacker "so dangerous that he can't even be allowed to use a
phone."  "He could ruin your life with his keyboard."  "Armed with a keyboard
and considered dangerous."

These are some of the things that have been said about this person.  All of
this media hype would be fine if it just sold newspapers.  But it has done much
more then just sell a few papers. It has influenced those that will ultimately
decide his fate.  I myself do not know the man, but I have talked to others
that do.  Including one of the persons that investigated Mitnick.  From all I
have heard about him, I think he is a slime ball!  But even a slime ball should
not be railroaded into a prison sentence that others of equal or greater guilt
have avoided.

I personally feel the man is just a criminal, like the guy that robs a 7/11, no
better but certainly not any worse.  Unfortunately he is thought of as some
kind of a "SUPER HACKER."  The head of Los Angeles Police Dept's Computer Crime
Unit is quoted as saying, "Mitnick is several levels above what you would
characterize as a computer hacker."

No disrespect intended, but a statement like this from the head of a computer
crime unit indicates his ignorance on the ability of hackers and phone phreaks.
Sure he did things like access and perhaps even altered Police Department
criminal records, credit records at TRW Corp, and Pacific Telephone,
disconnecting phones of people he didn't like etc.  But what is not understood
by most people outside of the hack/phreak world is that these things are VERY
EASY TO DO AND ARE DONE ALL THE TIME.  In the hack/phreak community such
manipulation of computer and phone systems is all to easy.  I see nothing
special about his ability to do this.  The only thing special about Kevin
Mitnick is that he is not a "novice" hacker like most of the thirteen year old
kids that get busted for hacking/phreaking.  It has been a number of years
since an "advanced" hacker has been arrested.  Not since the days of the Inner
Circle gang have law enforcement authorities had to deal with a hacker working
at this level of ability.  As a general rule, advanced hackers do not get
caught because of there activity but rather it is almost always others that
turn them in.  It is therefore easy to understand why his abilities are
perceived as being extraordinary when in fact they are not.

Because of all the media hype this case has received I'm afraid that:

1.) He will not be treated fairly. He will be judged as a much greater threat
    to society then others that have committed similar crimes.

2.) He will become some kind of folk hero.  A Jesse James with a keyboard.
    This will only cause other to follow in his footsteps.

I'm not defending him or the things he has done in any sense.  All I'm saying
is let's be fair.  Judge the man by the facts, not the headlines.

Disclaimer:  The views expressed here are my own.

Computer Intrusion Network in Detroit                              May 25, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from the San Jose Mercury News (Knight-Ridder News Service)

DETROIT -- Secret Service agents smashed what they described as a costly,
sophisticated computer intrusion network on Wednesday, May 24, and were
surprised to discover it made up largely of teen-agers.

The computer systems of more than 20 companies including the Michigan
Department of Treasury, Home Box Office cable television services, [and RCA]
were infiltrated, according to agents serving search warrants across the
country.

Federal officials said the infiltrations by the network represented fraud of
$200,000 to $1.5 million in appropriated goods, telephone and computer time.

Agents expected to arrest some adults when they swept down on eight people who
allegedly ran the network in several states.  Instead, they found only one
adult, in Chicago.  The rest were teen-agers as young as 14:  Two in Columbus,
Ohio; two in Boston, Massachusetts; two in Sterling Heights, Michigan [The
Outsider and The Untouchable]; and one in Atlanta, Georgia.  Agents expected to
make another arrest in Los Angeles.

Officials said at least 55 other people nationwide made use of the network's
information.

In Sterling Heights, Secret Service agents pulled two eighth-grader boys, both
14, out of school and questioned them in the presence of their parents, who
apparently were unaware of their activities.  James Huse, special agent in
charge of the U.S. Secret Service office in Detroit, said the youths admitted
involvement in the scheme.

He said the eight-graders, because they are juveniles, cannot be charged under
federal law and will be dealt with by local juvenile authorities.

Authorities believe the mastermind is Lynn Doucett, 35, of Chicago.  She was
arrested Wednesday, May 24, and is cooperating with authorities, Huse said.

Doucett, who was convicted in Canada of telecommunications fraud, supports
herself and two children through her computer intrusion activities, which
include using stolen or counterfeit credit cards for cash advances or money
orders, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court.

If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

HR 1504 -- Beeper Abuse Prevention Act                             May 22, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 "Pagers Don't Commit Crimes, Congressmen Do."

The fools in congress assembled are at it again.  Three years in jail for
selling a pager to a minor?  If you didn't believe when Abbie Hoffman said that
the drug hysteria was just an excuse for more control of the citizens, think
again.

In USA Today was a "face-off" on the issues.  According to this article,
Representative Kweisi Mfume (D-Md) says the following:

     "The drug business is using the  latest technology to promote its
     deadly trade.  One such advance, the paging device, or beeper, is
     now appearing in classrooms and schoolyards.  I have introduced the
     Beeper Abuse Prevention Act to curtail the use of beepers by young
     people who deal drugs.  It would require the Federal Communications
     Commission to prescribe regulations that would restrict the
     possession and use of paging devices by persons under age 21.

     Law officers say dealers and suppliers send coded messages via
     beeper to youths in school.  The codes translate into messages like
     "meet me at our regular place after class to pick up the drugs."
     Drug traffickers are even using 800 numbers now available with
     regional paging services.  A supplier could actually conduct a
     transaction in Baltimore from Miami, for example.

     My bill, H.R. 1504, would require any person selling or renting
     paging devices to verify the identification and age of every
     customer; encourage parents and businesses to take more
     responsibility in their children's or employees' activities; make
     it unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully rent, sell or
     use paging devices in violation of rules prescrived by the FCC
     (there are provisions for stiff fines and up to three-year prison
     terms for adults who illegally provide beepers to youths); and
     require parents or businesses who allow the use of beepers to state
     that intention with and affidavit at the time of purchase."

He goes on to say that he recognizes that there are legitimate uses of beepers,
but we can no longer stand by and watch drugs flow into our neighborhoods.  The
opposite side is taken by Lynn Scarlett, from Santa Monica, CA.  She asks what
beepers have to do with the drug trade, and regulating their use will not put a
dent it it.  She also says that there is little evidence that gun control keeps
guns out of the hands of gangsters, and it will take a good dose of wizardry to
keep beepers away from bad guys.  She finishes with:

     "The logic of the Beeper Abuse Prevention Act opens the door for
     laws to make us sign promises that we won't, we swear, use these
     things for illicit acts when we buy them.  De Tocqueville, that
     eminent observer of our nation, warned that our loss of freedom
     would sneak in through passage of quiet, seemingly innocuous and
     well-intended laws -- laws like H.R. 1504.

Computer Threat Research Association (UK)                        March 31, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For those of you interested an umbrella organization has been established in
the United Kingdom to coordinate information on, and research into, all aspects
of computer security.  In the first instance one of the organization's primary
concerns will be combatting the threat posed by computer viruses by acting as a
clearing house for virus information and control software.

Below is a copy of an initial letter mailed to prospective members:

                   The Computer Threat Research Association

The computer threat research association, CoTra is a non-profit making
organization that exists to research, analyze, publicize and find solutions
for threats to the integrity and reliability of computer systems.

The issue that caused the formation of CoTra was the rise of the computer
virus.  This problem has since become surrounded by fear, uncertainty and
doubt.  To the average user, the computer virus and its implications are a
worry of an unknown scale.  To a few unfortunates whose systems have become
victims, it is a critical issue.

The key advantage of CoTra membership will be access to advice and information.
Advice will be provided through publications, an electronic conference (a
closed conference for CoTra's members has been created on the Compulink CIX
system) as well as other channels such as general postings direct to members
when a new virus is discovered.

CoTra membership will be available on a student, full or corporate member
basis.  All software that is held by CoTra that enhances system reliability,
such as virus detection and removal software, will be available to all members.
It is intended to establish discounts with suppliers of reliability tools and
services.  A library of virus sources and executables and other dangerous
research material will be made available to members who have a demonstrable
need.

A register of consultants who have specific skills in the systems reliability
field will be published by CoTra and reviews of reliability enhancing software
will be produced.

Your support of CoTra will ensure that you have the earliest and most accurate
information about potential threats to your computer systems.

Strange Customs Service Clock Department                            May 1, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Written by Vanessa Jo Grimm (Goverment Computer News)(Page 6)

The U.S. attorney for Washington is reviewing an allegation that a Customs
Service official violated the Computer Security Act [PL 100-235 presumably] by
altering a computer's internal clock.

Treasury Department Inspector General Michael R. Hill referred the allegation
to the prosecutor after an investigation into year-end spending by Custom
officials at the close of Fiscal Year 1988.  The allegation involves an
official who may have authorized altering the date maintained by the computers
that the agency uses for procurement documents, according to Maurice S. Moody,
the Inspector General's audit director for Financial Management Service.

Moody recently told the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight the
computers are part of the agency's Automated Commercial System.  He declined to
provide Government Computer News with more details.

Allegedly the computer clock was rolled back during the first three days of
October of 1988 so that $41.8 million in procurement obligations would be dated
in September against fiscal year 1988 appropriations, Moody said.

An inspector general report issued in late February concluded Customs had not
violated any procurement laws.  The inspector general's investigation is
continuing, however.

"Doesn't $41.8 million worth of procurement on the last day of the fiscal year
bother anybody?" asked Rep. Richard T. Shulze (R-Pa).  The purchases did bother
the inspector general, Moody said, and this concern led to getting the United
State attorney attorney.  "This problem is endemic in the federal government,"
he said.  "Year-end spending is very common."

William F. Riley, Customs controller, said he knew about the rollback, but he
and Deputy Commissioner Michael H. Lane refused to say who authorized the
action...  Subcommittee members continued to press Riley and Lane.  "Is the
person still at Customs?" asked subcommittee chairman J. J. Pickle (D-Texas).
He is working full time and in the position he was at the time," Lane answered.

Rep. Beryl F. Anthony, Jr. (D-Ark) asked how Riley became aware of the
rollback.  "He (the official who authorized the rollback) told me that it was
going to be done," Riley said.

Rep. Pickle suggested that a high ranking official would have to authorize such
an action, but Counsel advised Lane not to reply.  He did say neither he nor
Commissioner von Raab had made the decision.

The balance of the article deals with the actions of Linda Gibbs, who became
aware of the incident and reported it to the inspector general after being
unable to stop the action.  Gibbs also alleged that the action was intended to
use available year-end money to cover cost overrun on a contract with Northrop
Corp.  She also alleged that she had been reassigned and given no new duties.

Robert T. Morris Suspended From Cornell                            May 25, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from the New York Times

Cornell University has suspended the graduate student identified by school
officials as the author of "the Internet worm."

In a May 16th letter to Robert Tappan Moris, age 23, the dean of the Cornell
University Graduate School said a university panel had found him guilty of
violating the school's Code of Academic Integrity.

He will be suspended until the beginning of the fall semester of 1990, and then
could reapply.

No criminal charges have been filed against Morris.  A federal grand jury this
year forwarded its recommendations to the Justice Department, which has not
taken any action.

Justice Department Wary in Computer Case                           May 28, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Matthew Spina (Syracuse Herald-American)

              "Is Washington Fearful Of Losing A Landmark Trial?"

Some computer experts theorize that the Justice Department, afraid of bungling
what could become a landmark computer case, still doesn't know how to treat the
Cornell student whose computer worm slithered nationwide in November, 1988.

A further concern in Washington:  A trial in the case might embarrass the
Department of Defense if its scientists are asked to detail how their computers
were among the thousands crippled by the worm.

For several months, the decision on how to charge 23-year-old Robert T. Morris,
Jr. had been before Mark Richard, a deputy assistant attorney general.  Within
the last few weeks, Richard made a decision that now is being reviewed by an
assistant attorney general, according to a computer professional who has been
talking with the Justice Department.

"I thought we would have heard something from Washington by now," said Andrew
Baxtoer, the assistant U.S. attorney who in November and December presented the
case to a grand jury in Syracuse.

The grand jury's report was sent on the the Justice Department, which refuses
to comment publicly on the matter because Morris has not been indicted.

"Within the next two weeks I assume that a decision will be made," said one
official.

"If they decide to begin an expensive trial, they have to make sure they win so
as not to damage future attempts to prosecute under that law," said Eugene H.
Spafford, an assistant professor at Purdue University whose analysis of the
worm has helped federal investigators.  "If they decide not to prosecute, and
the total thing that happens is he gets suspended (from Cornell), I will be
outraged."

So far, Cornell has taken the only disciplinary measure against Morris,
suspending him for the 1989-90 academic year.  But the graduate student left
the computer science department early in November, the day after the worm
spread out of a computer in Upson Hall.

Morris, a computer science graduate student, has been called the author of a
rogue computer program, called a worm, that was spread from a Cornell
University computer.  The program was designed to reproduce and infect any
computer linked to the Internet, a network shared by colleges, research centers
and military institutions.

However, experts say an error caused the program to replicate out of control,
sending thousands of copies into thousands of computers.

If Morris is to be charged with a felony, prosecutors would then have to show
he intended to destroy or extract information.

Proving that would be difficult since the program neither destroyed nor removed
information from any computer.

To convict Morris on most lesser charges, prosecutors would have to show he
intended to harm computers.

Prosecutors also could use a misdemeanor charge requiring them to prove only
that Morris gained access to a federal government computer. The worm did reach
computers at the Army Ballistics Research Laboratory and NASA's Langley
Research Center, among others.

Some computer experts wonder, though, if Defense Department officials will be
reluctant to testify publicly about how their computers were penetrated -- even
those computers holding non-classified information. In February, at a computer
convention in San Diego, Defense Department computer experts detailed some
security improvements made to the network since November, but then refused to
release copies of their presentation to people at the seminar.

The FBI -- which enforces the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 -- and some
people in the computer industry are pushing for a vigorous prosecution to
display a strong case against computer hacking.  Others in the industry,
including some of Morris' friends from Harvard University and Cornell, urge
leniency because he was trying to demonstrate security flaws with computers.

What's Happening:  Computer Security Up                            June 4, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from Gannett Westchester Newspapers

                   [Comments in brackets from Delta-Master]

High-tech companies are spending 64% more [than they previously spent] on
computer security, according to a recent survey conducted by the National
Center for Computer Crime Data in Los Angeles.  The group surveyed 3,500 law
enforcement agencies and computer security experts about computer crime.  The
prosecution rate is also up -- 6.4% in 1988 from only 2.4% during 1987.

Contrary to popular image, computer hackers aren't always young boys.  The
study found that 32% of those arrested for computer crimes were female, while
only 14% were under 21.  The study said 45% of hackers were 25 to 30 years old.

I do not know about you people, but the public's confusion about hackers starts
to bother me when they make errors.  Seriously, I know of only a few hackers
over the age of 21.  The fact that the newspapers also equate the thug-like
computer criminals with the mastermind-criminal type hacker (you guys) is also
pretty annoying, wouldn't you agree?  One key phrase you must note: "32% OF
THOSE ARRESTED."  Oh well, such are the mistakes of newspapers.

Public Service Commission Bans Operator Companies                April 24, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Jerri Stroud (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)

The Missouri Public Service Commission voted 4-1 last week to ban providers of
so-called alternative operator services in Missouri because allowing the
companies to operate is "not in the public interest."

Alternative operator services companies contract with hotels, motels colleges,
hospitals, airports, restaurants and other facilities to provide operator
assistance to customers using pay telephones or house phones.  Consumer groups
have complained about price-gouging by the companies nationwide.

Mark Wheatley, a lawyer for the Office of Public Council, praised the
commission's decision.

The Office of Public Council has received numerous complaints about excessive
rates and surcharges by alternative operator services companies, said Wheatley.
Some alternative operator services companies also have accepted other
companies' credit cards without authorization from the companies issuing the
cards, he said.

"We feel that it's an extremely important decision by the commission." said
Wheatley.  But he said he expects the companies affected by the ruling to
appeal.

Lawyers for the alternative operator services companies could not be reached
for comment.

In it's ruling, the commission said many consumers aren't aware of the rates
charged by the alternative operator services companies until they receive "a
bill for operator services at prices higher than those to which he is
accustomed."  Consumer groups say the rates often are twice or three times the
rates charged by better-known long-distance companies.

Even if an operator service company identifies itself when a consumer makes a
call, the commission said many consumers don't understand the significance of
the identification.

"If the end user is not educated as to the intricacies of using an alternative
operator services provider, he does not truly have a meaningful choice..." the
commission said.

The ruling only affects intrastate calls handled by alternative operator
services companies, but it may effectively prevent the companies from providing
interstate service as well.

The commission specifically denied tariff requests from International
Telecharge Inc. and American Operator Services Inc.  The commission also
directed three other companies -- Teleconnect Inc., Dial US, and Dial USA -- to
file new tariffs consistent with the ruling.

The ruling allows companies to operate who provide operator services in
connection with their business -- long-distance carriers and local telephone
companies, for example.  But the commission also placed limits on these
companies.

Under the ruling, operator services companies must:

     * Identify themselves to the caller as well as to the party being billed
       by the call (in the case of a collect or third-party call).

     * Quote rates to the caller or billed party on request, without charge.

     * Use calling card verification procedures acceptable to the companies
       issuing the cards.

     * Post in a prominent position the company's name, detailed complaint
       procedures and instruction on how to reach the local telephone company
       operator and other long-distance carriers.

     * Transfer emergency traffic to the local telephone company or American
       Telephone & Telegraph Co. until the alternative services provider can
       show that it can handle emergency calls adequately.

Fax Attack                                                         May 13, 1989

       "Governor's Attempt To Ban Unsolicited Advertisements Backfires!"

HARTFORD, Conn - The great fax attack of 1989 -- an all-out lobbying campaign
against a bill banning unsolicited facsimile advertising -- may have backfired
when the governor's fax machine was jammed for hours with unwanted messages.

Starting Thursday, May 11, and continuing Friday, May 12, Governor William A.
O'Neill's fax machine has been beeping constantly, spitting out unwanted
messages from angry businesses that advertise by fax.

The businesses oppose a bill now awaiting O'Neill's signature that would
prohibit them from marketing their products by fax without first obtaining the
permission of the recipient.  Violators would face a $200 fine.

Starting Thursday morning, dozens of Connecticut businesses faxed to O'Neill's
office a form letter arguing against the fax ban.  The stream of fax messages
was so constant (40 came in before 10 AM) that the governor's office turned off
the fax machine Thursday (May 11).

O'Neill's press secretary, Jon. L. Sandberg, said the governor still hasn't
decided whether he will sign the bill.  But aides to the governor said the
persistent lobbying campaign proved how annoying unwanted messages can be.  The
inconvenience was compounded because the governor's office was unable to use
its fax machine to receive information about spring flooding around the state.

NYNEX Announces Info-Look Gateway                                April 28, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Introducing a new service for accessing information and more... all through
your personal computer!

Starting in May 1989, New York Telephone's INFO-LOOK (tm) Gateway Service can
be your link to accessing a variety of information, products and services.

The INFO-LOOK Gateway simplifies on-line computer access to a variety of
information providers.  When you call the Gateway phone number through your
modem, you'll be able to scan a menu of information services.

The types of information services you may choose from include:  Entertainment,
business, health, food, news, weather, sports, travel, government, educational
and reference information.  The services, some interactive, are provided by
independent companies.

The INFO-LOOK Gateway is easy to use -- even if you're relatively new to using
a PC.

What you'll need to use the INFO-LOOK Gateway

1.  Virtually any type of personal computer.

2.  A modem (300, 1200, or 2400 Baud), and communications software.  This
    enables your computer to communicate with other computers via the telephone
    system.

3.  A New York Telephone Calling Card.  If you need a New York Telephone
    Calling Card, (it's FREE), call your service representative whose number
    appears on page one of your New York Telephone bill.

Charges for using the INFO-LOOK Gateway

There are ** no ** Gateway enrollment fees and ** no ** monthly subscription
charges.  In most cases, you will be charged (New York people only):

o  A local call to reach the INFO-LOOK Gateway.

o  While you're browsing the Gateway directory of services, or moving between
   services, you pay $.05 a minute.

o  Once you connect to a service, the charge is determined by the Service
   Provider.  Some services have a per-minute usage charge.  Some services are
   free.  The charges for each service are listed in the Gateway menu.

You'll find most charges itemized on your monthly New York Telephone bill.
Some Service Providers may decide to bill you separately and directly for use
of their services.

Pacific Bell Plans Access To Computers                             June 9, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from Santa Cruz Sentinel (Section B)

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pacific Bell said Thursday it hopes to compete with the
popularity of television by offering people easy access to computerized
libraries, bulletin boards and the use of electronic mail.

PacBell's California On-line -- which will be available to anybody with a
personal computer, telephone and calling card -- will be among the first in the
nation to use a graphic-based system that simplifies procedures so only a
rudimentary familiarity with computers is needed.

"It's going to offer our customers a supplement to their current leisure
activities... and among other things we've seen (in trials) a lot of people
who got away from the TV," said Roger P. Conrad, director of Videotex Gateway
Services.

"We feel this is a more productive way for people to spend their lives and we
think a lot of users are going to agree," he added.  Users will pay
"info-entrepreneurs" fees based on the time they use various services and will
be billed on their monthly telephone statements.  Unlike some on-line
information services, users do not have to subscribe ahead of time.

Conrad said the types of services are limited only by vendors' imaginations.
PacBell will make money by selling telecommunication line use to the companies.

One of Cliff Stoll's "Wily Hackers" Is Dead (Suicide?)             June 5, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
According to West German publications, the "Wily Hacker" Karl Koch, of
Hannover, West Germany, died Friday, June 3, probably by suicide.  His body was
found burnt (with gasoline) to death, in a forest near Celle (a West German
town near Hannover where he committed his hacks, as had been observed by German
Post).

Koch was one of the 2 hackers who confessed their role in the KGB hack to the
public prosecutors, therewith bringing the case to public attention.  As German
newspapers report, he probably suffered from a psychic disease:  He thought he
was permanently observed by alien beings named Illimunates' which tried to kill
him.  Probably, he had internalized the role of "Captain Hagbard" (his
pseudonym in the hacking scene), taken from a U.S. book, who (like him)
suffered from supervision by the Illuminates. Police officials evidently think
that Koch committed suicide (though it is believed, that there are "some
circumstances" which may also support other theories; no precise information
about such moments are reported).

According to German police experts, Karl Koch's role in the KGB case as in
daily life can properly be understood when reading this unknown book.

Illuminatus!                                                      June 14, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The book in question is believed to be "Illuminatus!" by Harold Shea and Robert
Anton Wilson.  The book is a spoof on conspiracy theories, and suggests that
many and probably all human institutions are just fronts for a small group of
"enlightened ones," who are themselves a front for the Time dwarves from
Reticuli Zeta, or perhaps Atlantean Adepts, remnants of Crowley's Golden Dawn,
or even more likely the Lloigor of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  A leading
character in this book is named Hagbard Celine.

"Illuminatus!" is a fun read if you like psychedelia and paranoia.  It also
seems to have influenced a lot of subsequent work, most notably Adams'
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."  It is easy to see how an unbalanced mind,
taking it literally, could be completely absorbed.  In fact "Illuminatus!"
seems as if it was written with the intent of just this sort of programming,
referring to it as "Operation Mindfuck."

This is probably not a real danger for the vast majority of sane adults, but it
may, tragically, have been the case here.  Or perhaps, no disrespect intended,
Koch may in the course of various hacks really have discovered too much about
the Illuminati.  After all, they are supposed to be the secret power behind the
KGB :-)

Sex Put On Probation By Mystery Hacker                            June 13, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ft. Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel

      "Yes, you sound very sexy, but I really need a probation officer."

DELRAY BEACH, Fla. -- Callers trying to dial a probation office in Delray
Beach, Fla on Monday, June 12, heard a smorgasbord of sex talk from a panting
woman named Tina instead.

Southern Bell telephone officials said a computer hacker reprogrammed their
equipment over the weekend, routing overflow calls intended for the local
probation office to a New York-based phone sex line.

"People are calling the Department of Corrections and getting some kind of sex
palace," said Thomas Salgluff, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County probation
office.

Southern Bell officials said it was the first time their switching equipment has
been reprogrammed by an outside computer intruder.  Southern Bell provides
local telephone service in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South
Carolina.

"We're very alarmed," said Southern Bell spokesman Buck Passmore.  He said such
a feat would require someone with considerable computer knowledge.

The implications of such a computer breach are considerable.  Intercepting
corporate communications, uncovering unlisted phone numbers, and tampering with
billing information are all plausible consequences of computer security
breaches at the the phone company.

Hackers have invaded Southern Bell in the past, but they have never
reprogrammed a telephone link, Passmore said.

Security technicians from Southern Bell and AT&T are trying to trace the source
of the computer breach, Passmore said.

Hacking For A Competitive Edge                                     May 12, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from the Los Angeles Times

Two former Tampa, FLA TV news managers have been charged with illegally tapping
into phone lines and computers at another station to gain a news edge over
their competitors.  Former new director Terry Cole and assistant news director
Michael Shapiro at WTSP-TV have been charged with 17 counts of computer hacking
and conspiracy in the theft of information from WTVT-TV through computer phone
lines, authorities said.  Their arraignment was set for May 19.

If convicted, each could face a maximum prison sentence of 85 years.  The two
were fired from WTSP when the station learned of the alleged thefts.  The
break-ins began in November, 1988, but were not noticed until January 12, 1989,
when WTVT's morning news producer noticed that files were missing, authorities
said.

Computer experts determined that an intruder had rifled the files.  Authorities
said Shapiro knew WTVT's security system thoroughly because he had helped set
it up while working there as an assignment manager before being hired away from
WTVT in October.

TV News Executives Fired After Hacking Charges From Rival
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tampa, Fla. -- A Florida television station fired two news executives in the
wake of reports that one of them allegedly penetrated a rival station's
computer system and stole sensitive information.

WTSP-TV (Channel 10), an ABC affiliate in St. Petersburg, announced that it had
fired Assistant News Director Michael Shapiro and News Director Terry Cole.

Shapiro was arrested on February 7th on felony charges for allegedly breaking
into a computer system at WTVT-TV (Channel 13) on at least six occasions in
January.  He was once employed by WTVT as an assistant manager and was
responsible for administering the station's computer systems.

Law enforcement officials seized from Shapiro's home a personal computer, 200
floppy disks and an operating manual and user guide for software used at the
rival station.

He has been charged with 14 felony counts under Florida Statute 815, which
covers computer-related crimes.  Each count carries a maximum sentence sentence
of 15 years and a $10,000 fine.

Vince Barresi, WSTP's vice-president and general manager, refused to comment on
the two firings.  However, in a prepared statement, he said that he told
viewers during an 11 PM newscast last Tuesday that the station acted to "avoid
any questions about the objective way we do our business in keeping the public
informed."

Cole, who hired Shapiro last September, has not been charged by Florida law
enforcement officials.  He was fired, according to one source, because as
director of the news room operations, he is held ultimately for the actions of
news staffers.  Shapiro and Cole were unavailable for comment.

On Rival's Files" (February 8, 1989).  It appeared in Phrack World News Issue

National Crime Information Center Leads To Repeat False Arrest     May 14, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by James Rainey (Los Angeles Times)

Mix ups with the databases at the NCIC have caused Roberto Perales Hernandez to
be jailed twice in the last three years as a suspect in a 1985 Chicago
residential burglary.  The authorities confused him with another Roberto
Hernandez due to a single entry in the FBI's National Crime Information Center
computer.

The two Roberto Hernandezes are the same height, about the same weight, have
brown hair, brown eyes, tattoos on their left arms, share the same birthday,
and report Social Security numbers which differ by only one digit!

The falsely imprisoned man has filed suit charging the Hawthorne, California
Police Department, Los Angeles County, and the state of California with false
imprisonment, infliction of emotional distress, and civil rights violations
stemming from the most recent arrest last year.

He had previously received a $7,000 settlement from the county for holding him
12 days in 1986 before realizing he was the wrong man.  In the latest incident,
he was held for seven days then freed with no explanation.

Another False Incarceration                                        May 18, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In his testimony on May 18, 1989 to the Subcommittee on Civil and
Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of
Representatives, relating to the National Crime Information Center, David D.
Redell cited another case of false incarceration concerning Roberto Perales
Hernandez as well as various cases noted earlier -- such as that of Terry Dean
Rogan [see below]:

     "Only last week, a case in California demonstrated the potential
     benefit of easy access to stored images.  Joseph O. Robertson had
     been arrested, extradited, charged, and sent to a state mental
     facility for 17 months.  During that entire time, mug shots and
     fingerprints were already on file showing clearly that he was the
     wrong man, but no one had taken the trouble to check them."

These articles show clear examples of the damage and problems caused by this
"super" database.  People like William Bayse (Federal Bureau of Investigation's
Director For Technical Services) and William Sessions (Director of the FBI)
either fail to realize this or perhaps they just do not care (as long as
something similar does not happen to them).

For those of you who are interested in looking into this further, the first
article about this NCIC database was; "'Big Brotherish' Data Base Assailed,"
(November 21, 1988).  It appeared in Phrack World News Issue XXII/Part 3.

Another incident similar to the cases mentioned above concerned Richard
Lawrence Sklar, a political science professor at the University of California
at Los Angeles.  He was mistaken by the computer for a fugitive wanted in a
real estate scam in Arizona.  Before the FBI figured out that they had the
incorrect person, Sklar, age 58, spent two days being strip searched, herded
from one holding pen to another, and handcuffed to gang members and other
violent offenders.  For more details on this case and the case concerning Terry
Dean Rogan, please refer to "FBI National Crime Information Center Data Bank,"
(February 13, 1989) which appeared in Phrack World News Issue XXIV/Part 2 (as
well as the Washington Post).

TRW and Social Security Administration                             May 12, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The credit bureau of TRW has been working with the Social Security
Administration to verify its database of 140 million names and Social Security
numbers.  In order to cover the cost, TRW is paying the Social Security
Administration $1 million, while Social Security Administration will provide a
matching $1 million.

Since the Social Security Administration is asking for a budget increase for
their computer and telecommunications systems, several legislators are outraged
by the fact they they are spending $1 million for this non-government project.
Claiming that the project is "as far away from the mission of the Social
Security Administration as anything I have ever come across," Senator David
Pryor (D-Ark) questioned the competence and credibility of Social Security
Administration Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy and asked for an investigation by
the HHS inspector general.

In addition, several lawmakers such as Dale Bumpers (D-Ark) believe the project
to be a violation of civil liberties. Said Bumpers, "I don't like any public
institution releasing an individual's private information."  The American Law
Division of the Congressional Research Service has already concluded that the
project is a violation of the Privacy Act of 1974.

Phrack World News XXVII Quicknotes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  The current name assigned to the new network being created by the merger
    of BITNET and CSNET is ONENET.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  NPA 903 Assigned to NE Texas (May 10, 1989) -- It was just announced that
    those portions of 214 outside Dallas will be changed to 903 in the Fall of
    1990.

    With 708 assigned to Chicago, 903 assigned to Texas, and 908 assigned to
    New Jersey, only 909 and 917 remain to be assigned before the format
    changes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Details On New Area Code 510 (June 6, 1989) -- The press release from
    Pacific Bell, quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle, gives the phase-in
    dates for the new NPA 510.

    Inception is scheduled for October 7, 1991, with a four-month grace period
    when NPA 415 will still work for the affected numbers.  Final cutover is
    scheduled for January 27, 1992.

    NPA 510 will encompass Alameda and Contra Costa counties, which currently
    have 842,388 customers out of the current 2,005,687 customers in NPA 415.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. New Jersey Area Code To Be Split (April 27, 1989) -- The split is not
   supposed to occur until 1991.  The new NPA will be 908 and it will basically
   cover the southern "half" of the current 201 area.  The affected counties
   will be Warren, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Union, Monmouth and Ocean, and the
   southwest corner of Morris).  Counties remaining in 201 will be Sussex,
   Passaic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson, and the majority of Morris.

   New Jersey Bell will also start requiring area codes on calls into New York
   and Pennsylvania that have been considered part of New Jersey local calling
   areas.  This will apparently take effect October 2 and free up about 25
   exchanges.  Information from the Asbury Park Press.

       [This last line somewhat contradicts the first line as far as the
       dates are concerned.  More information as we get it.      -- KL.]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. New Area Codes For London (April 27, 1989) -- British Telecom has announced
   that the area code for London is to be changed on May 6th, 1990, due to the
   increased number of lines needed in the capital.

   The existing code is 01-, and the new codes to be introduced are 071- for
   the centre of the city and 081- for the suburbs.  A list was published in
   the Evening Standard, showing which exchanges will fall in which area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Member Learns The Hard Way:  American Express Is Watching (May 4, 1989) --
    This article taken from the San Jose Mercury News describes how American
    Express called a member to voice their concern that he might not be able to
    pay his recent bill.  American Express was able to access his checking
    account and find that he had less than what was owed to them.  His card was
    temporarily "deactivated" after the member refused to give any financial
    information except that he would pay up the bill with cash when it came in.

    Apparently, the card application, in finer print, declares that "[American
    Express reserves] the right to access accounts to ascertain whether you are
    able to pay the balance."  After some arguments with the company, the
    member comments that "I learned a lesson:  My life is not as private as I
    thought."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Southwestern Bell's QuickSource (April 24, 1989) -- Southwestern Bell
    Telephone Company is running a one year trial (March 1989 89 - March 1990)
    of two information services:  QuickSource (audiotex) and Sourceline
    (videotext).  The latter requires a terminal of some type, but the former
    only requires a touch-tone phone for access.  The QuickSource number is
    323-2000, but cannot be accessed via 1+713+; SWBTCo has blocked access to
    "the Houston metro area served by SWBTCo," according to the script the
    woman reads to you when ask for help (713-865-5777; not blocked).  The help
    desk will send you a free QuickSource directory though.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Telemail, MCI, AT&T Mail Interconnection (May 16, 1989) -- U.S. Sprint's
    subsidiary, Telenet has announced an interconnection agreement between
    Telemail, Telenet's electronic mail product, MCI Mail, and AT&T Mail.

    The new arrangement, scheduled to be in effect later this summer, will
    allow the 300,000 worldwide users of Telemail, the 100,000 users of MCI
    Mail and the 50,000 users of AT&T Mail to conveniently send email messages
    to each other.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Illinois Bell Knocked Out For Four Hours! (May 18,1989) -- Service to over
    40,000 Illinois Bell subscribers in the northwest suburbs of Chicago was
    disrupted for about four hours because of problems with the computer in the
    switching center.

    Phones were either dead or inoperative for incoming and outgoing calls
    between 9:30 a.m. and 1:40 p.m. because of a software glitch at the central
    office in Hoffman Estates, IL.  Most of the disruption occurred in Hoffman
    Estates, Schaumburg, Arlington Heights, Hanover Park, and Streamwood, IL.

    The exact nature of the problem was not discussed by the Bell spokesman who
    reported that the outage had been corrected.  Apparently the backup system
    which is supposed to kick in also failed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. SRI Attacked By Kamikaze Squirrels (May 29, 1989) -- It seems that the Data
    Defense Network SRI's "no-single-point-of-failure" power system failed at
    the hands, or rather the paws, of a squirrel.  The power was off for
    approximately 9 hours and they experienced no hardware problems.  This was
    at least the third time that a squirrel has done SRI in.

11. New York Telephone Freebies (June 10, 1989)(San Francisco Chronicle, p. 2.)
    -- 24 pay phones along the Long Island Expressway were in fact free phones
    because of a programming/database screw-up.  They were being heavily used
    for long distance calls by those who had discovered the oversight,
    including many to Pakistan (Police found 15 Pakistani men using the phones
    when they went to investigate after a shooting).  There were no estimates
    on the unrecovered cost of the phone calls.
