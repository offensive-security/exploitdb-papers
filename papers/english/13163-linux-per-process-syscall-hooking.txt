1. Introduction

This document describes a new syscall hooking technique for Linux systems and
exposes how it can be implemented as part of a virus or a backdoor in order to
take full control over an userland application. Although there are some well-
known methods for hooking functions, they are mostly based on the ELF format
itself. This technique is focused on thoses pieces of code that are externally
called by the main program and invoke a system call or system service.

A simple implementation of this hooking mechanism has been developed as a result
of the research and it is included with the article. This code provided does not
have all the features you wish but includes the required ones, is not a real
backdoor but a simple proof of concept, perfect to write your own one.


2. Function Wrapping

This section contains a brief description of the libc syscall wrapping
mechanism and how it works, if you have not ever heard of this or you need
for more information you should read the libc code and check the manual [3].

The GNU C library (glibc) provides a complete interface to request system
services through a set of functions called syscall wrappers. These functions
are used by userland programmers to execute syscalls and not be worried about
the inner mechanism of services invocation. Each system service has its own
wrapper code associated and is placed in the libc shared object.
The following is the disassembly of the mprotect() syscall wrapper:

    53              push ebx
    8b542410        mov edx, [esp+10h]
    8b4c240c        mov ecx, [esp+0ch]
    8b5c2408        mov ebx, [esp+8]
    b87d000000      mov eax, 7dh
    cd80            int 80h
    5b              pop ebx
    3d01f0ffff      cmp eax, 0fffff001h
    7301            jnc loc_b54ad
    c3              ret
    53              push ebx
    e87efdf5ff      call sub_15231
    81c341eb0500    add ebx, offset_5eb41
    31d2            xor edx, edx
    29c2            sub edx, eax
    52              push edx
    e8cdfcf5ff      call sub_15190
    59              pop ecx
    5b              pop ebx
    8908            mov [eax], ecx
    83c8ff          or eax, 0ffffffffh
    ebe0            jmp loc_b54ac
    90              nop
    90              nop
    90              nop
    90              nop

This function contains lot of code that is not useful for us now, the most
significative code can be seen at the beginning. The first instructions are the
responsible for preparing and invoking the mprotect system call from userspace.
The parameters that it takes are all moved from the stack space into the
corresponding registers, then the service number is moved into eax and finally
the syscall is invoked by using one of the available "system service invocation
instruction" (traditionally, it has been the famous int80 instruction).

Although the code should be slightly different for each wrapper, they commonly
share the same pieces of code, where the most important ones are:

    1) instructions to set the parameters:

    8b542410        mov edx, [esp+10h]
    8b4c240c        mov ecx, [esp+0ch]
    8b5c2408        mov ebx, [esp+8]

    2) instruction to set the service number:

    b87d000000      mov eax, 7dh

    3) the system service invocation instruction:

    cd80            int 80h

    4) some kind of internal error handling:

    5b              pop ebx
    3d01f0ffff      cmp eax, 0fffff001h
    7301            jnc loc_b54ad

If we have a look at the libc source code we can see an include file which
contains some macros in inline assembly, it does exactly the first two parts
of the above layout. The following macro defines a general instruction used to
execute a syscall:

    # define INTERNAL_SYSCALL(name, err, nr, args...)   \
        ({  \
        register unsigned int resultvar;    \
        EXTRAVAR_##nr                       \
        asm volatile (      \
        LOADARGS_##nr           \
        "movl %1, %%eax\n\t"        \
        "int $0x80\n\t"     \
        RESTOREARGS_##nr        \
        : "=a" (resultvar)              \
        : "i" (__NR_##name) ASMFMT_##nr(args) : "memory", "cc");    \
        (int) resultvar; })

And you can see the macro above in action in the following wrapper code:

    gid_t
    __getgid (void)
    {
        INTERNAL_SYSCALL_DECL (err);
    #if __ASSUME_32BITUIDS > 0
        INTERNAL_SYSCALL (getgid, err, 0);
    #else
    #ifdef __NR_getgid32
        if (__libc_missing_32bit_uids <= 0)
        {
            int result;

            result = INTERNAL_SYSCALL (getgid32, err, 0);
            if (! INTERNAL_SYSCALL_ERROR_P (result, err)
            || INTERNAL_SYSCALL_ERRNO (result, err) != ENOSYS)
            return result;

            __libc_missing_32bit_uids = 1;
        }
    # endif /* __NR_getgid32 */
        /* No error checking.  */
        return INTERNAL_SYSCALL (getgid, err, 0);
    #endif
    }


3. Signal Handling

This section will discuss what happens on userspace when a signal handler is
invoked and especially how the execution contexts are saved and restored. The
following is not a deep description of the Linux signal internals, only those
parts that are involved in our hooking method will be showed, if you need more
information check the kernel code.

A programmer can modify the behaviour of an application by simply changing the
default action taken by the process when a specific signal is delivered. When a
process receive a signal the kernel checks if exist a handler registered for it,
if it does, then the kernel executes the function "handle_signal" which
basically does the following three steps:

    * save current context
    * set handler context
    * begin handler execution

The first step consists in saving the current execution context which comprises
the general purpose registers, among other things, at the point in which the
execution flow was interrupted by the signal. All this information is known as
"signal frame" or sigframe. This structure is used later by kernel in order to
restore the execution, so it is placed on the stack, just after the last push.
Sigframe Struct:

    (fill in by the internal kernel function "setup_Frame")
    struct sigframe
    {
        char __user *pretcode;
        int sig;
        struct sigcontext sc;
        struct _fpstate fpstate;
        unsigned long extramask[_NSIG_WORDS-1];
        char retcode[8];
    };

Where the most interesting fields are:

    * pretcode: the restorer function address, called just after signal
      handler returns. It is usually a pointer to a code that simply
      makes a call to sigreturn():

        restorer = &__kernel_sigreturn;
        if (ka->sa.sa_flags & SA_RESTORER)
               restorer = ka->sa.sa_restorer;
        /* Set up to return from userspace.  */
        err |= __put_user(restorer, &frame->pretcode);
 
    * sig: number of the delivered signal

    * sc: a sigcontext structure that contains the value of all general purpose
            registers when the program was interrupted:

        struct sigcontext {
        unsigned short gs, __gsh;
        unsigned short fs, __fsh;
        unsigned short es, __esh;
        unsigned short ds, __dsh;
        unsigned long edi;
        unsigned long esi;
        unsigned long ebp;
        unsigned long esp;
        unsigned long ebx;
        unsigned long edx;
        unsigned long ecx;
        unsigned long eax;
        unsigned long trapno;
        unsigned long err;
        unsigned long eip;
        unsigned short cs, __csh;
        unsigned long eflags;

This shows how the stack layout looks when a sigframe has been inserted
(handler prolog is not present yet):

     esp             esp
   [  |   sigframe    | --- data ---- | ebp | eip | args ]
      '---------------|                     |
       |              '---------------------'
       |               interrupted function
       |               frame
       '- restorer
         __kernel_sigreturn()

The second step consists in preparing the handler's context to be executed:

        regs->esp = (unsigned long) frame;
        regs->eip = (unsigned long) ka->sa.sa_handler;
        regs->eax = (unsigned long) sig;
        regs->edx = (unsigned long) 0;
        regs->ecx = (unsigned long) 0;

        set_fs(USER_DS);
        regs->xds = __USER_DS;
        regs->xes = __USER_DS;
        regs->xss = __USER_DS;
        regs->xcs = __USER_CS;

And finally, in the third step the execution flow came back from kernel space
and the handler is executed. Fortunately, the actions that it will do does not
affect the sigframe. Once it has finished the pretcode is loaded into eip
register and sigreturn() syscall restores the saved context.


4. Trapping syscalls

Once we have reviewed what a syscall wrapper is and what operations are involved
during a signal handling procedure we can proceed to explain the details of the
hooking mechanism.

Basically, a trapped syscall can be defined as an event notification mechanism,
used by a built-in userland syscall dispatcher. The idea is really quite
simple, just search a specific syscall wrapper and patch it with our hook, but
this hook is not the common "jmp/call" instruction which performs a flow control
transfer, but it is just a int3 instruction. As a result, each time a wrapper
code is accessed (from the main program or from a shared object) a sigtrap
signal is produced and delivered to the current process, it is catched by the
kernel and handled by an special sigtrap handler. This routine is responsible
for identifying the syscall requested and executing its associated callback
function.

Implement a syscall trapping mechanism is not really easy, it must be all coded
in assembly language because is the best way to work in the context of a runtime
process (portability problems). Also, the code should be as small as possible
(not always) and be able to performs, at least, all the following actions:

 * copy itself into the target process avoiding ASLR and similar kernel
   developer tricks
 * to have at one's disposal a good length disassembler engine
 * has symbol resolution and symbol hot-patching routines
 * has a sigtrap handler capable of dispatching syscall requests
 * optionally (but no less important) has some kind of internal error handling
   in case of crash

In fact, as you can see, it is more like a virus but is not self-propagating.
The following sections will describe some of the above features included in the
code provided and the main actions that it performs to become a hidden system
service dispatcher.

4.1. Target Process Infection

First thing the code does is just copy itself into the target process and, to
achieve that, it uses the ptrace interface available on Linux, as well as on
many other UNIX systems. This task is performed by a small piece of code called
"injector".

When you have to write some code to the process's address space you have to face
some problems which, if not treated, can cause your backdoor and also the
infected program crash after detaching. The injector code must deal with it and
ensure the injected code is executed after the process is restarted.

*) blocking syscalls:

It is quite common to modify the EIP register to point to injected code so after
detaching it from target process it can be run, this way of doing the injection
may generates problems when the previously instruction (which ptrace interrupted
) corresponds to a blocking syscall like read(),write(),etc. So if EIP is
changed, the kernel will continues the execution at this point skipping over the
syscall.

One way to solve this is to inject two pieces of code: the first one is placed
at EIP (starter) and the second one is placed into the stack (main code). Due to
the fact that the EIP register is not changed, kernel continues the execution of
the blocking syscall and when it finished the starter cames into play. The only
thing the starter must do is move the second code to a memory mapped area and
run it.

*) VDSO and vsyscall:

If you take a look to the objects loaded into the address space of any process
of your Linux system, you can see a segment called "[vdso]", it is the
"dynamically linked shared object". This object is loaded by the kernel and
contains three functions: __kernel_vsyscall(), __kernel_sigreturn() and
__kernel_rt_sigreturn(). The most important one for us is the vsyscall().
This function has the code to enter into kernel mode and there are two different
versions: int version and sysenter version. for more information about VDSO
check [6].

The problem here is that the latest kernels does not allow us to modify the code
of the VDSO segment, so we can not write the starter code into the vsyscall.
Once again there is a way to solve this new problem and it consist in searching
for the return address to the caller function:

                  ( wrapper code )
                 mov    %ebx,%edx
                 mov    0x8(%esp),%ecx
                 mov    0x4(%esp),%ebx
 ( vsyscall )    mov    $0x27,%eax       ( vsyscall )
 int 0x80 <----  call   *%gs:0x10  ----> push   %ecx
 ret      ,----> [ the starter code ]    push   %edx
  |       |      [  is placed here  ]    push   %ebp
  '-->----|                              mov    %esp,%ebp
          |                              sysenter
          |                              nop x7
          |                              jmp    0xffffe403
          |                              pop    %ebp
          |                              pop    %edx
          |                              pop    %ecx
          '----<----------------------   ret

*) VDSO analyzer:

The VDSO analyzer is just a set of small functions coded to help the code
provided to perform a runtime identification of that segment and get information
about their symbols:

 VDSOHandle *VDSOLoad(DWORD pid, DWORD base)
 VOID VDSOUnload(VDSOHandle *)
 VDSOSym *VDSOGetSym(VDSOHandle *, DWORD SymId)
 DWORD VDSOGetRet(VDSOHandle *, DWORD EIP, DWORD ESP)

4.2. Symbol resolution

Once the code has been injected the next step is to locate the syscall wrappers
to be hijacked. As was described in section 2, they are all part of the libc
shared object, so at this point some kind of built-in symbol resolver is
required.

*) shared object symbol resolver:

The symbol resolution is the most tedious process but the most funny as well.
Although exists some heuristics tricks to get the address of a shared object
symbol, only one is both reliable and faster: elf hash table. The description
of this generic mechanism is beyond the scope of this text, for more details
check out [3]. The code provided contains a function to deal with this task:
the shared object symbol resolver.

 VOID sosr(sosr *)

 sosr_flags              equ 00h ; DWORD     : options
 sosr_hash_table         equ 04h ; PVOID     : symbol hash table
 sosr_va_table           equ 08h ; PVOID     ; symbol address table
 sosr_sym_count          equ 0Ch ; DWORD     : num of symbols to be resolved
 sosr_base               equ 10h ; DWORD     : shared object base address
 sosr_dynamic            equ 14h ; DWORD     : dynamic section address
 sosr_map_names          equ 18h ; PVOID     : map name list (gsoinf_by_maps)
 sosr_lkm_names          equ 1Ch ; PVOID     : lkm name list (gsoinf_by_lkm)

The first thing the resolver does is to locate the base address of the shared
object, just only two methods to achieve this can be seriously considered: ld's
link_map structure and/or process maps file. The sosr() function take advantage
of both methods. The famous link_map list is a double linked list in which each
node describes a shared object that was loaded into the process address space.
The base address for each object is placed into this structure by the runtime
loader.

*) mapfile reader:

The Linux kernel maintains a maps file per process, commonly placed at /proc/PID
/maps, which describes all the memory mapped areas within the process. The
mapfile reader (mpfr) has been developed to cover this area, providing functions
to access the content of this file:

 DWORD mpfr_open(mpfr *)
 VOID mpfr_close(mpfr *)
 mapent *mpfr_search_by_vaddr(mpfr *mpfr, DWORD vaddr)
 mapent *mpfr_search_by_name(mpfr *mpfr, LPCSTR *name, DWORD size)
 mapent *mpfr_search_by_names(mpfr *mpfr, PVOID *names)
 mapent *mpfr_get_vdso(mpfr *mpfr)
 mapent *mpfr_get_stack(mpfr *mpfr)

The mpfr_open() routine opens the process' mapfile and build a linked list of
map entries, so you can go through this list in order to get the segment you are
searching for (the mpfr_search* and mpfr_get* routines).

The following is the content of a map entry:

 mapent_start            equ 00h ; DWORD     : beginning of segment
 mapent_end              equ 04h ; DWORD     : ending of segment
 mapent_size             equ 08h ; DWORD     : segment size
 mapent_flags            equ 0Ch ; DWORD     : segment type and options
 mapent_name             equ 10h ; LPSTR     : segment name (shared objects only)
 mapent_namesz           equ 14h ; DWORD     : segment name size
 mapent_next             equ 18h ; PMAPENT   : next entry

If you take a look to the code you will note that the mapfile reader is largely
used throughout the code, this is because it should never fail and uses a system
resource that is supposed to be always present. In fact, is the most stable
method I have found so far.

*) the magic table:

The magic table is just a big data structure which contains information about
the syscall wrappers. Each symbol has its own entry and it is 5byte long and has
the following format:

 0-1b      =   magic code
 1-5b      =   magic value

The first byte is the magic code and the value stored in it is the system call
number for the syscall wrapper referenced.

The following 4 bytes is the magic value, which is just a dword that take the
following values:

 1) a symbol name hash value
 2) a Elf32_Sym struct pointer
 3) a symbol code pointer
 4) a syscall sub-handler pointer

Essentially, when the code start, the magic value is the symbol name hash, then
, when sosr() is executed, this value is changed by a pointer to the
corresponding Elf32_Sym structure within the .dynsym section. And finally, just
a bit before the infected process is restarted, its content is changed again to
hold a pointer to a syscall handler code.

4.3 Setting Up Hooks

When the resolution process has finished and we know exactly where are placed
the wrappers, is time to insert the hooks.

*) system service invocation instruction:

As was described in section 2, a syscall wrapper is just a simple routine used
by application programmers to request a system service. This request is performe
d by executing a SSII (system service invocation instruction), so if we can
control when these instructions are executed (being replaced by a hook code) it
is possible to build a sort of pre-request and post-request layer in which each
syscall is handled by an associated handler code.

The most famous SSII is the "int 80" instruction that has been used in linux
since the earlier versions. Most recently releases of Linux kernel has
introduced support to the new sysenter/sysexit instruction which allows faster 
user to kernel transitions. The VDSO segment has been introduced to facilitate
the work of the libc, it has not to be worried about which SSII is used in the 
system, each wrapper have just only call the vsyscall() function. 
The code provided has support for all of this.

*) runtime code disassembling:

To proceed with the location of SSII's the whole symbol code must be
disassembled on runtime, so a good lde is required.  The best length
disassembler engine you can find for free (saving you to code your own) is
ADE,the Z0mbie's LDE. With this lde you can disassemble fast and is ok for our
purpose. I've changed some bytes of the code to support int80 instructions.

Initialize the table is as easy as follows:

                push    dword[ebp+ade_flagtable-gdelta]
                call    ade_init                        ; initialize tables for ade
                pop     eax

the same for disassembling:
                                                        ; ade_disasm params:
                push    dword[ebp+ade_flagtable-gdelta] ; p3: flagtable address
                push    dword[ebp+ade_dstruct-gdelta]   ; p2: disasm struct address
                push    esi                             ; p1: code address
                call    ade_disasm

*) symbol hot-patching:

When a SSII is found within the wrapper's body, it needs to be completely
replaced without modifying any previous and following instruction. The
searching process is done with help of ADE and the patching is performed with
the following chunk of code:

.patch          movzx   ecx,byte[ebx+ssii_contentsz]
                sub     esi,ecx
                mov     cl,byte[ebx+ssii_size]
                xchg    edi,esi
.write_trap:    push    byte _trap
                pop     eax
                stosb
                push    byte _nop
                pop     eax
                dec     ecx
.write_nop:     stosb
                loop    .write_nop

As you can see, first instruction's byte is changed by a int3, filling the rest
with nops. The following code snipped is an example of patched chroot() wrapper:

           pre-patch               post-patch
           ---------               ----------
0xb7ecf000 mov  %ebx,%edx       :  mov    %ebx,%edx
0xb7ecf002 mov  0x4(%esp),%ebx  :  mov    0x4(%esp),%ebx
0xb7ecf006 mov  $0x3d,%eax      :  mov    $0x3d,%eax
0xb7ecf00b int  $0x80           :  int3
                                :  nop
0xb7ecf00d mov  %edx,%ebx       :  mov    %edx,%ebx

           pre-patch               post-patch
           ---------               ----------
0xb7ecf000 mov  %ebx,%edx       :  mov    %ebx,%edx
0xb7ecf002 mov  0x4(%esp),%ebx  :  mov    0x4(%esp),%ebx
0xb7ecf006 mov  $0x3d,%eax      :  mov    $0x3d,%eax
0xb7ecf00b call *%gs:0x10       :  int3
                                :  nop x6
0xb7ecf012 mov  %edx,%ebx       :  mov    %edx,%ebx

4.4. Syscall Dispatching

This is the last step and the most important one, at this point the hooks has
been inserted, so we must prepare the "Trapped Syscall Dispatcher" (TSD).
The TSD is the default sigtrap signal handler, so it will handle any sigtrap
(syscall request) generated by the hooks. The setup_tsd() function is
responsible for installing, configuring and testing the TSD.

*) registering the TSD:

The TSD must be registered as the default SIGTRAP handler for the running
process. To do that we use the sigaction interface as follows:

set_traphndl:   xchg    ecx,edx
                lea     eax, [ebp+tsd-gdelta]
                push    eax
                push    byte sc_sigaction
                pop     eax
                int     80h
                add     esp,(4*_push)
                call    [ebp+cer2-gdelta]

Under some circumstances, an infected application could replace our TSD code by
an internal sigtrap handler. In order to avoid this problem the sigaction
interface should be hooked as well to not allow this operation.

*) registering the TSD sub-handlers

The TSD sub-handlers are just a set of functions associated to the system calls,
the most basic sub-handler is as follows:

_schndl_fork:   ; fork syscall handler:
.link:          mov     ebx,sc_fork
                cmp     eax,ebx
                jne     _schndl_read
                call    edx
.body:          call    def_schndl
                ret

All the TSD sub-handlers provided in the code are empty, except one (a basic
example). These functions are the place where you can put your favourite evil
code, each time the syscall is executed all of its parameters are available to
be inspected or whatever you want to do.

The registration of the TSD sub-handlers is performed by the following chunk of
code:

.install_sch:   ; install syscall handlers
                mov     ecx,[ebp+(magic_table+magic_entnum)-gdelta]
                lea     esi,[ebp+(magic_table+magic_entry)-gdelta]
                mov     edi,esi
.next:          xor     eax,eax
                lodsb
                stosb
                call    schndl_lookup
                stosd
                lodsd
                loop    .next

*) configuring the TSD

The TSD behaviour is configured by enabling (default) or disabling the HEP, It
means "handler execution prevention" and when it is enabled the TSD only handle
those syscall requests within the libc text segment.

*) testing the TSD

Test if the TSD works if quite simple, just generate a SIGTRAP by executing an
int3 instruction and perform some sanity checks when the TSD is executed and
when it has restored the context. The following chunk of code performs the test:

                xor     ecx,ecx
                mov     dword[ebp+hep-gdelta],ecx
                mov     eax,ecx
                inc     ecx
                mov     ebx,ecx
                inc     ecx
                mov     edx,ecx
                inc     edx
                mov     dword[ebp+pid-gdelta],eax
                int3    ; ---< internal trap >----------:
                push    byte sc_getpid
                pop     eax
                int     80h
                mov     esi,eax
                cmp     eax,dword[ebp+pid-gdelta]
                je      .enable_HEP
                call    [ebp+sdr-gdelta]


7. Limitations

The code provided is just a proof of concept demonstration, so it has some
limitations and restrictions. In first place, only intercepts syscalls executed
from wrappers functions and any request made from a different place within the
process's virtual address space may result in a bypass of the TSD, system calls
are out of our control and are passed directly to kernel. In second place, the
code is not "thread-safe", it means that the TSD has no support to handle
multiple threads, so the behaviour of a multithreading process once it has been
infected is totally unpredictable. For instance, if the thread we have infected
has not set CLONE_SIGHAND flag when it was created by a call to clone() it will
not share the table of signal handlers and, as a result, only that thread will
be able to handle our hooks whereas the rest surely will crash. Finally, the
code assume that the user has process trace capabilities and is allowed to use
ptrace() interface.


6. Conclusion

Write backdoors or viruses for Linux is always difficult, the code must run on 
different kernel versions, and not only the kernel but also other critical 
components like libraries can be updated, turning each target system different 
each other. The technique showed in this paper allows taking advantage of some 
system calls and how to use them to carry out actions that they weren't designed 
for. There are some other interesting components to be researched in order to 
improve our "black code".
