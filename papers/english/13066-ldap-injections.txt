The technique of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a lightweight
protocol to access the directory service X.500. This protocol works over TCP/IP.
The access protocol LDAP is used to query and modify objects stored.


---[ 0x02: Filters LDAP ]

   
It is quite important to understand how does the LDAP filters work.
FC 4515 (6/2006) (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515).

Filter = ( filtercomp )
Filtercomp = and / or / not / item
And = & filterlist
Or = | filterlist
Not = ! filter
Filterlist = 1*filter
Item = simple / present / substring
Simple = attr filtertype assertionvalue
Filtertype = "=" /"~="/ ">=" / "<="
Present = attr = *
Substring = attr "=" [initial] * [final]
Initial = assertionvalue
Final = assertionvalue

   
Logical operators:
- AND "&"
- OR "|"
- NOT "!"

Relational operators:
<=, >=, =, ~=

The wildcard "*" It is used to replace characters.
   
Filter example:
(&(objectClass=user)(uid=*)): We return a list of all objects of type user, no matter
which takes the value of the attribute "uid."

The technique Ldap injection is very similar to SQL injection.
The attack technique is used to operate websites built LDAP judgments directly from
data supplied by the user.

In line 10 note userName variable is initialized with the value
the parameter user and then quickly validated to see if the value is zero.
If the value is not zero, the variable userName is used to initialize the
variable filter on line 18.
This new variable is used directly to build an LDAP search to be used in
the call to SearchFilter on line 27
The attacker has full control over what will be consulted on the LDAP server.
You will get the result of the consultation when the code reaches of the line 32 to 40,
all results and its attributes are displayed to the user.

Example 1:
http://website/ldap.asp?user=*

In this example dispatched the character "*" parameter in the "user" which ends
in the variable filter.
This judgment LDAP will show any object that has an attribute uid.
We show all users and their information.

Example 2:
http://website/ldap.asp?user=ka0x)(|(homedirectory=*)

It will show us the path to the user ka0x.
They can do tests with the code before they leave.
