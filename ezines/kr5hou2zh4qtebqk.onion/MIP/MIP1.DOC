		     Local Area Networks
			    (LAN)
			      by
			 Ansi-Christ


     A local area network connects devices that are within a
short range. Most LANs are unable to connect to public
communications services. LANs were developed because most
communications within a business either occur in the very
same building or within a short distance of each other.
This allows for the sharing of information and equipment and
thus a large savings for the company.
     This files is the first in a series of files. It is not
meant to be a complete systems manual for all LANs, but a basic
reference manual on the terminology and general set up. In later
files there will be more specific information.
     This file can be distributed freely as long as none of the
information is changed. If I have made a mistake, please remember
that we are all human and this does happen. Contact me on one of
the two boards listed at the end to point out an error.


Topologies:

Ring -

     A ring type set up goes in one direction around a group
of devices until it reaches the device that is meant as the
destination. The ring will be connected by a cable to form
the ring. The ring topology uses a method known as token
passing. A token is like a bucket in which information can be
dumped. If a certain device does not contain this "bucket"
then it can not send out the data until it gets it. This will
prevent data collision from occurring.
     A LAN will usually transmit data in packets (buckets =
packets) and add the necessary routing information to the
packet. (this tells the packet where it's destination is)
Because a ring system has a circular shape the information is
routed in one direction and it will still reach its
destination.
     One note - I have altered the description of a token
slightly to avoid confusion. A token is usually sent before a
packet and will tell the next device if the following packet
is full or is capable of receiving data.

       O-----O----O



Tree -

     The tree set up links components to the network via
connectors. The network can be tapped at any available
point. Data can pass from one device to another and does not
have to route through a centralized point. Just the way a
tree network is set up should make it much faster than a ring
type network with the same computers and devices connected to
it. This type of network is also very useful because you
could add any additional devices as they were need via a
connector without having to go through major modifications to
the network itself.
     A tree network does occasionally, just because of the
nature of it's set up, have certain problems with controlling
the passing of data. There is a safety factor involved with a
tree network though. If one of the systems along the network
go down it will not adversely affect the network as a whole,
just that certain part.

Star -

     The star network is connected through a central
processing device. This device usually takes the form of a
PBX or a host computer system. All lines in this network are
connected to this central unit. When information must go to
another node on this network it must first pass through the
center. The star topology is very common and is probably the
most common set up for a network.
     There is a problem with the star though. If the central
unit goes down then the whole network is useless.

Transmission media -

Twisted pair wire is commonly used to connect all kinds of
equipment.  This is used in older buildings where it may be
very expensive to convert to newer types of cable.  Problems
with this include distortion of signals especially at higher
transmission speeds.

Coaxial cable consists of a single conductor surrounded by a
flexible metallic shielding to minimize signal loss and
interference.  Coaxial permits a high transmission speed.

Twin - Axial cable uses two Coaxial cables, one receiving and
one transmitting.  These cables are better than twisted pair
cable because of the higher transmission speed and longer
distance.


Baseband and Broadband Systems -

     A baseband LAN assigns its entire capacity to a single
user for a brief time. Only one device can use its pathway.
These networks usually use 3/8 inch coaxial cable.
Advantages are low cost, easy installation, and considerable
capacity.  Baseband does, though, not lend itself to voice
quality communication.

     A broadband LAN is sophisticated and uses common
television cable and a modem.  Although it is expensive it
will allow the network to handle voice, video,
teleconferencing, and graphics transmission.  It does
this by using different bandwidths so one signal does not
interfere with another signal. It is good for
high volume office communication.

     Fiber Optics are the next step although very expensive
it will eventually replace the other cables.  Fiber Optics
use light to transmit large amounts of information in a very
short time.  A single cable can carry 240 thousand calls at
once.


Interconnecting LANs -

     Bridges are one way of connecting similar networks.

     Gateways are a way of connecting dissimilar networks.
It acts as a translator between these networks.  It
understands different file structures, data types, and access
methods.


Vendors -

Ungermann-Bass is a large independent vendor. Offering both
base and broadband services and coaxial cable and fiber optic
LANs.

Systek is the OEM supplier of IBM's broadband network.

3Com is a major supplier of PC LANs.

Corvus sells Omninet. They offer a system based on twisted
pair wiring.

Interlan Inc. provides Ethernet based products.

Wangnet by Wang laboratories.

Codex 4000 series by Codex corp.

Information systems network by none other than AT&T
information systems. (commonly abbreviated ISN)

Novell network


LAN terms and what they mean - (note - originally printed in LAN
magazine)

Access method: a way to determine which workstation or PC
will be next to use the LAN. A set of rules by network
hardware and software that direct the traffic over the
network. Examples include Token passing and Carrier Sense
Multiple Access for Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

Collision: The result of two workstations trying to use a
shared transmission medium (cable) at the same time. The
electronic signals collide and ruin both signals. The whole
process takes seconds.

Collision detection: The process of detecting when a
collision has occurred. Workstations know a collision has
occurred if the other station sends no reply that the signal
was received.

Disk Server: a device equipped with disks and a program that
allows users to make and store files on the disks. Allows
each user to have an increase in storage space normally not
accessible at their PC.

Drop cable: The cable which allows connection and access to
the trunk cables of a network.

Locking: prevents people from changing the same data at the
same time.

Polling: used in star networks. allows the central "hub"
system to know when a node wants to transmit.

On Payphones - By The Surge

     A payphone is a payphone is a payphone, I think that Shakespeare said that
once.  At anyrate, the payphone I will be dealing mostly with, due to my
familiarity with this model, is the Western Electriric Rotary fone.This should
hold true to most models of payphones as I will not go into vivid detail on
the aspects of this model alone.  This is basically my notes on the findings
that I have come up with upon opening payphones that I deem noteworthy to
myself and others who have not opened payphones or have not studied payphones
that they have opened in depth.
Opening the phone.
     One of the most important concepts to realize when opening a payphone is
that a payphone is basically a wall-mounted safe containing a phone (with dtmf
pad/rotary dial exposed) and a cashbox (and related mechanisms).  When opening
a safe, you must realize that the easiest way to open a safe is through the
opening method provided.  In the case of the payphone, this consists of a lock
and a turn-key insert.	This lock is in the middle of the right hand side of
the phone.  This contains many tumblers similar to a safe and can be
manipulated by drilling a hole around the key insert with a hole-saw drill.
The turn-key is on the left side at the same level as the cradle for the hand-
set.  Drill a similar hole around this mechanism also.	In removing the
tumblers of the right side, you will expose the slide that should be pressed
downward by a screwdriver or similar probing type tool.  Then the same should
be done to the turn-key side.  Use of a mallet may assist the pushing of the
probe to get the slide into the down position.	At this time the top-front of
the phone should be lifted upward and outward and the insides will be exposed.
The black metal is only a shell that covers the inner metal and removal of this
metal will accomplish nothing.
     Payphones were meant to withstand the attact of a vandal who does not have
power tools.  No matter what gamma rays may turn you into the Incredible Hulk,
you will not be able to open the phone without power tools.  To elaborate on
how strong the metal is, in opening a dented phone, I broke 1 hole-saw drill
bit, 2 screwdrivers and a mallet.  All physical manhandling will do to a phone
is to bind the lock and wreck the electrical devices inside.  Once the lock is
bound, it is next to impossible to open the phone without a blow-torch.  Also,
if you know a locksmith well enough and the lock is still in working condition
you may be able to have a key made up for it (with the right connections, this
is not impossible as I have found out).
Tone Oscilator-
     AKA the redbox holds, on the Western Electric models at least, a 2 way
switch which you may find interesting.	It is labled  CF   DTF	for Coin First
and Dial-tone First as you may have read in BIOC 003's course VI on payphones.
It is very interesting and annoying to realize that it is a switch you will
find every time that you walk up to a phone that is set to CF.	"Jeeze, all I
have to do is throw one stupid leetle (Mexican for little) switch and I could
use a Blue Box, code, 3rd party billing, collect-call, 800-diverter ect....
The tone oscilator is connected to a central unit via 11 pin connector.
Dialing Unit-
     The dialing unit is also connected into the central unit via an 11 pin
connector.  The dialing unit holds the dtmf pad/rotary dialing wheel and the
cradle and the cord to the hand-set.  The cord to the hand-set is protected
with an armoured outside shell and a very strong cable inside which the red,
yellow, black and green wires braid themselves around.
Coin Mechanism-
     The coin mechanism starts in the upper left hand side of the phone and
goes back to the back of the phone, through the totalizer (red-box mechanism)
and and back out to the bottom-front of the phone.  It will hold a maximum of
17 quarters before the load has to be dropped into the cashbox (that is why you
should never try to red-box more than $4.25 into a phone at any one interval.)
At that point as one noted friend of mine found out (Dr. Killdeath) something
like this will happen:
"Hello?"
"Hello sir, this is the operator.  Just what exactly are you trying to pull
here?"
"Your leg baby!"
-click!
Conclusion-
     Maybe I will find out even more with my next payphone and as allways, I
will be willing to share my findings with all that are willing to take interest
and read.  Dr. Killdeath, if you read this, contact me at one of the boards
I have mentioned bellow as I haven't heard from you since Red Square.  Any
comments (especially additions) please contact me at any of the boards I call.

On pedestals - By The Surge & Bellcon

     First off, by far, phreaking entails much much more than codes.  The
true phreak is into the "hands-on" aspect of phreaking more than the
bluebox programs or the codes.	This experience is using actual blueboxes,
trashing and the now ever so popular and still growing field of 'pedestal
 hacking.'  Pedestals are the 'cans', or grey-green boxes that are owned by Bell
on the side of the road.  These appear only in rural or suburban areas.  In
cities, you must use the same methods but these ports may be found in
manholes instead.  Basically, a pedestal is an interface, are bridging
gap, between two stretches of telephone cables.  The first stretch being from
your Central Office to your street, and the second from there to your house.
In every-day use, it is mainly used as an access port for line testing and
installation by lineman.  They are no longer needed in the use of manual
eavesdropping by Bell since all modern eavesdropping is done in your Central
Office, and will be undetected because there is no voltage drop.  This is not
to say that you cannot eavesdrop from these points though.  Radio Schlock
sells a $20.00 recorder that will only record when there is a drop in voltage
on the line (someone picks up a phone) which can be attached at the terminal
set of the person you wish to eavesdrop on.  Other than this device, Radio
Schlock also sells the new CPA-1000 pen register.  This will keep acurate tabs
on any phoneline you wish to keep these records on and runs about $100.00. (See
May '87 of 2600 Magazine.)  Keep in mind that to hook these devices up to
someones phone lines is not only
an invasion of privacy but is also in
many ways against the law.  If you are in the pedestal to begin with you
obviously have no reguard for either so I guess it is no big deal.  Of course
you all have the files on how to build "beige" boxes aka linesman's handsets
so I won't bother with that.  This is of course an effective tool to monitor
conversations.	I personally use an actual test set which has the built in
monitor on it so it goes virtually un-noticed.	If you wish to modify your
own phone to do the same, just disconnect the grey (or blue or white)
wire on the F1-Post and the same effect will be accomplished in a cruder way.
The big drawback is that you will wind up bringing the entire base of the
phone along with you to have this feature.
     Next order of business is some annoying things that you can do to
someone from the pedestal.  Basically, when you are at the pedestal you have
much more power than at any of their phones.  If they detect you on the line
and go to call the "proper" authorities, just disconnect the wires
from the terminal blocks and they can not complete the call because their
phone will be dead.  Then run like hell.  Elsewhere in this issue of MIP
are the plans for the 'ring-busy' device.  This may also be hooked to the
terminal blocks easily. I do recommend printing out that file or at least
saving it to disk as it could come in very handy.  It makes the line ring
once, then give busy status.  The owner of the line can make outgoing calls but
will not even hear the first ring.  One thing to remember when using the
monitor/disconnect or the ring-busy device is that if the owner of the line
has 2 lines, be sure to disconnect/busy both of them.
     Experimentation is something that is the best about pedestal hacking.
It is pretty much wide open. [No pun intended.]  One interesting thing that
you can do is to run wires from one set of terminal blocks to the other.  Both
lines will be connected to each other and this provides quite a humourous
effect to listen in on a test set with.  Another good way of phucking around is
to take the wires running from one set of terminal blocks and change them with
wires from another set of terminal blocks.  This will cause all line A's
calls to go to house B and vice-versa.	Another interesting device to hook up
(neither of us have tried this but in theory it could work) is to take a
battery that will produce a large (but not too large) amount of voltage (like
a car battery) and hook this up to an alternater which will cause the voltage
to run in pulses.  This will cause the line to constantly ring [or at least
make the bell ringer lock up] until the phone is picked up.  When the phone is
put back down, this will continue.   This will disallow outgoing and
incoming calls and be a general annoyance.
     Opening the pedestal can be acheived simply.  If it is the type of
a case that has 2 doors on the front and opens like a closet (quiet front or
QF) just insert a 7/16" socket wrench (key word-socket since there are
washers around the nut that make it impossible to use anything but a socket
wrench or nut-driver) and just follow the directions printed above the
handle.  For the 'can' type boxes, just undo the nuts with a 7/16" socket
wrench (again, only socket) and lift the front cover off by pulling on the
'handle' at the bottom and pulling down and off. (This also makes a great seat
on those wet nights!).
     Now all you have to do is find out what line you are accessing (be sure
it's not yours!) by using ANI.  If you are not from the 518 area I would
suggest subscribing to 2600 and writing in for your ANI (if you don't allready
know it) If you are from 518, 998 (or in some weird places 997) is what you
want to dial to find the number of the line that you are on.  Once you are
sure that it is not yours, you can call anywhere for free since you are using
the phone of someone else.
     One thing that I have noticed in looking around at a lot of pedestals is
what we call a 'node'.  It is protected by a black rubber cap.  The nodes are
easy to see, as they are usally two or	three feet up the pole, and have black
wires running either from the ground, or the top of the pole.	The caps can
be very easily removed to expose a set of terminal posts.  Since these nodes
are mounted on the telephone pole they provide easy access to the lines since
you don't have to open a pedestal at all to get at them.  They are, other
than the access-ability factor, the same as the terminal blocks inside of a
pedestal.
     One thing that should be mentioned is a reminder.	If you happen to cut
any of the wires inside, intentionally or not, you have committed a serious
crime.	Not only is this theft and vandalism, it may be deemed by
officials as something more organized.	Many things are carried over phone
lines besides just voices.  Lines such as bank or lottery data, medical
systems, and alarm systems are a few of the things that when cut, could lead to
some serious trouble.  In one such case similar to this, the local division of
the FBI showed up for some thorough investigating (along with TelCo and
State Police.)
     Well, that is just about all that I have to say 'on pedestals'.
     One final note, a pedestal is not yet in use, there is still current
running through it although you will not get a dialtone from any of the
terminals or wires themselves.	They are basically useless although the
cases make great end tables for your room.  Look in the future for a follow
up file dealing with test probes and other lineman paraphenalia as well as
with anything else that we learn from Ma Bell (knock on wood).

!		   Getting The Most For Your Money -- Hotels		      !
!		       Written for M.I. Magazine -- 5-4-87		      !
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


     Have you ever been on vacation and while staying in a hotel you realized
that they are ripping you off?	If so, read on.  I will list some various ways
to save money and possibly have a good time screwing them over.

     While staying in a hotel room you may realize that it is not very easy
to phreak from the room due to the fact that they monitor every outgoing call.
If there is no charge for outgoing calls, feel 'free' to phreak as you
normally would from home.  If there is a charge, you may be able to phreak
using alternative methods.  On your hotel phone it may say 'dial 8+1+(area
code) + number.'  This is of course is just designating that you want an
outside line, and to record billing for hotel records purposes.  Try dialing
other numbers first other than an 8 first.  If you get a dial tone then use
that line to dial out.	You may still get billed for it, but then again, you
may not.  It sure as hell can't hurt.  For some reason hotels are now all
going to modular jacks...this is a direct invitation to take what (what
could be easier?)  When most maids are done cleaning they will leave the doors
to rooms open.	Walk right in and take a phone from that room.	I would not
advise that you take your own phone (for obvious reasons.)
     There is of course the tried and true method of walking over to a hotel
pay phone to carry out your business.  This also brings up an interesting
point.	Most hotel phones are indoors on hotel walls.  The strongest support
they have to the wall is some plaster and a few wood screws.  It would be a
bit risky to take one from this location, but it's always an option.
     Upon looking around many hotels, you may notice that the power switches
for ENTIRE hallways are left in the open, unlocked.  This could bring about
a quite chaotic situation, making it quite easy for you to enter someone's
room and take what you please.	Be weary of the emergency power lights
that are ALWAYS in hotels.  I would not suggest you do this, it is only proving
that hotel management is not always the smartest class of people in the world.
     If the hotel is of any good quality, it will have a restaurant
somewhere on the premisis.  Walk in and eat until you burst, upon paying your
bill politely ask if you can bill it to your hotel room.  Be sure to ask if
these arrangements can be made before-hand.  All they will want is a
name and room number.  Make any room and name up as they will not usually
verify it.  (What hotel would want to harrass and 'honest' customer?)
     Finally, when checking in and out, keep your eyes on the computer.  As
stated earlier, hotel management is not too smart.  Not smart enough to
remember logon procedures and passwords that is.  It is not unlikely that the
whole procedure will be written stamped on the terminal.  Keep this for future
reference!

If you are not impressed with this file, stop complaining.  Request
something next issue, or take whatever you get.  You're not PAYING for this!

that are listed above.	If you know telenet, you know that this makes Merit
practically unlimited.	I hear from Bellcon that there is a UNIX out there
with the uucp account and password uucp but it needs a core dump to get to
the prompt.  If you are into that sort of thing, go for it!  If not, there are
still quite a few other destinations that you may wish to hack.  I am sure that
that UNIX is wide open seeing that uucp's pw was uucp.  Try the other default
accounts.  Merit is down at this time due to extensive hacking and a friend of
mine got a little note on his MTS account about this so be carefull not to do
this from MTS or anywhere where it can be tied to you.	To get to MERIT just
type:
%call 999900009999
when you are connected to the 266-8989 dialup or any dialup of ISNET.  I hear
that the 266 prefix will be soon changed to 276 but the last 4 digits of ISNET
will remain the same 8989.  I hope you enjoyed this file.  It took no great
intelligence to write but can be used as a reference for serious hackers who
have not tried MERIT yet.  This is a way for you to get started and I wish you
the best of luck on getting accounts in all your travels and hope you never
choose to destroy any data or system anywhere.	Remember, the greatest sence of
power comes from holding the power to destroy a system, and choosing not to..

Introduction
------------
 Well this is the How To file on The Ring-Busy Device. This is very simple
to construct and is also very simple to connect on someones fone line. It is
probably the easiest thing you will ever do what is actually worth what
little effort you put in. Now your probably saying to yourslef:


What The Hell Is A Ring-Busy Device?
------------------------------------
 A Ring-Busy Device is ofcourse a
device that when connected on to you enemys fone line will make it so that
when you call this persons fone you will get a Ring-Busy. A ring-busy is
exactly what it says, A ring and then a busy, That is One ring and from then
on busy. Also the pathetic person who has the fone that this device is being
used on will not have his fone ring.  This means he will not even know that
anyone is calling. Your probably saying BIG DEAL, why not just cut his line!
Well this is better because he can still use his fone, thats right, if
he wanted to he could pick up his fone and he would get a dial tone, he could
then dial out not knowing of this device. This is especially useful for
those r0dent BBS's that are pissing you off. If someone has a BBS and this
device is on the line then they wont get any calls for their BBS (hehe), and
they wont know why either!


How the Ring-Busy Device Was Conceived
--------------------------------------
 It all started one morning at 4am when I went out special to steal this
emergency police/fire fone. Once I got
it home I hooked it up to my line and noticed that whenever someone called
me they would get a ring-busy, this was extremely odd, so I tried to figure out
why the hell that was happening, and I did, and now we have the Ring-Busy
device. It is also useful if dont want to talk to someone but you dont want to
put the fone off the hook, just put this little device on and those leeches
that keep bothering you for games wont be a problem anymore.


Ring-Busy Device Plans
----------------------
 As I said before this is very very simple to construct.

Parts Needed:
 (1) 7k resistor (7000 OHMS)
 (1) Fone line
 (1/2) a brain (at least)

Procedure:
 Now all you have to do is connect up this 7k resistor to the fone line on
the red and green terminals, Here is an easy diagram of how to add it onto
someones fone line. The diagram represents the nice little box that the
fone line comes through on the side of your house.
 NOTE: This is for a 1 fone line configuration. If they have two I think
you'd figure it out? If not too Bad...

Diagram:
	  #########
	  #	  #
	  # G-7-R #
	  #	  #
	  #########
					 G - Green terminal
 R - Red Terminal
 7 - 7k resistor

Now if they have 2 fone lines then connect another 7k resistor to the
black and yellow terminals.

 Its That Simple....
7k resistors might be a some-what hard to get, try your local electronics
store and dont bother with Rat Shack, I already checked, they dont sell them.
 If you must, a 6.5k or maybe 7.5k resistor will work, but Ma Bell uses
7k so I do the same.


Suggestions
-----------
 Here are a few ways to use or misuse this device.
 1) Connect it on to your fone:
Simple just cut off the modular end of your fone cord and connect it to the
red and green wires, then connect the modular plug you cut off to the
resistor too, and then just plug the fone in and you have a permanent
Ring-Busy Device, Another way of doing it would be to put a SPST switch in
there so you can turn it on or off, thats what I do and it works great
(Especially when r0dents start bothering me)
 2) Connect it to your favorite enemys fone line, and enjoy while watching
him try to figure out why he isn't  getting any fone calls, BUT if the
luser has 2 fone lines I suggest that you connect one Ring-Busy Device onto
each fone so he doesn't get calls on the other fone from people telling him
that his fone is phucked.


Conclusion
----------
 Well as this file comes to an end, I would like to tell you to call some
of the best boards around:

Introduction:
-------------
 In this file on Crahing a C-Net I will discuss methods of making, using, and
getting backdoors on C-Net, I will also show some C-Net programming and how to
make your very own backdoor!
  First I will discuss ways to get SysOp access on a cnet...There are a
few ways and most are effective.


Method 1
--------
 Now this method is quite simple BUT a certain access level is needed. This
works like this:
 First: you must try and convince the SysOp to give you SubOp access of one
of the UD sections, this is the only thing stopping you from complete
control of his board. If you dont have a commie then try to convince him to
have maybe a g-philes section or a UD section of your computer type and for
him to make you a subop, this won't be too hard if you are an expert in the
art of bullshitting.
 Second: (This is the easy part) Log on the board real late at night (somewhere
between 2-4am) and go into your sub in the UD section, then hit Z for subop
maintenance and once in there hit 2, once you are at this menu change the
name of the UD section to:
name/e (where the name is the name of the UD). Then leave the subop
maintenance and leave the UD section, then go back into the UD section and
you will see that your UD section is now a ENTIRE DISK EXCHANGE MODE which
means you can kill/upload/download anything on the disk.
 Third: Now you must make for yourself backdoor, and then upload it to the
board in place of the a prg. file already on the disk (making a backdoor
for yourself will be discussed later)
 Fourth: Now just execute the prg. file you replaced with your backdoor and
your set!!


Method 2
--------
   Now this method is simple and you dont need subop access BUT the sysop
of the BBS you want to install this backdoor on has to be either:
1) a Lazy bum
 or
2) a completely stupid asshole
   This is how it works...
 First: You must go into the p-files section and see if there are any games
in there, if not then funs over, this method wont work. Dont get your hopes
up just because there are online games, now what you have to do is execute each
one and make sure that each one is there and make sure you dont see:
'Error reading "name of game"', if you dont get any errors and all the games
are there then your out of luck.
 Sorry, but the reason why it would say error reading the game is because that
game isn't on the disk (or maybe it is just that the sysop misspelled the name
, in any case...If there is an error than you now have the ability to
install a backdoor.
 Second: This is easy from now on, now all you have to do is go into the UD
section and upload a game with the name prg.name of game missing.
Example: game missing is wrestling, so you upload a game called prg.wrestling.
 Get it? Well anyways this prg. that you upload must be you very own
backdoor (this will be discussed later)  Third: Just execute that game after
you have uploaded it and you in control


Method 3
--------
 This is probably the most worthless method and the hardest to do, but what
the hell. In this method you must:
 First: Get ahold of an online game that the sysop does not have and is
somewhat a good game, then install a backdoor (discussed later) and then
upload it to the UD section, if the sysop is an idiot he will add it to the
p-files section without even checking it, if he is smart he will check it
for backdoors and if he is a complete idiot or you are good at hiding back
doors than he'll add it to the p-files section.
 Second: Once it's in the p-files section just execute it and go with
your backdoor. That simple!


Method 4
--------
 Do the same as method 3 BUT do not install a backdoor in the game, and
wait till he puts it in the p-files section, once he does go into the UD
section you uploded it to and check if its still there, if so then since
you uploaded it, just kill it and then upload your backdoor, then execute
the game and Ta Da!


Making A Backdoor For Yourself
------------------------------
 NOTE: It always helps to have a commie at hand when editing or making games
or backdoors for CNET but I'm sure any computer will do.
 Here I will discuss some of the variables needed and some sub-routuines
need to make a backdoor or game.
  Well first of all to start out all CNET games MUST be between the lines of
512-580, and you can not skip lines.
---------------------
 Important Variables:
---------------------
a$ - used to print out things on the BBS, goes with a gosub 40, for example if you wanted to print out 'axeman is
an asshole' you could do that by doing:
a$="axeman is an asshole":gosub40
ac% - this is your access level, the access levels of cnet go from 0-9 (9
being sysop, and 0 being new user) I will discuss access levels in detail
in a later file.
 NOTE: one easy way to make a backdoor would be to but somewhere in the game
a line like this:
ac%=9, that would give you sysop access an$ - the response of an input, (in
other words what the luser typed in)
b$  - current board # your in.
cm$ - prompt (example=MAIN:)
id  - your id
d1$ - last call date
d2$ - current time and date
pw$ - your password
------------------------
 Important Sub-Routines:
------------------------
gosub 2100 - like input.(an$=the inputs response)
gosub 40   - to print something out to the modem,(Example: a$="hello":gosub40
will print out 'hello')
goto 6000  - logoff the user
goto 1300  - the main menu
goto 512   - execute a p-file(game)
goto 16000 - read a file
gosub61000 - do this 1st before going
to 512 for loading in a game example:
to load 'dumb game' do this:
a$="dumb game":goto61000:goto512
  Well those are some of the real neccesities.

NOTE: When printing something out to the modem a ctrl-k will act as a
carriage return. Example:
a$="<ctrl-k>hello<ctrl-k>":gosub40 that will print a return then hello and
then another return.

Backdoor Example:
-----------------
 Here is a very simple example of a backdoor file for cnet, if you want
you can use this, or your very own backdoor.
 Here goes:
512 a$=" a stupid backdoor ":gosub40
513 ac%=9:goto1300
 As you probably know the example i've given will print out' a stupid backdoor
' and will then give you sysop access, and then return you to the main menu.
 The above is ofcourse a lame example, I dont have time for a complicated one.
But I think you got the idea...If not then leave me mail on any board I'm on.
 Also try contacting your local commie user, he might be able to supply you
with some nice ones, If you need one real bad, let me know and I'll make
a few for you.


C-Net Trick
-----------
 This isn't much but it is a simple way to find out who posted a anonymous msg
on a CNET, this only works with the main message not the responses. What
you do is read the message and then privately reply to the idiot who posted
the message(Ooops I forgot to tell ya that you have to have a good idea of
who the hell posted it...) then once you have done that go into the e-mail
section by hitting M at the main menu and then type V to verify someones mail
then all you do is enter that persons name and if it says that guy has a
msg from you that you know it's him...
 Not so great a trick eh?

     So, you are walking through your local Caldor, you see a phone sitting
there, there are no clerks around, and nobody is watching you, it is now time
to use the phone.  Yes, you too can make calls to lots of different and strange
places in your Caldor!	In this first issue of Caldor Phone Numbers, I will
give you some neat numbers to mess around with.  To use these numbers, pick up
the phone, dial a 7, then wait for a louder dial tone, then you can put in the
number of your choice.	Here are the numbers you could use:
