                         Some Things You Can Do To
                       Piss Off The Local Authorities.
                       ( Neighbours, Teachers, Pigs. )
                   Compiled By Blewt and Cancerous Pr0strate

    Here I am again bringin' the best ways to have fun this side of Australia.
In my last edition I showed you: Some dry ice uses,
                                 The calcium carbide fireball,
                                          AND
                                 The psycho grenade launcher.

This release, as stated before you'll learn how to create and apply:
        Thermite
        Black Match Fuse (A little extra 4 ya'z)
        Pipe Bombs
    And also there are a few things on how to practically 'run' your school.

****UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE****
For all of you people who watched REAL LIFE last Monday (22nd) the Terrorists
Handbook has finally filtered into the hands of the Victorian police force.
Who said they werent a bunch of stupid slow bastards? It's only THREE YEARS OLD!
It took them this long to find it? Let's hear it for all the anarchists out
there!! Keep up the good work guyz! Thanx to Mt.Waverley High for their effort
against society.

The I.R.A. (Irish Republican Army) are to cease fire. My heroes! The most 
legendary anarchists of all time are surrendering! How could this have
happened? Lets pick up where they left off Australia, the A.R.A. perhaps? ;)

Hot off the phone lines. The CIB are pushing for a new bill to outlaw the
publication of material such as this article. Do they honestly think they
could stunt the growth of Australia's largest (and only) anarchy team?
NO FUCKING WAY MAN! MAIM FOR EVER!! LONG LIVE ALL MAIM'ERS!(DEATH TO PIGS!)
****UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE**UPDATE****

Thermite: Wanna be able to melt through the roof of an enemies locker roof? Or
~~~~~~~~~ maybe burn a hole right through the assholes car bonnet/roof/door or
petrol tank? Then THERMITE will be next on mum's shopping list for you. As you
may have already guessed, this is a VERY potent incendiary device. Thermite 
will literally melt the balls off a brass monkey (if you so desire). "What do
I need" I hear you excitedly ask, well here you go:

  Ingredient/Equipment.                  Where to get it.
  ---------------------                  ----------------

  Rust.(Lots'n'lots)                     Home brew. (shown below)
  Aluminium shavings.(A fair bit)        Hardware store or flogged from school.
  Sparkler (the silver type)		 Safeway


    Okay, that's everything. Not a lot? That's the best thing! Okay, first, 
to create rust you- can do it the shit way and scrape it off wherever it is,
or you can create (grow?) your own. Get a big iron bolt, some salt, water, jar
and a battery charger. Fill up the jar about 2/3 and dissolve some salt into 
it. Then attach the positive ("+"..duh!) electrode to the bolt and drop it in
the jar. Put the negative electrode in the water too. Let this rust away for a 
day or two (or when ever you see that there is a HEAP of red shit in the 
water). If there is heaps of red stuff in the water, filter it out (it's rust)
and replace the water with fresh stuff, and salt too. It's a good idea to set
up a few of these little dudes coz ya need a fair bit of rust. When your
freshly made rust has been dried, add 8 grams of it to every 3 grams of 
aluminium fillings. However a 50% to 50% mixture will also work. Place a small
pile of Thermite on whatever object you want to fuck-over then place the 
sparkler (or a magnesium ribbon) in the pile and light it...this stuff is said
to be able to vapourize carbon steel. One small pile on a persons car bonnet
will burn through the bonnet, the engine block and start burning into the
concrete beneath! Experiment!

Black Match Fuse: If you don't have enough money or can't be fucked buying 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ some fuse from a hobby shop, then here's a way to step
around it. The black match fuse is quick and easy to make. Get some COTTON
(make sure it's cotton by burning it, if a coal and smoke remain, it is)
thread and cut about ten 30cm lengths from it. Bundle them together by tying
both ends and twisting it around (my girlfriend platted them for me).
Get some black powder and moisten it with a select-a-spray until it's a bit 
mushy, then roll the bundled threads around in it. Make sure there's a fair
bit of the shit all in the threads. Keep about three or four cm's without mix
on them to tie to a coat hanger. Make about seven of these and hang'em in the
oven to drive out the moisture, the spring sun will not do a good enough job
of it. There you go, you should have some hard crusty fuses. Store in a dry
and safe place ready for use, I dunno how long they last like this so make 'em
when ya need em. Hang on to your new fuses and go to the next section...

Pipe Bombs: The mother of all home made explosives device. These are SO easy 
~~~~~~~~~~~ to make, even a cop can do it! The destructive force is really cool.
Also a perfect weapon against nature- trees in particular. (ok, ok, a little
far with the trees already!). Take a trip to your local hardware store, a good
one. Ask if you can get a piece of pipe cut to some specific measurements. If 
they do, buy a couple of 30cm lengths with thread and caps for EACH end. The
pipe should be about as thick as your wrist. Now with this, go back to your 
work shop. Mix up a nice large batch of black powder for your pipe. Cap one 
end of the pipe and drill a hole in the centre of it. The hole should be 
about.. umm, about 1/2 the width of a pen. I know that is a shit measurement 
to go by, but I don't know the size of the drill bit I use. Just make it small 
enough so the fuse fits good and the powder don't fall out. Cap one end of ya
pipe and stuff some tissue or other wadding in there. Fill the bottom of the
pipe with black powder an stick in the fuse, about six cm's inside is enough
and above 10 on the outside, depends on the fuse quality. Fill up the rest of
the pipe with black powder, and maybe some nails for fun. Before it's totally
full, chuck on a bit more tissue, but don't pack it down. The looser it is,
the better. Cap the other end and get creative. You know what I'd blow up 
(...tree...:) but perhaps you would rather a car, person, or even part of
your neighbours house. All are highly recommended. Also, if you want to save
your pipe, you can leave a cap off one end and you'll have a mini cannon! You
can figure that one out for ya selves.

How To Run Your School: Is it me or is there always that asshole teacher at
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ every school? Don't you wish that once, just once you
could do ANYTHING to your school? Well perhaps these little doozies (stupid 
word) can help. Here are a few hints on how to roll everyone and anyone at
your prison.....I mean school:
 
Things You'll Need :..
1) Fountain pen or Posca texta.
2) Super glue.
3) Two bux worth of 10›'s.
4) A couple o water bombs.
5) Liquid soap. (Morning Fresh with extra lemon scent.)
7) A two dollar coin.
8) A small set of tools with wire cutters, screwdrivers and shit.
9) Plenty of wire.
10) One of those microphones that transmits to the FM band
11) A small walkman that is set to receive the mic output in the above line.
    Also it must have it's own internal speakers.
12) A few zip lock bags.
13) A peeled orange.

    1) Fountain pens are wicked for desecration a clean surface. See how many
       different surfaces you can mar in one flick. Get creative, see what you
       get, tables, walls, ceilings, the guy sitting next to you, the teacher.
    2) Get the super glue and 10›'s. Find some places to glue them, like the
       cunteen (heh) window, a urinal, doors and shit. Watch and laugh at the
       scab's who try to pry them off.
    3) In your school toilets look in the urinals and you should see some 
       little yellow round things at the bottom for hiding the smell of urine,
       get a fuck load of towelling and pick these up and put them in the soap
       dish at the basins...now sit back and laugh your ass off at all the 
       people who mistake them as soap and try to wash their wands with them.
    4) Get a couple o' water bombs and fill 'em with gas in your chemistry 
       room. Go to where all the smokers hang out and drop a few. They'll
       get a big surprise when they decide to be cool and pop one with their
       smoke....heheheh, cool Mini fireball.
    5) This is a pearler on a wet day. If the floors at school are lino' or
       polished wood squirt a shit load of dish washing detergent on the floor
       an watch all the fools slide from wall to wall. If you have the very
       scented stuff then everyone will STINK! Heheheh.
    6) In chem or physics heat a two dollar coin until it's red hot. Drop it
       on the floor, or table of your enemy, wait for him to pick it up, and
       then when he does......HOLY SHIT!!! (heheh)
    7) If there is any better way to roll your school, I'd love to be told.
       This one involves the microphone, tools and wire. Get into an empty room
       and make sure it stays empty for about 20 minutes. You'll have to
       butcher the walkman, connect the speaker wires to the PA. system wires,
       turn on the radio and mic, then all you have to do is talk. I don't
       exactly know the correct wires an' shit coz my friends did this, but
       I do know that the PA. system has to be on, and the if you don't have
       the right walkman, you'll have to build a small amp. A guy at school
       said that the mini-amp is simple. After the shit is set up all you have
       to do is make your own announcements.  "Excuse this message but could all
       the teachers in the school ... GET FUCKED!!!....(giggle giggle giggle)"
 

    Oh well, that's about it from me, it's pretty late, Total Recall is over
and Star Trek (Chain of Command I) is about to start, so C yaz l8r.


            And remember, if it doesn't explode.....it's no FUN!
