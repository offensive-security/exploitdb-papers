- b4b0: open up to complete relief.

- Imagine. A crisp, refreshing, mountain waterfall in your kitchen.
That's the beauty of b4b0. It turns tap water into wonderful water. The
remarkable filter virtually eliminates lead and chlorine. Copper, water
hardness and sediment are dramatically reduced. There's nothing like the
greate taste of b4b0. And you never have to leave your home sweet home.

- b4b0 relieves your sneezing, and itchy, runny nose - even your stuffy
nose. b4b0 works for a full 24 hours. b4b0 won't put you to sleep or keep
you awake like some antihistamines and decongestants do. b4b0 is a
prescription drug for patients 12 years of age and over. Effectiveness of
b4b0 depends on reglar use, but it is not addictive. Symptons may begin to
improve within 12 hours. Maximum nasal symptom relief may take serveral
days. The most common side effects (nasal burning, nasal irritation,
nosebleeds, headache and sore throat) occured in fewer than 7 our of 100
people. Only your doctor or health care provider can determine the best
treatment option for you.

- b4b0 is well tolerated. It has a low occurence of side effects, which
occured about as often as they did with placebo (sugar pill). Most common
were headache, occuring with 12% of people; drowsiness, 8%; fatigue, 4%;
and dry mouth, 3%

Warning:  Women who are pregnant must not use or handle broken b4b0
          tablets for risk of a serious and specific birth defect. 54%
          readers of b4b0 maintained their current leetness, 46% regained
          some leetness.

WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES

SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: b4b0 Contains Carbon Monoxide.

        In clinical trials, b4b0 was well tolerated. Some men experienced
side effects, including headache, facial flushing, and upset stomach. A
small percentage of men experienced mild and temporary visual effects.

        Like all presecription products, b4b0 may cause side effects. A
very small number of men experienced certain side effects, such as: less
desire for sex, difficulty in acheiving an erection, and a decrease in the
amount of semen. Each of these side effects occured in less than 2% of
men. These Side effects were reversible and went away in men who stopped
taking b4b0. They also disappeared in most men (58%) who continued taking
b4b0.

SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: b4b0 Can Cause Heart Disease, Lung Cancer,
Emphysema, and May Complicate Pregnancy.

hi again. this is ge0rge, your editor, bringing you another compact issue
of b4b0(tm). With the great reviews of b4b0[i], we could do no less than
produce b4b0[ii], another, anally satisfying issue of b4b0! (which will
probably be followed by b4b0[iii], b4b0[iv], b4b0[v] and so on.) I do hope
you enjoy this and if not, go kill yourself, because nobody likes you.
Anyways, in this issue a lot more people submitted articles due to my
constant badgering and molestation :>. So, As always, b4b0 is the
freshmaker. Enjoy!

<jsbach> so7o, what do you know BEST about computers?
<jsbach> tell me
<so7o> i owned spice world
<proton> a 'buffer overflow' is when a piece of data overwrites the return
         pointer pushed onto the stack when entering a function, when the
         overwritten return pointer later is popped from the stack, the
         program executes abritrary code, usually resulting in a crash or
         core dump.
<shokkwave> Canul: just exploit the ones that are already +s
<Recharge> Just because you can hack doesn't mean you are a ahcker, even I
           know that.

As far as I know the ideas described in this article are original.  If
they aren't, or you have suggestions or comments, mail me at:

jsb4ch@hotmail.com

*[ Disclaimer ]*
Have some sort of imagination when reading this article.  The concepts
aren't the most practical or sane, but they illustrate a new way to think
about network resources.


*[ Network memory ]*

We can exploit the fact that the internet is slow, using
its latency as a temporary sort of local "memory".

When I send an ICMP echo datagram from my home in California
to a box in Korea, it usually takes between 2 and 5 seconds
before I get a reply.  During these few seconds, the ICMP header
and whatever data appended are "saved" on the network, albeit
not reliably.  Obviously, data being saved on a network
is completely different than data being saved on disk; we have
more and more complex problems to deal with when proposing to
swap pages to "network" memory.

The biggest problem with network memory is that you never know when
you'll be getting what you saved (to the network) back (by "saved to
the network" I mean encapsulated in a latent ICMP echo packet.)

For example: suppose we have only 4 bytes of memory (wh0a); All the bytes
are occupied, so we swap one byte that we aren't using to network memory,
by putting it in an ICMP echo and sending it off to Korea.  Now, we fill
the byte we just freed with a new value, and low and behold, our ICMP echo
is back again.  Now we have to discard it, because we have no room for
it.. So we have just lost our memory :(

Another problem is that even if we know when the ICMP echo
reply is coming back, and we make room for it (i'm just assuming
here that we have space in physical memory for it), there will have
been no point to having copied it out to the network in the first place,
because for the 5 seconds it was in transit, we couldn't free the memory
it once occupied (we needed a place to store the data once it was
returned.)

*[ Page juggling. ]*

(Definition: "swap to network memory" : To take memory, put it in an ICMP
echo datagram headed for a preferrably far-away [large RTT] host, and to
free the memory it occupied.)

I think page juggling addresses the problems stated in the previous
section.

The analogy is simple.  A juggler has two hands, and three juggling
balls.  As a rule he can hold only one ball in each hand, so he
must have at least one ball in the air at all times.
When the ball in the air decends upon the jugglers left hand, he throws
the ball in his left hand up into the air, so at this point there
are two balls in the air.  Now for a as-parallel-as-possible
computer analogy:

Suppose we have 3 pages (3 * 2048) of memory we need to store,
and the machine we're on only has 2 pages of physical memory.

[NOTE: Of course, A page is an arbitrary unit here, but when considering
 implementing page juggling in the virtual memory subsystem alongside
 page stealing (swapping pages to hard disk) its useful to think
 in terms of pages. Bleh. ]

To "juggle" the pages, we load 2 pages into the memory initially,
and swap one to network memory,  When we know the swapped page
is coming back (we discuss HOW we know when a swapped page is coming back
below...) we swap another page to network memory to make room for
the returning page.  If that was confusing read this paragraph again.

We can determine when our network-swapped page is coming back by
sampling the round trip time to the remote host frequently.  This
isn't very reliable, so we should allow for a large margin
of error when deciding when to swap off a page to make room for a
returning page.  This is obfuscated logic... Let's break this down into
steps.

0 seconds -> pages 1 & 2 loaded into physical memory

0  - 2048      2048 - 4096
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 p a g e   1 | p a g e   2 |
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -



0.01 seconds -> page 2 swapped to network memory,
                round trip time is sampled, it is 4 seconds.

0  - 2048      2048 - 4096
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 p a g e   1 | free space   |   (page 2 is in an ICMP echo en route for
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Korea.)



0.02 seconds -> page 3 swapped into the space page 2 occupied.

0  - 2048      2048 - 4096
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 p a g e   1 | p a g e   3  |   (page 2 is in an ICMP echo en route for
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Korea.)



3.01 seconds -> Page two will be back soon, so we swap page 1 to
                network memory to make room for it.

0  - 2048      2048 - 4096
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 free space   | p a g e   3 |   (pages 2 & 1 are in an ICMP echo en route for
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Korea.)

4 seconds -> Page 2 returns.

0  - 2048      2048 - 4096
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 p a g e   2 | p a g e   3  |   (page 1 is in an ICMP echo en route for
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Korea.)

et cetera.
.
.
.
*[ The effects. Good/bad/whatever. ]*

There are a number of very critical problems with the page juggling
concept.  For one, if you want to access memory in a page swapped
to network memory, you need to wait until the page returns, which could
be, at worst, a number of seconds.  And of course there is a
significant amount of overhead in CPU and bandwidth when you're sending a
lot of data all the time.

Networks weren't meant to hold data, they were meant to transport it.
If everyone used network memory as a sort of swap space, the
internet would be pretty fucked up!

Anyways, I think it would still be cool to hack linux to use network
memory as a ternary medium for page stealing, so that when swap space
ran out it could be used as a last resort.

*[ Implementing network latency page swapping in the kernel. ]*

The concepts behind page stealing in a generic UNIX kernel are
applicable with some modification to the concepts behind page juggling.

A brief description of page stealing:

When the kernel runs out of physical memory (RAM), it can "steal" pages
from processes, and put them on the hard disk, using it as a source of
secondary memory.  When the process wants to access a stolen page, it
is summoned up from the hard disk.  Pages of kernel memory aren't
swapped out, because a kernel that swaps in and out its own pages
would be pretty tangled :).  Since the hard disk has a much slower access
time (than RAM), we would like to swap out the pages that are accessed the
least frequently.  In many UNIX kernels, when a page is accessed, the
"dirty" bit in the page is set, telling the pager not to swap out this
page; it has been accessed recently.  The pager goes around and clears the
dirty bit off each page every so often.

We can take a page and swap it to the hard disk (duh).  But we can't
simply take a page and swap it to network memory, we need to swap pages in
pairs (this is what I call juggling).  Swapping a single page to network
memory is like tossing a ball up and down with one hand.. we gain nothing
from doing it.  Of course, we don't have to juggle pages in pairs, we
could use triplets, quadruplets, or whatever... But juggling pages 
in pairs doubles our local memory, whereas juggling triplets gives us a
%33 page gain, et cetera. For example: If we swap 2 megabytes of memory to
network, at any given time, 1 megabyte will be somewhere on the internet,
encapsulated in ICMP echo datagrams; this frees that 1 megabyte of memory.

Anyways, the point is, we need to implement an algorithm in the kernel
that finds two clean pages and juggles them.  We could latch onto the
existing page stealing subsystem to do this.

<gr1p> are you trying to imply that a media reporter would lie
<DethCraze> gr1p, I don't know, ask him.
<gr1p> i will
<gr1p> but first
<gr1p> i want your opinion on the matter

**************************************************
More allegations towards JP and AntiOnline *gasp*
**************************************************

<DethCraze> gr1p, "t0tal-ka0s" probably made up some story to get the
            spotlight off of them.
<jsbach> HAHAH those #tk guys rm'd it?
<DethCraze> Thats what I seriously think happened.
<gr1p> hmm.
<gr1p> i have a log
<gr1p> which says
<gr1p> you and venomous rm'd it
<DethCraze> Because paralyse gave me some logs of them talking about a
bunch of shit about prohosting.
<gr1p> no
<DethCraze> gr1p, I had nothing to do with it.
<DethCraze> Send me this log.
<gr1p> this was in #hackphreak.
<gr1p> dethcraze
<DethCraze> I never go into #hackphreak
<gr1p> the log is on that ircmostwanted.org site
<gr1p> dethcraze - um..don't u?
<gr1p> ah i forgot
<gr1p> your too badass for that

*********************************************************************
More allegations thrown at other people, this really is hotting up to
becoming a cr4zy conspiricy - THE JP/#TK AFFAIR.
*********************************************************************

<jsbach> check out www.coolio.org gr1p
<DethCraze> Coolio is a DoS kiddie.
<gr1p> and you are a rm -rf / kiddie.
<gr1p> now go to sleep or something
<gob_> hah
<gr1p> heh

***********************************************************************
End of conversation in #phrack, I think he gave up, decided he couldn't
win, so the conversation went into msg's

There you have it, that was enough for DethCraze as he put me on ignore.
Oh well, we spoke long enough for him to look foolish and thats all that
counts!
************************************************************************

===============================================================================

Many people have been asking for that script because they think DethCraze
is cool coz he got in AntiOnline.  Ok, here it is, I was thinking of
posting it to rootshell.com but i thought i'd make it a b4b0 exclusive!@#

<--------------------CUT HERE B4B0 LUBBIN GRRL13Z-------------------->

There ya have it....
The Decision is yours ---> ELITE or #HACKPHREAK?@#?

DethCraze can often be found idleing in #phrack efnet, so why not take
time out thos visit him and say h1 and ask him to teach you some of his
el8 rm'ing sk1llz....

0x0> introduction. |

Packet sniffers allow users to examine every packet that goes through
their ethernet.  If you have a PPP connection, you will be able
to intercept all data passing through your machine with a packet
sniffer.

Running a packet sniffer is a useful tool for debugging your network
code, or figuring out a foreign TCP/IP encapsulated packet
format.  The concepts behind writing a linux packet sniffer are
pathetically simple: any intermediate C programmer will have no
problem understanding them.

In this article we build a simple linux sniffer from the ground up,
leaving much room for improvement.







*****************************
0x1> socket(), SOCK_PACKET. |
*****************************

To open a socket in any POSIX compatible OS, we call the socket()
routine.  Socket() creates an endpoint for communication between
the kernel and a user process, using the standard file I/O syscalls
read() and write() as mechanisms for data transfer.  The prototype
for socket() looks like:

       int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

For internet sockets, the domain is always AF_INET.  The type varies.
For a TCP socket, you'd use SOCK_STREAM, for UDP, SOCK_DATAGRAM,
and for datalink access (the kind we're interested in) you'd
use SOCK_PACKET.  socket() returns a file descriptor that we
will use to read from the datalink.  Here is an example program
that opens a socket to the datalink, and exits:

#include <sys/socket.h> /* for SOCK_PACKET define. */
#include <linux/if_ether.h> /* for ETH_IP_ALL define. */

main()
{
int fd;

fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, htons(ETH_P_IP));
  /* the constant ETH_P_IP tells the kernel to pass our socket
     only IP datagrams. Just take my word for it. */

}





*****************************************************
<0x2 : Reading from the datalink. iphdr{}, tcphdr{}.
*****************************************************

Okay, great, we've opened a socket to the datalink.  But its no
use to us unless we actually read from it!  This is best explained
in an example:

struct packet {
  struct iphdr ipheader; /* IP header :duh: */
  struct tcphdr tcpheader; /* TCP header */
  char data[2048]; /* the data! */
  }sniffdpacket;
bzero(&sniffpacket, sizeof(struct packet)); /* fill out packet structure
                                            with zeros so we dont get some
                                            random data in there. */

fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, htons(ETH_P_IP)); /* same deal as b4. */

read(fd, &sniffpacket, 2088); /* this is where it all happens.. */

/* as you can see from the function below, all the fields in the structure
 * we just read() are properly aligned with the actual IP/TCP headers.
 * So, we can just evaluate data like this!!
 */
printf("Packet snatched from %s, going to %s, source port %d, dst port %d.\n",
        inet_ntoa(sniffpacket.ipheader.saddr),
        inet_ntoa(sniffpacket.ipheader.daddr),
        sniffpacket.tcpheader.source, sniffpacket.tcpheader.dest);

/************/

In the above code fragment, we opened a datalink socket, read from it,
and reported data about the packet.  Please make sure you understand
these concepts before moving on to the next section.  If you didn't
know, inet_ntoa() converts a network IP address to a dotted-decimal
ASCII IP address.

*****************************************************************
0x4> Putting it all together.  Building a small packet sniffer. |
*****************************************************************

A minimal packet sniffer should interpret the information read off the
datalink so that it is well organized and easily accessible, and report
important information back to the user.

As shown above, we can organize the data by declaring
struct packet { struct iphdr ipheader; struct tcphdr tcpheader; }.
Because C arranges the elements of structures in the memory in the
order in which you declare them, the fields in a real world IP
datagram read from the datalink will be inserted into the appropriate
variables in our structure when we read() into it.
Here is the packet sniffer:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

#include <sys/socket.h> /* for AF_INET and SOCK_PACKET. */
#include <linux/if_ether.h> /* for ETH_IP_ALL. */
#include <netinet/ip.h> /* for struct iphdr{} */
#include <netinet/tcp.h> /* for struct tcphdr{} */

main()
{
/* I certainly hope you know TCP/IP; but if you don't, an IP header
   contains routing information for an internet packet, and a
   TCP header contains connection oriented information.  The IP
   header "encapsulates" the tcp header.  We use this structure
   so that data we read() from the datalink will be easily accessible
   to us. */

int fd; /* to hold our sockets file descriptor. */

struct packet {
  struct iphdr ipheader;
  struct tcphdr tcpheader;
  char data[2048];
  }sniffpacket;
bzero(&sniffpacket, sizeof(struct packet)); /* fill out packet structure
                                            with zeros so we dont get some
                                            random data in there. */
fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, htons(ETH_P_IP)); /* same deal as b4. */

while(1)
{
read(fd, &sniffpacket, 2088);

printf("Packet snatched from %s, going to %s, source port %d, dst port
%d.\n",
        inet_ntoa(sniffpacket.ipheader.saddr),
        inet_ntoa(sniffpacket.ipheader.daddr),
        sniffpacket.tcpheader.source, sniffpacket.tcpheader.dest);
printf("Here is the data we intercepted:");
puts(sniffpacket.data);
} // repeat, FOREVER. :)

=== my acc0unt of the 1998 summer special-0lympiq games. ===

0kay so itz waz a hot summer day.

t34m b4b0 haz been getting ready for the 0lympicz for years now. f1nnally
their chance t0 make it b1g had c0me. yearz and yearz of practice and
experience h4ve f1nnally p4yed 0ff; for these were n0t just any
0lympiqz. these were the special 0lympiqz.

the g1mp gamez have b3gun! b4b0's main g0al iz to set a n3w standard
f0r the special 0lympiqs competition.  n0 more gimpz.  they are going to
trample up0n those l1mping one eyed crooked feet k1dz.  and m4ke them l00k l1ke
the pathetic human waste that they are.

0kay so the first event iz the joust.

j0ust had recently been added to the l1st of eventz f0r the special olymp1qz.
the f1rst tw0 who get to g0 at it iz b4b0'z very 0wn editor ge0rge.
ge0rge waz nervous ab0ut the event, but he haz sk1llz in j0usting.
wh0ever his opponant iz, i knew that ge0rge would trample up0n h1m.

ge0rge, the 6'1" 480 lb m4nw0man stepz 0nto hiz h0rse. l1ttle does he
kn0w hiz opponent would be 0ne of the m0st elite people to ever w4lk the
planet. yes. i kn0w what y0u are th1nk1ng. and y0u are r1ght. it iz so1o.

so1o the meek yet p0werful ch1ld w1ll meet h1z match t0day. so1o getz on
his horse and grabz his p0le.

ready s3t g0!

they are 0ff. ge0rge iz going full speed at so1o with hiz p0le aimed
right at h1z head.  l1ttle duz so1o kn0w that bef0re the m4tch, ge0rge
0wned so1o'z p0le with some 0day phf tekn1q. 4ll the sudden so1o fell 0ff
h1z horse and the m4tch was ge0rgez. c0ngratulationz ge0rge you w1n the
g0ld metal.  so1o, dripp1ng with sweat g0t off of h1z h0rse and screamed
that l0ckdown.sh w0uld own them all. but he waz 0nly laughed at by
ge0rge'z fans.  f0r they knew he had no sk1ll.

                           b4b0: 1 - g1mpz: 0


the n3xt event iz the j4ck1ng 0ff c0ntest.

the j4ck1ng off c0ntest cons1sts of only 1 rule: n0 h3lp.
the f1rst 0ne to sh00t his cum 1nt0 JP'z m0uth (h3 iz tied up to a p0le)
iz the w1nner.

the tw0 lucky pe0ple compet1ng against each 0ther are seegn4l and
0verdose.  0verdose iz very sk1lled at thiz, it c0uld be a h4rd m4tch f0r
seegn4l. but we w1ll never kn0w until itz 0ver.

4nd they're 0ff!.

0verdose surr0unded by p1cturez of 12 year 0ld girlz and b0yz iz sp4nking
it super f4st. th1z b0y must be fr0m the west s1de.  my l0rd i have never
seen any0ne j4ck off that f4st. 0h dear! before seegn4l even haz his pantz
off 0verdose is squirting JP all 0ver - th1s w4z timed at 1.84 sekondz..
g00d l0rd th4tz a sh0rt t1me. JP getz up, wh1le covered in s3m3n and then
proceeds to scream to the cr0wd "I AM NOT A HACKER.  I AM JUST SOMEONE
WHO LIKES IT IF YOU THINK I AM.  AND I CAN SHOOT MY LOAD IN 1.184
SECONDS SO FEAR."

..and that is exactly what b4b0 is doing now. ..for the games were tied.
oh no!. the final event is to start soon.

                       b4b0: 1 - g1mpz: 1


the f1nal and deciding event 1z n0w about to beg1n.  th1s c0uld crush
b4b0'z dreamz if they c4nt w1n it.  the cr0wd iz crazy and screaming with
restlessness. g0 b4b0 g0 b4b0!.  th3 f1nal ev3nt iz the 400 meter d4sh.
th1s inv0lves 4 players fr0m each team. and they pass thiz little p1pe
al0ng, to the next person (they 4ll have l1ke. precoordinated spotz on
the traq.. you know h0w it goes i'm sure. if not yer dumb.)

0kay so the pers0n starting the r4ce for b4b0 iz r4lph.  the pers0n racing
for the g1mpz is JP.  b4b0 iz wearing a t1ght red m0nkey outfit ..(h0w
s1lly). JP iz wearing an official antionline t-shirt. (this man iz a
homosexual).  the runnerz are set in their start p0siti0nz.

ready s3t g0.

JP beginz to limp slowly around the tr4ck.  the drool falling d0wn hiz
chin. what a pathetic m4n.  r4lph playfully walkz behind JP.  0h my g0d
whatz this! ralph iz spitting on JP. all 0ver. man. he probably doesnt
m1nd with all the s3m3n he's covered 1n. but thatz okay. ralph looks to be
getting bored..oh! ralph just knocked JP onto the ground and took his
shorts. and drew a m0nkey on his antionline t-shirt (i w0nder wh4t kind 0f
m4n would draw a m0nkey on a drooling gimpz shirt.)  ralph got t0 the next
pers0n and handed off the p0le to him. it waz tip. tip waz a fast runn3r.
he g0t b4b0 a nice lead in the r4ce while JP cr4wled to his teamate, so1o.
so1o and his wheelchair took off like a flash. when so1o getz busy, this
vain pops out of the s1de of hiz head. it makes him l00k silly. s0 anyway.
tEEp is 0nly a few yards ahead at this p0int and he is still g0ing at a
steady p4ce.  0nly one more person t0 h4nd off to.  ky00 w4z waiting on
the tr4ck t0 get the p0le. as tip came running up to him, he s4w s01o and
his wheelchair flying t0wards him, as s00n as he got the pole, he put it
int0 so1o's spokes on hiz wheelchair, sending him face first 1nt0 the big
pool 0f urine and feces.  w3 all kn0w what THAT means.

0kay so ky00 iz now running down the track l1ke a b4t 0ut of h3ll.
beh1nd him iz a big b4d overd0se.  n0w. we all kn0w 0verdose has no
skillz, n0 common sense, and n0 friends.  s0 qytp0 was g0ing to exploit th4t.
as 0verdose was running, ky00 stopped him, n0 one could hear what Qytpo
was saying to h1m.  0h my g0d!. whats thiz!? 0verdose iz n0w pulling down
his pants. and ky00 iz greeting that with a grin. 0h my. in the 28 years
of special olympics i have never seen 4nyth1ng l1ke this.  0h l0rd! n0t
only iz he pull1ng d0wn h1z pants. but he iz bend1ng over w1th hiz ass
pointed straight at ky0o.

Qytpo must have seen this as a great opportunity. (n0t to run to the
finish l1ne silly. but t0 fuq overdose up the 4ss.)  l1ttle did 0verdose
know, how r0ugh ky00 really waz.

(el4psed t1me..a f3w h0urz perhaps..)

0verd0se iz l4ying 0n the gr0und in p41n n0w. and ky0o iz str0ll1ng t0
the f1n1sh l1ne.  h0ray. b4b0 w1ns. the g1mpz might h4ve h4d a chance, if
0nly 0verdose wasnt quite the h0m0sexual that he waz. oh well. itz okay
to be g4y. really.

                        AND THAT IZ B4BO TEKNIQUE VAYVEE

ASM - Part 1
------------

A lot of people has been asking me what is ASM and how does the language differ
from other programming language.Well this is an article to give you a basic
knowledge of ASM is all about.

ASM is stands for assembly as in a low-level programming language and compared
to C and the rest this is in counted as a 2nd Generation Programming Language
where else the 1st Generation Programming Language is "Machine CODE".

Let's talk about the registers.

General Purpose Registers
-------------------------
- AX as accumulator register
- BX as base register
- CX as count register
- DX as data register

The above are just the primary functions of these registers.They can be used in any
fashion at the programmer's disposal,i.e. BX can be used as data register if needed to.
These 16-bit registers can still be reference as high and low nibble of 8-bit each.

|------16-bit AX------|
 _____________________
| 8-bit AH | 8-bit AL |
 ---------------------

Segment Registers
-----------------
Intel 8086 keeps data and code in memory using different segments up to 64K in size
- CS as code segment register
- DS as data segment register
- ES as extra segment register
- SS as stack segment register

To access to a particular memory address, the segment-offset pair is used,i.e.
A284:05F2, where segment is A284 and offset 05F2.

Index Registers
----------------
- SI as source index register
- DI as destination index register

These are used generally for string operations with association with the DS and ES register.

Pointer Registers
------------------
- SP as stack pointer
- BP as base pointer
- IP as instruction pointer

The SP is used with association with SS; BP is used to facilitate referencing
parameters passed via the stack; and IP keeps track of the location of current
instruction.

Flag Register
-------------
In this case only 9 out of 16-bit reguster are used.
- OF (overflow) bit
set if overflow

- DF (direction) bit
clear for normal lower-to-upper direction and upper-to-lower if set

- IF (interrupt) bit
disable interrupts when clear

- TF (trap) bit
set to tell processor to execute in single-step trace mode. Used only in debugger

- SF (sign) bit
clear when positive and set when negative

- ZF (zero) bit
set when results of arithmetic operation or comparison is zero

- AF (auxiliary carry) bit
set if arithmetic causes a carry out of bit3. Use in ASCII and BSD packed
fields only

- PF (parity) bit
an odd parity bit that is not commonly in use

- CF (carry) bit
result of carry in arithmetic operation

This an example of the flag register:-

15  14  13  15  11  10  09  08  07  06  05  04  03  02  01  00
                OF  DF  IF  TF  SF  ZF      AF      PF      CF

              The group "b4b0" suspected in Nairobi bombing

   By NATION Reporter
   and Agencies

   Yesterday, three members of the electronic magazine (b4b0) staff were
   arrested by United States Federal Marshalls on the suspicion that these
   self-proclaimed "wankers of the electronic frontier" were responsible
   for the bombing of the US Embassy in Kenya.

   One of the men, a "ge0rge" as he calls himself, was imprisoned for
   resisting arrest. He commented later that, he had no donuts, dynamite,
   or coffee and that he was being unjustly treated because he was an
   orthodox jew. These allogations were denied by the US Marshalls.

   Another One of the men - it was not stated which - was said by
   Pakistani officials to be "a pivotal participant" in the bombing which
   killed 247 people and left more than 5,000 injured. We don't know his
   exact name but b4b0 refers to him as "r4lph."

   A near-simultaneous car bomb attack outside the US embassy in Tanzania
   killed 10 people. b4b0 was also suspected there.

   One of the suspects had been identified by Mohammed Saddiq Howaida,
   ("phFh4Ck3r" known by b4b0) the suspect arrested in Pakistan on the
   day of the bombings, August 7, and flown blindfolded back to Nairobi.

   A statement issued by the FBI and Nairobi CID read: "The FBI and CID
   confirm that searches were conducted at the Hill Top in Nairobi on
   Tuesday.

   "The investigation is proceeding in a logical manner and no further
   comment will be made at this time."

   After his arrest, pHfh4ck3r, 12, a Palestinian from Jordan, described
   the terrorist network he allegedly works for to Pakistani officials,
   according to the authoritative Washington Post newspaper.

   phfh4ck3r said the bombing was sponsored by Saudi millionaire "tEEp"
   whose group consisted of 4,000 to 5,000 heavily armed terrorists who
   operated full-time in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia and
   Somalia, as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the paper said.

   phfh4ck3r told the Pakistani officials that tEEp had a large
   arsenal of surface-to-air missiles, mortars, vibrators, sheep-skin
   condems, islamic women, rabbis, rockets and tanks, stored all over
   Afghanistan because they threatened his dog "Fluffems."

   He also said that tEEp's operatives in the past were sent to
   carry out armed actions abroad, including the 1993 hit-and-run attacks
   on US forces in Somalia, which he called the terrorist network's
   "biggest victory".

   Kenyan and US investigators said earlier that phFh4ck3r had not
   admitted any responsibility to them in the Nairobi bombing or in the almost
   simultaneous one at the US embassy in Dar es Salaam.

   The Washington Post reported that phFh4ck3r told the Pakistanis he was
   an engineer who had been sent to Kenya to provide technical and
   logistical support for the bombing, but that he had been instructed to
   leave Kenya hours before the blast.

   He, however, denied this to the Kenyans and the FBI because he knew
   that any admission of a crucial part in the bombing would bring a
   death sentence, sources said.

   The US government has demanded tEEp's extradition from
   Afghanistan, warning the Taliban government that it can expect no
   international recognition until it hands him over. The Taliban
   rejected the request, according to reports in Islamabad, the Pakistan
   capital.

   "We will never hand tEEp over to anyone and protect him with our
   blood at all cost," the b4b0 (b4b0!) quoted Taliban editor-in-chief
   ge0rge as saying.

   ge0rge added: "The US intelligence and investigation agencies find it
   convenient to blame tEEp to cover up their own failures."

'America Will Not Retreat': Excerpts From Tributes


 Federal Document Clearinghouse
 Friday, August 14, 1998; Page A30

 President Clinton:

   There may be more hard road ahead, for b4b0 target America
   because we act and stand for peace and democracy, because the spirit
   of our country is the very spirit of freedom. It is the burden of our
   history and the bright hope of the world's future.

   We must honor the memory of those we mourn today by pressing the cause
   of freedom and justice for which they lived.

   We must continue to stand strong for freedom on every continent.
   America will not retreat from the world and all its promises nor
   shrink from our responsibility to stand against b4b0(tm) and with the
   friends of freedom everywhere. We owe it to those we honor today.

   As it is written, their righteous deeds have not been forgotten. Their
   glory will not be blotted out. Their bodies were buried in peace, but
   their names shall live forever.

Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright:

   Terror can turn life to death, laughter to tears and shared hopes to
   sorrowful memory. It can turn a building to rubble, but it cannot
   change America's determination to lead or to strive with others to
   build a world where there is more hope and prosperity, freedom, peace,
   and no b4b0.

   Make no mistake, terror is the tool of b4b0. It is not a form of
   political expression, and certainly not a manifestation of religious
   faith.

   It is murder, plain and simple. And those who perpetrate it, finance
   it or otherwise support it must be opposed by all decent people.

   Rest assured, America will continue to be present around the world
   wherever we have interests to defend, friends to support, and work to
   do.

   America will not be intimidated by b4b0. We will maintain our commitments
   to the people of Africa. We will do all we can to protect our diplomatic
   and military peoples around the world.

   U.S. OFFERS UP TO 4 MILLION DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT "b4b0"

   The U.S. Department of State offers substantial rewards for
   information preventing acts of international terrorism against United
   States persons or property done by b4b0. The reward level is up to
   $4 million when U.S. civil aviation is targeted by b4b0.

   The Counter-b4b0 Rewards Program was established by the 1984 Act
   to Combat b4b0z elite reign, Public Law 98-533. Under the Rewards
   Program, cooperating individuals ("narqz") and their immediate
   family members may be relocated to the U.S., or elsewhere, and they are
   assured complete confidentiality. Rewards, totaling millions of
   dollars, have been paid in dozens of cases. Innocent lives have been
   saved and b4b0-wannabez put behind bars because they got kaught.

   In 1994, Congress expanded the definition of "international
   terrorism", authorizing rewards for information regarding "...any act
   substantially contributing to b4b0s acquisition of unsafeguarded
   special nuclear material or any nuclear explosive device.

------[ Seccon '98 ]-----

        After a long period of waiting time and organisation, it's
happened. Australia's first hack con took place at the ANA Hotel, Sydney.
I took the one hour flight down to Sydney on the morning of the con,
something I came to regret due to my late night the night before.

        I arrived in Sydney and caught a cab to the ANA, where I was due
to speak in about 15 minutes. I was fairly late, and some fed was talking
about hacking and the law when I arrived. I scanned the audience and
found that the con in itself was more formal than perhaps I had hoped.
Without much further ado, the fed con cluded his speech and I was thrown
into the limelight. I covered the basics of NT security and common attack
methods, just old regurgitated stuff basically.

        After I gave my talk, I then met up with a good friend from irc,
duke.  We had arranged to meet before my talk but due to both of our late
arrivals we had to wait till after my blurb. I was foll owed by some
Microsoft security dood who rambled on for the next half an hour over
nothing important.

        Duke and I were basically talking out in the forum during morning
tea, and we were getting heaps of kudos and business cards and stuff which
was pretty neat. We actually got some pretty coo l job offers too, with
really good pay, but that doesn't matter. The conference then resumed with
talks on virii and anti-v irii techniques, but I found that quite boring
since virii doesn't interest me in the slightest. I had hoped to play ar
ound on the network while the boring speeches were on, but the isdn modems
weren't working. :/

        Duke and I had to leave the first day early because he had a
guitar lesson and I was staying with him. We got back to his house and I
sat on irc while he got schooled in guitar techniques :> So then duke came
home and we both sat on irc, heh. Duke then coded an updated version of
his qpop scanner and released it to rootshell, I dont think it got posted
:/.

  So after a night of coding and breaking stuff, duke and I woke up early
to venture to what prospered as a more invigorating day than the first had
been with the network up and Julian Assange (proff) giving a talk on
deniable cryptography. So the geek fest (I got that off sewid) proceeded
on and more cra p was spoken. A bunch of guys took part in some kind of
wargame where they had to break past a firewall or something but e nded up
taking down their own router with a DoS attack.

        Anyway that's my short and sharp account of Seccon98 for what it's
worth. Their site is at www.seccon.org

A *BRIEF* Intro to the Linux Kernel

- aqua -


This article will not provide you with specific details about the Linux
kernel.  Its purpose is to depart some general ideas about the kernel and
show you how to obtain more detailed information on select topics.
Hopefully, you'll finish reading this article and know a bit more about
how your operating system works.


- Multitasking -
Definitions:
 process - a program that is executing.
 kernel stack - every process has a kernel stack.  It's purpose is to provide
                space for kernel operations on a process.  It is transparent
                (invisible from the programmers perspective), and only visible
                by the kernel.

One of the most important properties of the linux kernel is its ability to
run multiple programs simultaneously.  It does this by "time slicing",
or only executing a process for a fraction of a second, then moving onto
another process, then another, in an infinite loop until the computer is
turned off.  The CPU is responsible for generating an interrupt every 10ms
that tells the kernel to start dealing with a different process.

 1ms...................30ms
[ ls ] [ find ] [ BitchX ]

(the kernel executes each of these programs for only 10ms before moving onto
the next.)

Switching a process into context" means arranging the kernel stack
and registers so that the process can begin to be operated on by the CPU.
"Switching a process out of context" means arranging a process and it's
kernel stack so that the CPU can begin operating on the next process in queue.

When a process is switched out of context, it's registers, among other things,
are backed up on the kernel stack so that they don't get clobbered by
subsequent processes.  When the process is switched back in, the registers
are popped out of the kernel stack and operation begins again.

In the linux kernel, a process is defined by struct task_struct.  Read this
structure for further information.

*[* System Calls *]*
Definitions -

The kernels only purpose in life is to provide services to programs running
on the computer.  From the programmers perspective, the kernels services
can be accessed via system calls such as fork(), write(), read(), and
execve() to name a few. System calls are called as normal libc routines,
because they are "wrapped" by libc.  A syscall is expanded by libc via
the macros _syscall1, _syscall2, _syscall3, etc, where the number is the
number of arguments to the system call.  _syscallX macros take the
arguments to the function, push them into their appropriate registers,
and call int $0x80, initiating a software interrupt to jump into kernel
mode.


*[* Paging, memory management, etc. *]*

In the linux, a user processes memory, as viewed from a C program, spans from
zero to X.  Obviously, address 0 in a user process is not the first address in
physical memory... So the process is sorta operating on a "virtual machine."
(it thinks it's the only process on the machine.)  A process operates on
"virtual memory", but so does the kernel, at its higher layers, anyways.

The virtual memory subsystem allows memory to be addressed consequetively,
without holes or gaps.  For example :

Physical memory [1 - 4000   [ hole ]  5000 - 10026                    ]
Virtual memory  [1                   -                   10026  ]


So as you can see, addressing virtual memory is much more convenient, because
we aren't restrained by the physical limitations of memory.  Indeed, we could
address HIGHER than physical memory allows us to, and the virtual memory
subsystem would swap pages to the hard disk to allocate more memory.. And
this would all be transparent above the virtual memory subsystem.

Most of the kernel, besides the actual memory management subsystem, addresses
virtual memory.

"Page stealing" involves moving pages to hard disk once physical memory is
exhausted.

Pages on hard disk can't be operated on by the CPU (duh) so they need to be
swapped BACK into memory when a process tries to access them.  Having said
this, it should be obvious that we'd like to swap pages to disk that won't
be accessed in the near future.  The algorithm used to guess what pages
are accessed infrequently is quite simple... When a page is accessed,
the "dirty bit" is set, and when time comes to swap a page to disk,
a page that doesn't have the dirty bit set is swapped ( it's assumed
this page won't be accessed soon ).  Every once an awhile the paging
subsystem goes around and clears the dirty bit off of every page.




OK, that's it!@&$!@$ if you found this interesting, please read a book on
kernel internals... Or read some of the linux kernel src@&$^!@*& BYE
