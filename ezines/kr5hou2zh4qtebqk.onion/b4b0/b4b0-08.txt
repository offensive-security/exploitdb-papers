  normalcy.  the everyday lullness of life never seems to have had its
way with the most of the lot; yet most seem content with it.  the end of
the ways of the truth are burdened upon the ordinary soul.  how does one
overcome this?  how can one look to the sky and exclaim, 'free me from
my burdened life!  i want to taste the impeccable taste of liberation!
i want to live life to its fullest!'  however, these cries of help remain
unanswered.  it is with the implementation of 'Ultimate B4B0' that one
can attain a higher spiritual sense of being.  Ultimate B4B0 is the way.
freedoms gathered from the broad regions of the earth come forward to
kiss the poor man's feet.  and yet there is a whirling dervish of
implication that freedoms lie unburied within the soul.  the simple
answer is to let these out.  it is with Ultimate B4B0, that this is
acheived.

Article Six: Liberation of Normalcy

  The dead ringers of stalled time reign supreme in the ears of the countless
masses hushed in soothing solitude.  How does it end like this ... life with-
out the fervor of embellishment?  If you do refer to Article One: Ultimate
B4B0, you will find stated, "The liberation of the fallacy known as normalcy
is not only limited to one cause ... comprised of many individuals designed
to help the resurrection of vice."

  It is with this Resurrection of Vice that all is possible.  It is not
merely another term for the all-endearing, "Ultimate B4B0," rather the
appraisal of the senses into depths never before explored.  The Resurrection
of Vice is the freedom that will surround you and free you of your shackles.

  It is with the Essence of B4B0, the "Golden Calf" which makes the im-
possible possible.  A sight to behold, the "Golden Calf" not only holds the
entrails of the residual embellishment of life, but represents the fine
line between religion and empowerment.  The power of the Essence of B4B0
truly is a force to be reckoned with; teenage girls quiver with bent knees
merely at the mention of its name.  Grown men have been known to cause
"disco dump" overhearing its name.

  And it is with the devout study of B4B0's theology that makes everything
in life easier to understand.  Ultimate B4B0 makes this possible.  The
Resurrection of Vice makes this possible.  The Essence of B4B0 (the "Golden
Calf") makes this possible.

  It is up to the practitioner of B4B0, on how far does the liberation of
normalcy goes.

! Bitslice DES !                                                       smiler
~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#

  The Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been a worldwide standard for 20
years.  Although it is showing signs of old age, it has held up remarkably
well against years of cryptanalysis. Recently two cryptanalysis
techniques - Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis - have emerged that can
greatly lower the complexity of an attack on DES.  However they are
generally regarded to be impractical against full 16-round DES, requiring
2^47 chosen plaintexts or 2^55 known plaintexts.  Most of the time you
will only know one plaintext block (and the cyphertext block it
corresponds to). So at the moment the best way to discover the key is by
brute force. The keyspace is sufficiently small (2^56) for a brute force
attack to be viable. This of course means you will need at least one
block of plaintext.

  The NSA is believed to have hardware implementations of DES that can
brute force the entire key-space in as little as a day. Probably less.
However because of the huge expense, most people will most probably only
be able to get hold of a software implementation of DES. These are of
course much slower. Nearly every single operation in DES involves swapping
individual bits between 64-bit words - your average 32-bits microprocessor
is not particularly good at this. A simple minded implementation would take
~200 cycles to complete just one expansion permutation, where as in
hardware it would take something closer to 5 clock cycles. And even with
amazingly cunning optimisations (see Eric Young's DES lib) a software
implementation is always going to be a fair bit slower. Until recently
Eric Young's DES implementation was the fastest around, until somebody
came up with Bitslice DES. But everybody still uses Eric Young's library
because Bitslice is only suitable for a brute force key search.

  Before I dive straight in to bitslice DES, I'll explain very briefly the
workings of DES. In DES, a block is 64 bits long. The right half of the
plaintext block is combined with a 48-bit subkey extracted from the actual
key to give a 48-bit output. This passes through an "S-box substitution",
consisting of 8 S-boxes, each of which take a 6-bit input and give a 4-bit
output. Hence a 48-bit input block goes to a 32-bit output block.
Traditionally each of these S-boxes are thought of as table lookup
operations.  Each entry in the box is a 4-bit number. 2 of the input bits
determine the row, the other 4 determine the column. This, with a few
other operations constitutes one round of DES. In full DES there are 16
rounds.

  If you want more information on DES and cryptography in general, I
would suggest buying Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography", although
there a few cryptography pages scattered around the web. If you just want
a simple, fast(ish) implementation of DES, then Eric Young's SSLeay is
probably your best bet, it can be found at ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL.

  In software it is the S-Boxes that are the bottleneck in terms of speed.
So most software implementations simply represent each S-box as a table
of 64 values (referenced by the 6 input bits). Software implementations
also make optimisations to speed up the other operations like the
Expansion, Key, Initial and Final permutations. But however fast these
are, they are still just souped up versions of the original DES
implementation.

  Bitslice takes a new approach. Instead of encrypting one block at a
time, Bitslice DES can encrypt 32 blocks in parallel (or 64 blocks,
depending on the size of the processor word). This isn't quite as fast as
it sounds, as each operation is done one bit at a time.  Various tradeoffs
mean that on a 64-bit processor, the bitslice implementation is from 1.5
to 3 times faster than the fastest DES libraries. Bitslice on a 32-bit
processor is usually marginally slower than the fastest normal DES
encryption program.

  It is kind of difficult to explain in words how the plaintext blocks
are arranged, so I've come up with a couple of diagrams to illustrate it.
Think of a processor word as going across. So normally, each block is
stored in its own word. But in bitslice, each block goes vertically
downwards, with corresponding bits from different blocks being stored in
the same word. Note this is how both the plaintext blocks, and the key
blocks are arranged.


-----[ Ordinary Software Implementations:

------------
| 0 --- 63 | Block 0
------------
     .
     .

| 0 --- 63 | Block 63

-----[ Bitslice Implementation:

-------
|00|00| ...
-------
|01|01| ...
-------
 .   .
 .   .
-------
|63|63| ...
-------

 The advantage with the bitslice implementation is that each individual
bit(for all blocks at the same time) can be accessed quickly in software,
so all the expansion,p-box and compression permutations are considerably
faster, not least because they  are done 64 times in parallel. If for
instance you XOR 2 words together, then you effectively are performing XOR
64 times in parallel, albeit 1 bit at a time. So with this method
everything becomes much simpler and faster.

  The main bottleneck again is the S-boxes. The lookup tables needed to
perform an S-box substitution would be enormous(2^376 bytes) and would
make bitslice unviable. So instead of thinking of S-Boxes as lookup
tables, they are thought of as digital circuits, such that given the 6
input bits, they will give the 4 output bits specified by the S-Box.
This digital circuit can be composed solely of AND, OR and NOT gates (its
a law of boolean algebra). Optimisations can be made so that it is
composed of NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR gates. Note that in x86 assembly there
aren't any distinct instructions for NAND, NOR, XNOR, so you have to chain
an ordinary gate with a NOT gate. However, other less crappy architectures
do have these gates, and bitslice can be optimised for these.

  People have suggested using Karnaugh Maps (a method for constructing
a digital circuit from a table of values) for this but, for a 6 bit input,
Karnaugh Maps are quite difficult to do. So I prefer to use normal boolean
algebra. I won't go too deeply into this but I'll just show you how you
can make a digital circuit if you only have 3 input bits and 1 output bit.

Ph33r the ascii notation.

A.B = A AND B
A + B = A OR B
A^B = A XOR B
_
A = NOT A

Here are some useful identities, check the truth tables if you want...
_ _   _______
A.B = (A + B)
_   _   _____
A + B = (A.B)
  _   _
A.B + A.B = A ^ B
_ _         _______
A.B + A.B = (A ^ B)
      _______   _______
A.B + (A + B) = (A ^ B)

A.B + B = B
_
A + A = 1

Take as an example this table of values:

A | B | C | Q |
---------------
0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

One way (and I must stress this is only one way) to make a digital
circuit, is to take all the combinations that give an output of 1 and form
AND gates for each combination:

_ _ _   _   _   _         _ _
A.B.C + A.B.C + A.B.C + A.B.C + A.B.C  = Q
    _        _ _     _       _ _
B.C(A + A) + B.C(A + A) + B.(A.C) = Q
      _ _     _______
B.C + B.C + B.(A + C) = Q
_______     _______
(B ^ C) + B.(A + C) = Q

  Note that if I had used a Karnaugh Map I would have ended up with more
gates, because there is no method for using XOR gates with a Karnaugh Map.
This has never really been a problem, I guess, because XOR gates are more
expensive in simple digital circuits, but in software all the gates have
an equal weighting.

  So that gives a final equation with only 6 gates (count them) even if we
aren't allowed NOR or XNOR gates. Of course in this case there were 5
True output bits, so it would probably have been best to make an equation
that represented the False output bits, and NOT the whole thing. If you
want that represents 6 input bits, you can simple chain them together.
For instance if D, E and F represented the last 3 bits you could
say that:
_ _ _       _ _         _   _
D.E.F(Q1) + D.E.F(Q2) + D.E.F(Q3) + .... + D.E.F(Q8)

  Where Qn is the gate circuit you've calculated based on that particular
subset of values. You can then simplify as you wish. Remember that if you
have many repeated expressions, you can store the results in memory and
use them again.

  To get a four bit output, the best way that I know of is to just do the
process four times over, although there will be plenty of redundancy
between the four circuits.  And then once you've got one S-box, there's
still another 7 to go, HEH, so its a lot of work.

  The aim as you might have guessed is to get the gate count as low as
possible, as this would obviously make bitslice even faster. A
simple(ish) gate circuit will still contain 150 gates, but it can
lowered to somewhere between 50 and 60 (a record held by a Matthew Kwan).
The topic is still, as far as I know, wide open - nobody knows for sure
what the fastest combination of gates is (and I doubt nobody will).
Also if you do find a combination with less gates, there are still issues
to deal with like the fact that x86 logic instructions only take 2 operands
(unlike sparc and alpha asm). Meaning that the output is put into one of
the input registers, so we can not naively transpose a digital  circuit
onto assembly code. And there is also the fact that there are a limited
number of registers, so which values do we hold in the registers, and
which values do we hold in the stack ? Bear in mind that in 486 asm it
takes from 2 to 3 times longer to perform a logic operation if one of the
operands is a pointer to memory, depending on which is the first operand.
And in 386 asm it is even worse, taking 3 to 4 times longer.  So there is
always room for improvement, over even the smallest gate circuit.

  If you want a real live implementation of bitslice DES, there is one at
www.darkside.com.au/bitslice, or you can always check out John the Ripper
which also has a bitslice implementation (derived from Matthew Kwan's
code I believe).

Thanks to Matthew Kwan for helping me with this concept.

~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#

When Dr. Ousterhout wrote the Tcl language, he built the interpreter as a
library. This means that you can use Tcl to script your programs really
fucking easily!

The Library:

struct Tcl_Interp - This is the data structure used by the library to
represent an interpreter. All functions will use it in some way.

Tcl_Interp *Tcl_CreateInterp() - This function sets an interpreter up so
that it is ready for evaluation.

int Tcl_EvalFile(Tcl_Interp *X, char *NAME) - Uses X as the interpreter in
which to run the commands found in the file whose address is contained in
NAME, runs the commands and returns either TCL_OK, or TCL_ERROR.

int Tcl_VarEval(Tcl_Interp *X, char *INST1, char *INST2..(char*)0) -
Creates a script comprised of the commands found in INST1,2,3,etc. until
it reaches the null pointer, runs the script, and again, returns either
TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR.

interp->result - This member of the structure holds a message regarding
the result of running the script, it will give you the details o any
errors if TCL_ERROR is returned by one of the int functions.

void Tcl_CreateCommand(Tcl_Interp *X, char *NAME, Tcl_CmdProc *CMD,
ClientData ARGS, Tcl_CmdDeleteProc *DEL) -This function, while inside of
X, allows you to call the C function named in CMD through scripts using
the new tcl command NAME, ARGS will be the arguments to the function, and
DEL will be called if you delete the function from X.

int Tcl_DeleteCommand(Tcl_Interp *X, char *NAME) - deletes command NAME
from interpreter X

Incase none of that made sense, here is a bit of code that uses all but
interp->result and Tcl_VarEval.

ghay.c:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <tcl.h>
/*
ghay.c by Likk3r
*/
int ghay(ClientData poop, Tcl_Interp *ghay, int argc, char *argv[]){
        if(argc==2){
                 printf(argv[1]);
        }
return TCL_OK;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
        int rumncoke;
        Tcl_Interp *b4b0;
        if(argc>=2){
                b4b0=Tcl_CreateInterp();

Tcl_CreateCommand(b4b0,"ghay",ghay,(ClientData)0,(Tcl_CmdDeleteProg*)0);
                rumncoke=Tcl_EvalFile(b4b0, argv[1]);
        }
return 0;
}

A little bit of Tcl testing it out:
#!/root/ghay
foreach thing {b4b0 is the shit} {
        ghay $thing
        ghay "\n"
}

If everything is compiled, and the script is executable, you should see
this:
#./test.tcl
b4b0
is
the
shit

! Introduction to MC/Serviceguard (Part One) !                            tip
~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@~!@#$!@#$!@

With the advent of "high availibility," uptime is the critical word.  How can
one maintain uptime with a network interface goes bad?  How about disk
failure?  How about CPU failure?  How about software failure?

Enter MC/Serviceguard, for HP9000/s800's.  What MC/Serviceguard does is
cluster a networked group of HPs (called nodes) running applications/volume
groups (called packages).  These nodes will detect if one of them fails
(networking, CPU, etc).  Of course you can do simply NIC failover on a
single box as well.

Typically, the nodes are on two or more networks, in case of failure on one
network.  A "heartbeat" signal is sent on one (or more) of these networks to
insure that connectivity is operational.  A backup heartbeat may be
configured on an RS232 serial line as well (and can also be used to reduce
load on your network).

Here is a visual on the network configuration:


         --------------             ---------------
         |   node A   |             |    node B   |
         |            |             |             |
         | 1  H  S  F |             | F  S  H  1  |
         --------------             ---------------
           |  |  |  |---- failover ---|  |  |  |
           |  |  --------- serial --------  |  |
           |  -------- heartbeat lan --------  |
           ------------ primary lan ------------

Note: primary lan fails over to failover, in case of failure on any of the
network cards on primary lan.  You may also have an additional card for
additional networks (and have a failure card associated with each one).
The heartbeat lan is a private vlan associated with the nodes for the
heartbeat only, although you may have this on your primary lan (or serial).

You may use 10/100BT or FDDI.  The heartbeat detects connectivity between
the machines.

In terms of disk failure, nodes may be connected to disks (packages) via SCSI
(single ended or fast/wide) (max: 4 nodes) or fiber-channel (ie, on an EMC
frame) (max: 16 nodes, which is the maximum for MC/Serviceguard).  Typically
packages are setup so that the nodes share them.

Here is a visual layout on the package configuration:

         ---------------                            ---------------
         |   node A    |                            |    node B   |
         |             |                            |             |
         | root disk   |-- pkg A --- pkg B mirror --|  root disk  |
         | root mirror |                            | root mirror |
         |             |-- pkg A mirror --- pkg B --|             |
         ---------------                            ---------------

Now in the above example, nodes A and B contain their own root disks and
root mirrors.  Package A and B and their mirrors are on both nodes.  Package
A is run normally on node A and package B is run normally on node B.  In the
event of a failure on node A, node B assumes the responsibilities of both
packages A and B.

Obviously in the event of a hardware or software failure of package A,
MC/Serviceguard may switch to the mirror.

Of course with the above examples, you are not limited to two nodes.  As said
before, maximum node availability is limited by use of SCSI or fiberchannel.
An ideal setup would involve use of a private vlan and serial line for
heartbeat, with a primary and failover NIC for each network.

That's it for Part One.  It's rather short, but is groundwork for Part Two,
which will go into software components and monitors.

i went to the coffee shop the other day, and ordered a vanilla hazelnut
latte.  there's nothing like a particular breeze in the sunny afternoon, how
the wind ruffles your fur and sparkles in the rippling water.  this particul-
ar afternoon was a perculiar one, if any.  basically two furry kids came into
the shop, smoking their cigarettes and laughing.  there were talking about
how there was nothing in common between rabbits and squirrels.  suddenly,
this huge squirrel walked in.  he ordered a amaretto cappucino and sat beside
me.  "hear the story about wood owl?" he asked me.  "no," i replied, as i
sipped my latte.  he smiled grimly, and shook my hand.  "i'm fluffy
squirrel," he exclaimed.  "what a coincidence.  i'm fluffy c. bunny," i
answered back.  in a twitch of the eye, he started banging his head on the
counter.  "i want to have a pissy fit about the whole world, wrapped in
onion skins, with a twist of lemon!" he screamed at the top of his lungs.  i
smiled bitterly and cried Mozart.  the two kids observed us, and started
hopping up and down as fast as they could, eventually hitting their heads on
the ceiling.  wood owl came into the shop, busting in with air of importance.
"i've got belgathytic news!" he screamed.  two the kids started bouncing into
each other.  "psychopathic duty!" screamed fluffy squirrel as he started
jumping up and down.  i couldn't help but to laugh madly; uncontrollably as i
coughed up last night's carrot stew dinner.  the room heaved with an old,
tired screak.  the clerk shouted, "there's no more time for meal time! i
can't help it!  help the proxy sucker one less hurt left but hurt less

knowledgable.  oh golly.

After some testing on virtual servers with Microsoft's IIS/4.0, I learned
that they had made some changes to it. It turns out they had made it more
compliant to RFC2617... or did they? From the onset of diagnostics, it looks
as though they didn't.

Here is the problem. When set the virtual server with WWW-Authenticate with
clear-text, its realm uses the IP address of the server. The only way to
change this is to use Microsoft's IIS Resource Kit's Meta database editor.
This can be fine for most companies, but most E-Commerce have their web
servers behind firewalls with local directors. So what ends up happening is
anyone can get the internal IP address of the server, then knowing the
internal network segment. From there you can do many things to get into
the network.

I had spoken with Microsoft about this problem. They had told me that many
people had complained about it, but it is due to using RFC standards. That's
funny, because other web servers are not subject to this. To see if a server
is subject to this, all is needed to do is:

Example:
telnet webserver.com 80
HEAD /

Reply:
HTTP/1.0 403 Access Forbidden
Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 172
Date: SAT, 12 JUN 1999 17:17:20 GMT
Connection: close

If it was a virtual server with password with clear-text, the realm= would
have their IP address.

The 401 (Unauthorized) response message is used by an origin server
to challenge the authorization of a user agent. This response MUST
include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing at least one
challenge applicable to the requested resource. The 407 (Proxy
Authentication Required) response message is used by a proxy to
challenge the authorization of a client and MUST include a Proxy-
Authenticate header field containing at least one challenge
applicable to the proxy for the requested resource.

      challenge   = auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param

Note: User agents will need to take special care in parsing the WWW-
Authenticate or Proxy-Authenticate header field value if it contains
more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header
field is provided, since the contents of a challenge may itself
contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters.

The authentication parameter realm is defined for all authentication
schemes:

      realm       = "realm" "=" realm-value
      realm-value = quoted-string

The realm directive (case-insensitive) is required for all authentication
schemes that issue a challenge. The realm value (case-sensitive), in
combination with the canonical root URL (the absolute URL for the server
whose abs_path is empty; see section 5.1.2 of [2]) of the server being
accessed, defines the protection space.  These realms allow the protected
resources on a server to be partitioned into a set of protection spaces,
each with its own authentication scheme and/or authorization database.
The realm value is a string, generally assigned by the origin server,
which may have additional semantics specific to the authentication scheme.
Note that there may be multiple challenges with the same auth-scheme but
different realms.

The protection space determines the domain over which credentials can
be automatically applied. If a prior request has been authorized, the
same credentials MAY be reused for all other requests within that
protection space for a period of time determined by the authentication
scheme, parameters, and/or user preference. Unless otherwise defined by
the authentication scheme, a single protection space cannot extend outside
the scope of its server.

So you see Microsoft’s IIS/4.0 is not so RFC compliant.

The US phone network is split into different areas that are controled by
RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Comapnies). For example, if you live in Texas,
your RBOC will be SouthWestern Bell. These LECs (Local Excahnge Carriers) and
IXCs (Inter eXchange Carriers divide America into different call handeling
sections. Here is a list of all of the RBOCs for different areas:

Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs)


     NYNEX -                Covering New York and New England,

     Bell Atlantic -        Covering the Mid Atlantic states,

     Bell South -           Operating in the South Eastern states,

     Ameritech -            Covering the Midwest,

     U.S. West -            Covers the mountain states and northwest,

     Pacific Telesis -      Operating in California and Nevada, and

     Southwestern Bell -    Covers Texas and southern states west of the
                            Mississippi.


The Regional Bell Companies were set up as part of the Modified Final
Judgment implemented in January 1984. Recent legislation has significantly
altered how these regional bell companies can do business and what
communications services they provide. As a result, some companies like Bell
Atlantic, Ameritech, Pacific Telesis, Bell South and NYNEX have been
aggressive in pursuing new business areas. They are now able to more freely
compete than ever before. This means what we identify here today is likely
to be changed tomorrow. For example, a merger between Bell Atlantic Mobile
and NYNEX Mobile was completed on July 1, 1995 and resulted in the formation
of a new company, Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile.

RBOCs and Area of Coverage
RBOC -- Original Local Exchange Carriers

Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs)
----------------------------------------

Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs) were established after divestiture
to permit telephone companies to charge subscribers for access to local or
regional exchanges and to the interexchange toll telephone network for
sending and receiving intra-LATA and interstate calls.

Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs) are geographic areas generally
smaller than a state that follow telephone boundaries (not state
boundaries).  They identify define areas within which the telephone
companies offer exchange and exchange access services (local calling,
private lines, etc.) to subscribers.

Local Exchange Carriers (LECs)
------------------------------

Telephone subscribers are provided basic telephone network access by
physical connection from customer premises to a local central office. This
connection is a dialed up connection or a dedicated trunk connection, like
a leased T1 (1.544 Mbps) channel.

For dial-up connections, after the phone is dialed, the subscriber accesses
a variety of telephone services and call handling features provided by
the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC). These telephone services and functions
were for connections in the LEC's Local Access and Transport Area. For
dedicated trunk lines the local segment set up and maintained by LECs at
each end, while the inter-LATA portion of the circuit is established and
maintained by an Inter-eXchange Carrier (IXC). LECs were set up as part of
the 1984 Divestiture decision. However, the separate company designations
are fading today. Recently, Bell Atlantic renamed its LECs to just Bell
Atlantic.

The Inter-eXchange Carriers (IXCs)
----------------------------------

Calls to locations outside the LATA require the LEC to pass the call to a
designated Inter-eXchange Carrier's (IXC) point of presence (POP). The IXC
transports the call to a LEC at the destination LATA. Basically Inter-
eXchange Carriers transport calls from LATA to LATA.

Since the breakup of AT&T in 1984, Inter-eXchange Carriers have been
required to interface with local telephone companies via points of
presence. These are serving offices set up in each LATA. The POP is the
point to which the local telephone company connects its customers for long
distance dial-up and leased-line communications between LATAs.

Inter-eXchange Carriers are AT&T, MCI, Sprint, and others.

Telephone Network Segments
Competitive Access Providers (CAPs)and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers
(CLECs)
-------

Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) provide fiber optic and microwave
communications links that connect to Inter-eXchange Carriers (IXCs). These
links compete with Local Exchange Carriers' (LECs') networks in the top 25
metropolitan areas nationwide as well as in many smaller metropolitan areas.
Many metropolitan networks were formed during cable television's years of
prosperity. Now CAPs compete with CATV service providers. Recent FCC rulings
help CAPs quickly become viable competitors to LECs. If a CAP is providing
local dial tone then it is often labeled a Competitive Local Exchange
Carrier (CLEC).

Metropolitan networks first appeared with the spread of cable television.
Although, these networks were limited television signal distribution from
satellite downlinks to residential communities, the early cable systems
became the prototypes of Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). In the early
1980s satellite uplink operators built teleports and local access networks
to offer direct private satellite transmission services to large
organizations. While 1984 breakup of AT&T increased competition in the long
distance and communications markets, it left the local connectivity market
monopoly essentially intact. However, entrepreneurs began to offer long
distance service using teleport satellite circuits combined with private
local access networks to their customers premises. Cable television
companies also deployed fiber for high-traffic routes and explored using
fiber for connections to subscriber premises. The spread of such
metropolitan local access networks eroded the LEC monopoly over local loop
connectivity to subscribers. Further, CAPs demanded access to LECs'
operations centers and central offices (COs). CAPs exerted extensive
pressure on the FCC to achieve these goals. LECs strongly resisted this
encroachment on their business base.  Today LECs are forced to allow CAPs
to co-locate with their physical facilities. This is expanding to allow
CAPs to directly connect with LEC central offices in some areas providing
alternative access to the LECs' local switch.

Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) have more than 27 individual networks
supporting users with heavy data traffic. These CAP networks offer customers
up to 100 Mbps transmission speed and redundant routing for point-to-point
transmission at lower prices. Further, CAPs generally have more fiber optic
transmission experience and deliver higher quality transmission facilities
and circuits than do the LECs.

Other Common Carriers
---------------------

Other Common Carriers (OCC) are Specialized Common Carriers (SCCs) offering
unique communications services, domestic and international record carriers
supporting international communications, and domestic satellite carriers
providing satellite communications services authorized by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC).

MCI, Sprint, and other carriers are sometimes referred to as Other
CommonCarriers.

Services Piggybacked on Private Networks
----------------------------------------

A private network is a network built and operated by a private organization
or corporation for their specific benefit. Often the private network
facilities have excess capacity. The private network organization in an
effort to reduce its costs permits other organizations to use the excess
capacity of private network facilities. Special multiplexers typically
connect one or more voice, data, fax, or video channels to shared common
channels leading to the private network backbone. This multiplexer equipment
differs in price, support, and features offered. A feature is voice
compression technique which determines the number simultaneous voice calls
supported and the voice quality of each call. In selecting such multiplexers
look beyond claims of impressively high capacity for simultaneous voice
calls.

Telephone Network with Competitive Access Providers
---------------------------------------------------
Common Carrier Services

Common carriers are organizations providing regulated telephone, telegraph,
telex, and data communications services.

Voice Grade Channels and Circuits

Voice grade channels and circuits are designed to carry voice frequencies
in the audio frequency speech transmission range of 300 to 3,400 Hz. Voice
grade channels provide a bandwidth of about 3 KHz. This effectively limits
the amount of information they can carry. Voice grade channels can be
dial-up lines or leased lines. Dial-up lines use two wires (a single pass
windows) while leased lines are four (4) wire service. A leased line is
sometimes referred to as a private line or a dedicated line.

The 500, 700, 800, and 900 Number Services
------------------------------------------

There are several services available to businesses beyond basic dial-up
services. The services described here 700, 800, and 900 services have been
used differently by businesses during their relatively short lifetimes.
Basically these services use voice grade channels but bill for them at
special rates.

500 and 700 Services

A single number telephone service for mobile individuals is provided using
the 500 and 700 numbers. Telephone service providers offer nationwide
"follow-me" phone numbers for mobile customers. The service uses both the 700
and a newly activated 500 access code. Unlike geographic area codes such as
415, 213 or 916, the 500 and 700 codes cover the entire country like the 800
and 888 area codes. A 500 or 700 number service lets customers be reached at
any location and on any equipment. Instead of different numbers for business,
cellular, fax and home phones, now one number can be called to reach you on
any type phone, anywhere in the country. The 10-digit 500 and 700 service
numbers (500-XXX-XXXX, 700-XXX-XXXX) represent an individual customer.

800 Service

The 800 services are among the most famous carrier service. The 800 service
and WATS services were introduced by AT&T in the '60s. WATS charges bulk
rates for directly dialed station-to-station calls over the public switched
telephone network. WATS provides switched, voice-grade channels for
transmission of either voice or data. The 800 service provided today is a
toll-free, inbound service for callers dialing an 800 number. Today because
of the high use of 800 numbers, AT&T advertises both 888 and 800 numbers for
800 number services. An 800 number may be local, regional, national, or
international in coverage and it can be assigned to any local access phone
line.

900 Service pr0n

The 900 service charges the callers not the number being called. Today's 900
service applications make revenue. Callers dial a 900 number and select
information that is sent immediately to their fax. TV surveys are routinely
performed via 900 services. Technical support lines for PC products use 900
services rather than toll-free or local exchange numbers combined with credit
card accounts.

Dial-Up Telephone Services
--------------------------
North American Numbering Plan (NANP)

The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) was originally designed by AT&T back
in 1947. It is the system for assigning area codes, telephone numbers, and
other important network codes throughout the U.S. and 17 other countries. The
system covers the World Zone 1 calling area including the United States,
Canada, Bermuda, and most of the Caribbean.

After divestiture in 1984, Bellcore (Bell Communications Research) took over
NANP administration, and not so surprisingly controversy over a conflict of
interest began. The argument is that basically Bellcore, owned by the
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), favors both the RBOCs and AT&T
with special numbering assignments. This controversy heightened with the
exhaustion of area codes. All area codes were designated as having a 0 or a 1
as their middle number. Today because of the proliferation of cellular phones
and additional home phone lines for fax and data communications, several
metropolitan areas have had to use additional area codes. Washington, D.C.
now has 703, 301 and the newer 410 area codes. As a result the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) intervened in October of 1992. The
involvement of the FCC caused Bellcore to withdraw as administrator of the
NANP in August of 1993. Bellcore agreed to remain on as plan administrator
for 12 to 18 months permitting the FCC to select a new administrator. Today
Bellcore is still the administrator of the NANP.

Area Code Exhaustion
--------------------

The phenomenal growth of telecommunications over the last 20 years is reason
for the current area code shortage. High growth areas include:

     1.) Cellular phones,
     2.) Fax machines,
     3.) Portable beepers,
     4.) Multiple number services,
     5.) Direct Inward Dialing DID numbers,
     6.) Pay-per-view applications, and
     7.) Special ringing features.

These and many other applications consume large blocks of seven-digit
numbers. Consequently, there are not enough seven-digit numbers to keep up
with the demand.

Current NAPA Numbering
----------------------

NAPA geographic area codes are three-digit numbers formatted N(0 or1)X with N
any digit 2 through 9, then either 0 or 1, and X any digit 0 through 9. The
area code is followed by a seven-digit subscriber number. The subscriber
number previously a NNX-XXXX format is now a NXX-XXXX allowing the use of 0
or 1 as the second digit. The N(0 or 1)X format has a maximum of 8 2 10 or
160 combinations. As the demand for area codes in North America grew,
Bellcore proposed an integrated numbering plan for World Zone 1, essentially
North American and the Caribbean. The new plan went into effect in January
1995 and changed the numbering system from an N(0 or 1)X-NXX-XXXX format to
an NXX-NXX-XXXX format. This change increased the quantity of available ten
digit phone numbers from about 1 billion to 6 billion.

! Rolling Deep !                                                          tgb
~!@#~!@#~!@#~!@#

With all the dangers and precarious situations the modern hax0r can find
himself in on the streets, the ninties have brought forth the need to "roll
deep." The whole rationale behind the concept of rolling deep lies in the age
old adage. "Strength in numbers," or something along those lines, although
rolling deep by no means requires a large group or backup posse. The term
rolling deep stems directly from the world of hardcore hip hop and gangsta
rap, and is often used in conjunction with phrases like, "Ya best proteck ya
neck," "bakdafukup," or other equally street-smart phrases that manage to
incorporate both defensivness and threat. In any case, the implications are
easily identifiable and the prmoise of quick retaliation looms in the fore-
ground; rolling deep is a means of letting people know that you are not to
be fucked with. The perils of being caught slippin' in this day and age are
just too great. I know the value of rolling deep and have integrated it into
my daily routine, rolling deep for such mundane tasks as getting a late-
night snack from the fridge, buying a new sweater, or making a important
phone call home. Hopefully some of the following tips, examples, and
observations will acquaint you with the ways of rolling deep as fuck,
'cause it's too dangerous to be caught shallow.

1. Put on the hardest clothes you can find (consult the latest number one
video on Rap City) and practice scowling in the mirror for a few hours. The
scowl is on the most integral aspects of rolling deep and must be perfected,
although allowances can be made for the Flava-Flav type joker in every
group. Take a deep breath and tell yourself you are hard until you believe
it.

2. Pretend you are in a rap video, running down the street in slow motion or
backing up the MC. Visualize yourself as an actual member of a video posse.

3. Practice the "What the fuck?!" arm gesture (both arms open, palms spread
outward) until it becomes an automatic response to any question, especially
if from a parent, cop, boss, or teacher.

4. Grow some sort of "hard" facial hair.

5. Wear a very unhip pair of sunglasses--not bullshit Oakley or Arnet, but
something like cop glasses or oversized mom-style glaasses. Basically
anything you can snag out of a lost-and-found-bin will do.

6. Look around a lot, like you expecting static from any direction.

7. Cultivate a fake limp or strut and walk extremely slowly.

8. Refer to people only as "bitches" or "fools." Learn to integrate the
following words or phrases into your everyday speech, regardless of their
meaning in your life: gat, nine, blast in the face, bitchslap, gangstalean,
etc.

You are now ready to assemble the crew and synchronize the eight-step
rolling deep program. Usually a larger group will signify a deeper roll,
but this is not always the case. Certain people will never attain the
ability to roll deep, no matter how much backup they have. Conversely, some
motherfuckers roll deep when hanging out on solo tip. Some of the deepest
rollers are the strong, silent types who can handles themselves in any
situation. Consider the following list of some people who roll deep and some
who don't quite make it.

Deep As Fuck:

Wu-Tang, the Warriors (from that old '70s movie), this dude I once saw
lounging in a designer sweatsuit and shades, Slayer.

Wading Pool:

Hammer, New Kids On The Block, Blackstreet, any fast food employee or
manager, rock star snowboarders, bitch-ass rollerbladers.

Of course those you new to the ways of rolling deep should never try to bust
a flex on someone with experience. First things first, you should go in
gradually, the way one would enter a pool of freezing water. You should
initially roll deep only on inanimate objects such as street signs, a
jammed or locked door, or a soda machine that shorted your coin. From that
point you should work your way up to blind people or alley cats, but only
when you feel comfortable. Progression will naturally lead you to flexin'
on old ladies and infants. Get confident, live your lyrics, and work your
way up to speed. Eventually you'll be able to walk the streets with pride
and conviction that can only come with the knowledge that your are rolling
deep.                                                                   --tgb

                                Intro

As I have not been skating for a very long time, I cannot understand
everything, but however I do realize a generation of youth have passed up
some of the coolest old tricks. Instead of doing nose slides, tail slides,
or railslides, they insist on just doing kick flips, heel flips and minor
grinds. "Bring back the old school style!" a friend once said to me. And
so I shall.


Handrails. Fun for the whole family. Dangerous indeed, but yet nothing is
more thrilling than the feeling of eliteness when you can conquere the
rail. It's hard, I'll give you that, and it's a painful proccess, i know
this from personal experience. But don't doubt yourself. Just sum up what
courage you have, and go for it.


                        First Things First

Some prerequisites of handrail boardsliding is:

1. You must be crazy.
2. You must have mad courage.
3. Be sensible.
4. Ollie must be at least *half* of the rails heigth.
5. Requirement 4 only counts if your doing boardslides on the handrail.
6. Feel the force.


When trying for the handrail, for the first time, I recommend that you try
it on a handrail thats only about 4-6 feet long. Those eight footers
aren't the same, even if they are the same heigth. Because its only 4 feet
long you can perfect your technique before trying it on an 8-16 foot rail.
Also you won't be able to come off as easy on a short rail but its good
practice, take my word for it.

* NOTE * If your one of those kids who builds there own skate parks in
         their back yards, a good 6 foot rail will do nicely. build it at
         a slight incline so you can get a feel for what its like in real
         life. (sorry im a street skater. i have no preference for home
         built stuff and vert style. well that and i'm poor.)

Ollie high, and use your jedi skate skills to propel you. Look below.

       ________
       -------.`\
               `\`\  <--- Unless your ollies are super high, this is
       -------.  `\`\     probably the point you want to hit.
              |__  `\`\
                 |   :`|
                     | |

Hitting it from an angle is key. Don't try and hit the very top of the
rail because many people try and they also get concussions. (ouch).

By ollieing at an angle from the end of the step to the curb, your ollie
heigth stays the same, while the rail heigth slowly declines giving you
the oppurtunity to railslide it.


                        Now We're Having Fun

As you've made it on to the rail, you scream "what do i do now??" Well All
you have to do, is this:

1. Make sure both feet are on the mounting hardware.
2. Push your weight forward.
3. Adjust yourself to where you won't get hurt.
4. Don't try anything outrageously stupid.

Example below.

  (handrail view 1. Looking up at it)

               back of rail

                   | |
            .--0---| |---0--.   As you ollie onto it, your board must
            |  |   | |   |  |   be leveled out like so.
            `--0---| |---0--'
                   | |          Keep your feet straight and your weight
                   | |          frontwards.
                   | |

               end of rail


                                End of the Line

So you want to come off? By now you should have either fallen off or
landed on your skull. But there is an easier way!

1. As you start to come up to the end of the rail you'll need to be ready
   seeing as you only have less than a second to come off.
2. Don't try ollie'ing off the rail because unless your doing a grind,
   you're going to destroy those genitals you cherish so much.
3. As you come off, shift all the weight the way you want to come off
   (frontside or backside).
4. When your off shift your weight towards the front a little to adjust to
   the speed change.

Diagrams listed below.

               | |


      \ \     .-.             as you get closer to the end, get ready to shift
       `\`\ /`  /             off quick, you won't have much time so a perfect
         `\`\ /'              surgical maneuver is needed.

       `../` : :

           `\`\\ `\           shift off quickly, and land your board putting
             : :`\ `\         your weight slightly forward to ease the velocity
             | |  `-'         of your landing.

Once you have landed, most people will reguard you as "fucking crazy" but hey
*you* are the one who can do handrails. *You* have the balls and know how to do
this somewhat elite technique which has surpassed a generation of skaters who
reguard skaters who do this crazy. Show them whats what.


Finish

Well I hope I'll write more articles on this, because I love to skate.
It's what I do when I'm bored. It's better than school and your board
doesn't complain like a woman either. Try this. Be brave. Find where you
lie at most in *your* style of skating. Be free.

(special thanks to Thoai Tran for bringing out the beauty of skating in us
all. Thank you.)

        This  text  is  an introduction to the smartlink(tm)
3175   automatic  protection  switching  system  by  westell
technologies.


Introduction:
        SmartLink(tm)! The Westell 3175 Automatic Protection
switching  system(APSS),  also  know  as SmartLink(tm), is a
fully automatic protection switching system for up to 20 DS1
circuits  per  shelf.  If  any  one  of  the circuits become
defective,   the   system   will  automatically  switch  the
defective  customer's  T1/DS1  (hi-Cap) circuit to something
called  a  "hot spare"  protected circuit (T1/DS1-Hi-Cap) to
provide  the  gimp uninterrupted service.  The SmartLink(tm)
system  is  designed for use with traditional repeatered T1,
HDSL, fiber circuits, and digital radio applications.

The Local Loop:
        The local loop is missing two things the rest of the
Network  has  which  are:  1) Redundancy, and 2) NMA Access.
Which  looks  something like this... (dont flame my pic.)...

Overview.
        In this text we'll discuss the vulnerabilities in the Virgin Baptist
Female System, (VBFM for short). After spending 2 years within a Baptist
Compound (they call it college) with plenty of console access to VBFM's, I've
gained the experience and learned the many exploits possible in the VBMF.

Gaining Access.
        The easier of the tasks, gaining entry to the VBFM can be obtained
within a week or less with the proper patience and tools. The typical VBFM
has an invisible defense mechanism installed (A "Snob" Firewall" if you will)
by their Mother/Father units. This defense isn't at all unsimiliar to the
Death Star's force field, except rather than holding back the rebellion, it
holds back common net trash like yourself. It used to be believed
wanna_be_pimp.c would exploit this wall, but with the newer VBFM's you'll
need charm.c, narcotics.c and alkyhol.c. charm.c can be run remotely (say
from accross the lunchroom) but you'll need a trusted connection before you
can use the latter 2. 99% of the time, because of the naivety of the VBFM,
one of these 3, or a combination will get you console to the VBFM. (if not
j0o need skillz lewser)

Interior Sekurity.

      Once you've taken down the "Snob" Firewall" and obtained console, you
will need to get your way into /usr/panties. Generally narcotics.c and
alkyhol.c have worn the system down enough to gain access to this dir, but
with some of the heavily guarded system's peempTekneeks.c will be needed do
the trick. Now that you've gotten into /usr/panties, the system is yours to
abuse. Remember, be generous and let your friends use the backdoor in the
system.

Dont forget to clean up. export HIST_FILE > /dev/null (hide JIZZ_REMAINS on
/virgins/chin).  No you fucking moron, I'm not serious, it's 2 am, I'm
drinking and doing tabs, the only thing dumber than me writing this is you
spending the time reading it. - pr0phet

A few ideas to implement means to disway spoofing of most types.

DISCLAIMER:  Hi, I thought most of this up during cigarette breaks or that
brief 30 minute come down from smoking grass.  These ideas are my own as far
as I know, but if I infringed on anyone else's intellectual property please
let me know.  I am more than happy to admit that I am not the first person
to come up with ideas as such.  The ideas shown here are all vaporware as of
right now.  Jorge and tip have been reaming me up the ass for articles, so I
wrote one.  Don't have time to code, ain't all that great a coder anywayz
(will remedy).  But hey, if anyone wants to code them, lemme know and I'll
see how I can help.  Of course I won't mind my name on your warez, but hey,
I'm doing this for karma's sake anyway.

Spoofing is the broad term given to the act of disguising one self on a
network.  Most types of spoofing are well known, ip-spoofing or blind
spoofing, reverse and forward dns spoofing, and of course MAC address
spoofing are among the most common.  This paper is not about how to implement
these means of forging oneself to aid in acts of system penetration.  Rather,
it is a discussion pertaining to diswaying the acts of spoofing, so as a
system administrator one would be allowed to sleep soundly at night.

A brief description on the problem(s) at hand.

Ip-spoofing stems from the problem that a person given sufficient priviledges
on any box can create a raw packet, and fill in the specific headers of at
his/her discretion.  The packet will be forwarded from hop to hop towards its
final destination and do whatever the author of the packet wants it to do,
limited only by the services used on the target box.

What can one do with ip-spoofing:

One of the most common usages of ip-spoofing is Denial of Serivce attacks.
Although trivial to construct raw ip packets, there remains little one can
do if one is surmounted with this attack.  A report to cert and one's service
provider (more than likely they will be the ones calling you), then getting
the juristication to read router logs hop by hop to decipher where the packet
is coming from, is simply unacceptably inefficient and time consuming.

(yeah yeah write a fucking perl script right?  When this attack spans
several ASs, you write the fucking perl script and decipher all these logs
bitch).

Aside from DoS attempts, ip-spoofing can be used for a number of other
attacks.  Reverse DNS spoofing mandates that one forges a packet that is
entered into the victim's dns server's cache.  This allows then for attacks
such as rsh/rcp and etc compromises.  (Some sysadmins still use .rhost.  Why?
I dunno.  Maybe they believe in their firewalls, which does not defrag
packets before analyzing packets and forwarding them.  Who knows >:) ).
Another example is tcp hijacking.  There are many papers into this topic, so
I will not divulge another 20 odd pages explaining how it works.  The idea,
however, remains constant.  Most IP routing schemes have no authentication
mechanism implemented widely that checks the authenticity of a packet before
forwarding it.  IP is not sessioned, hence it cannot check the true source
of the packet either.  Relying on higher layers of the protocol however can
remedy this to a certain degree.

How does one then stop an ip spoofing attack from ever materializing?

Curing the problem from the source (where it should be anywayz):

Before a box forwards a packet, ie in the state of a gateway, there should
be some mechanism that allows a check for the integrity of the packet itself.
If one is running a gateway on a lan, a simple check on a packet filter will
suffice.  It is neither of great cost nor consequence to implement.  If the
gateway is a linux/*bsd box, a simple ipchains/ipfw rule appended to the
forward section will suffice.  If the gateway is not a box that allows this
configuration, an additional box placed in between the gateway and its next
router will also suffice.  The only ramification to that is the increase on
hop count, which if one has to use rip.  RIP has a limit of 15 hops, and
will run into problems if one's lan is over 15 hops from any point A to
point B.  (if it gets that big, you shouldn't be running rip anyway)  This
means stops just about any form of ip spoofing, if the gateway is secure.

Curing the problem from the victim's end.

If the problem is stemming from one's own AS, using the TTL field in the ip
packet is a reliable means to check for the validity of the packet.  If one
has GOT to use rsh and etc services, a daemon that incorporates the functions
of tcpd should also check the number of hops a packet has travelled.  (If you
are about to rag on me about dynamic ip routing, stfu.  I'll get to that in
a minute.)  Simply put, if one controls an AS, one is entitled to the entire
network layout of that AS.  One should realise that there is a FINITE amount
of permutations of which a packet can go through before reaching its
destinations.  In other words, one can map the TTL value with a different
number of allowed values.  The chances of the attacker getting past that is
slim, unless he knows the allowed hop count already.

As a protection mechanism that only protects a certain PORT on ONE box,
there is no reason one should ever allow other people to see these boxes in
the first place.  Packet filtering should be used for that, as this is a
means to foil the spoofer only after the packet filter has failed to do it's
bidding.  (ie, if someone scans you, rsh etc ports should not show up on
their logs.  If they don't know it's there, generally they aren't gonna
bother with this means of attack).

Foiling this means of protection, however, is generally quite simple.  A
traceroute with loose source routing turned on with the soon-to-be spoofed
address will tell the attacker the number of hops from spoofed address to
victim.  Hence, this is not a sure fire way of foiling a spoofer, since it
can be foiled quite easily.

Using this means to foil reverse dns spoofing however, is even harder.  With
the volatile nature of the internet, routers go down on a per minute basis.
Hence, inter-AS and intra-AS hop count changes dramatically, and as a system
administrator on a little class C there is very little information for
him/her to authenticate reverse dns replies.  Using a static value for the
above measure simply will not fly.  Using a dynamic authentication however,
will.  By pinging the supposed dns server when it replies to a reverse
request from the victim's dns server, one will get a sufficiently new value
to authenticate.  If the real dns server does not reply to pings, simply
refuse to add the entries to the dns cache.  It is sufficient to presume
that the spoofed dns server is under a denial of service attack.

Foiling MAC address spoofing.

MAC addy spoofing is harder than ip spoofing, since it needs a network card
driver that allows one to change the mac address of the network card.  Linux
polls the MAC address from the ethernet card when initalized.  Once it is
polled it is stored in a kernel buffer, which does not normally allow
changing unless one rolls his own lkm for the network card.  It is however
possible to write to the eeprom of the network card and change the MAC
address there.  The sequence of events should follow suit as such:

a) root box.
b) write to crontab to do the following.
1) ifconfig eth1 down
2) rmmod ethernetmodule
3) write to the ethernet card eeprom address using raw memory polling from
   the bus.  You're root, so you can pull this off.  Change kernel source if
   needed, but you can do it.  Whatever you can make a dos box do, you can
   do it with linux by weakening the kernel source and compiling a new one.
   Just add the lilo and reboot sequence somewhere in your crontab.
4) insmod ethernetmodule
5) ifconfig eth1 newipofspoofedbox

If the perpetrator is planning to attack a router, on the same subnet as the
controlling terminal (why sysadmins do not have a permanent connection to
the serial port of the router remains a mystery, but the fact is, relying
on packet integrity is foolish) will get him/her around the MAC address
authentication procedures.  Once that step is done, one can essentially
update/change/flush router tables, such as bgp.  If this is on the same
subnet, using any part of the packet to authenticate is impossible.  One
cannot ask the "real" box if it sent this packet either, because tcp/ip has
features that will not allow a connection to initiate if there is not a
socket bound to a port on the destination machine.  Since the spoofed box
has the same mac address as the real box, one will never be able to
establish any form of connection, much less poll information.  (This is of
course if everything on that subnet is running on the same piece of wire.)

Now how would one get around that?  No one said anything about not talking
in non-tcp/ip protocols to query the real box :)  Ipx/appletalk both run on
ethernet, and can be used to query sniffer logs on the real box and see if
it sent that packet.  Since the other boxes do not support these network
protocols, it will simply not respond.  Once the box that had it's mac
address spoofed realises that it's subnet has been attacked, it can then
shut down the compromised box.  The steps follow:

1) write to the firewall rules to deny all tcp packets to ssh/rsh/rlogin
2) turn on a sniffer to catch sequence numbers
3) send mail to admin, shut down compromised box using ssh/rsh/rlogin.
4) resume full service
5) turn off all remote administration capabilites for the evening on all
   boxes on it's subnet for the evening.

The admin of course will have great fun peering over the logs of the
attacked box, realizing the point of attack because the attacker has had
no warning of a shutdown.  Hence all his activity is readily intact for
next morning.

In conclusion, TCP/IPv4 has no means of authentication at the 3/4 layer.
Most of this has to be done on the application layer where it is much more
difficult, and a heck of a lot slower.  However, there are ways around this
problem.  All suggestions welcomed.

Introduction
------------

This is a very compact file, designed to be an intorduction, or primer to
5ESS local compact digital exchange units. I am wrtting this off the top of
my head, so don't expect it to be very complex in technical nature. For
starters I'll explain a little about the new 5ESS switches and there
functions. We've all heard of the millenium bug, and it's supposid ability to
take out massive networks etc. Well Lucent technologys, Bellcore (now
telecord communications or somthing), aswell as lata exchange carrier
providers such as MCI, AT&T, Sprint, and all the RBOC's such as SWBell, etc,
all got a bit paranoid and decided to enhance to current 5ESS switching
configurations to a new architecture they feel would be compatable with the
millenium software and network problems. The new 5ESS-2OOO switches are all
basically the same as conventional 5ESS switches, except the software parts,
such as the administration control software platforms, and global title
translation software etc, have been upgraded to be Y2K compatable. As well
as this, the new 5ESS switches have been modified (based upon conventional
5ESS) to be easily upgraded in the future with new modules for future
telecommunications developments. In other words, the new digital switches are
very very very souped-up versions of 5ESS, infact, I would concider them to
be one of the most versatile switches around. Now the deal with these new
digital switching systems is that they can handle more and more lines, more
network traffic, aswell as a very upgraded ability for general system
capacity. They have also been upgraded with new security features to stop
people like me from gaining access to the local administration part which
is accessable via x25, the PSTN, and the net (on a 'secret' IP range).. I'm
not going to go into that at the moment, thats another file.. Anyways, as I
was saying, the new 5ESS-2OOO digital exchanges are like souped up 5ESS
switches. Before there where people bitching about how they can get 'traced'
messing around on the phone network because 5ESS logs shit. Well, I got news
for you, 99.9% of all worldwide switching mechanisms, electro-mechanical, or
digital derived, ALL log stuff, and always have done. It's just with these
new 5ESS-2OOO digital exchanges, its more obvious if you are messing around.
Lets say for example you where scanning over 400 numbers a night via your
land line.. Normaly a 5ESS, DMS, TXE etc would just log your line usuage,
calling patterns etc into a subscriber log in one of the switches sub-system
parts. You would only usually get discovered if one of the field technitions,
glanced at the data for you line usuage. Thats ok, because we all no that
exchange field operators are lame and lazy, but what about this new 5ESS-
2OOO line loging equipment? - welp, I have bad news for you. If you scan
in continuous, or repetitive cycles over your subscriber loop, the chances
are, you're gonna get your haxoring ass taken to court by your RBOC, or
whatever provider you are with. The reason for this is that 5ESS-2OOO
digital switches continously monitor the activity, and network usuage of over
100,000 lines similtaniously. Instead of loging line status etc into a
dormant log file in a sub-system, if one of the local switches notices that
somthings up, a field adminstrator is notified imediatly, probably by the
means of a status bar on an uplinked terminal. The new switches have been
modified to be very stringent on system capacity and usuage patterns, and
will notify any field office engineer of the slightest problem. The new 5ESS-
2OOO switches are basically like UK monologs, in other words, they record
everything about your line, all digits dialed, even after terminating
destination point, they even log the time intervals between each tone you
dial/emit. Basically they are the big-bro of the phone system so start
getting paranoid. (I know for a fact, that it is possible to log onto one of
the local exchange units and turn line logging OFF, and even make your line
appear to be non-existant). Anhow, I think I've probably made a few people a
little paranoid now, on with the rest of the file.

Types of local compact digital exchanges
----------------------------------------

Werd, well now its time for the focus of the file. I'm not writting a mad
big file on the entire 5ESS-2OOO network because it would take _ages_, so
I'm going to focus on local compact excahnges designed for the rurual
community such as college campuses and areas with not many subscribers, like
suberban areas of towns. There are 2 main types of compact 5ESS-2OOO local
switch, the CDX (Compact Digital eXchange), and the VCDX (Very Compact
Digital eXchange). Both these new units are designed to be very echonimacal
for the money raking telcos. The idea is that these switches are being placed
in new suberban housing developments, and are being integrated into the PSTN
as we speak. The CDX digital exchange for example is designed to be very
snall, handeling small local phone networks, it can however be upgraed with
the implementation of modules, kind of like plug'n'play, until the switch
becomes a fully fledged 5ESS-2OOO unit if required in the future. Lets take
a look at these local networks in more detail.

The CDX digital exchange
------------------------

The CDX (Compact Digital eXchange) is a small sized siwtch configuration,
which is capable of providing the same services to subscribers the same as
a conventional 5ESS switch would. Unlike the older rural exchange units,
these new switches are capable of handeling more advanced telecommunications
services like wideband data transmission, and video data etc. The switch is
housed in a cabinet that is 6 foot high, 29.9 inches wide, and 23.6 inches
deep. The switch is desinged to be a stand alone unit and as I said before,
very capable of handeling current/future telecommunications developments and
serverices such as POTS lines (Plain Old Telephone Service), equal access
services, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), CENTREX services such
as call waiting, hold, etc etc. The system is also designed to be fully
compatable with the Signaling System 7 telephony protocol which has been
implemented over the majourity of the international PSTN. The switch can
handle from 100 subscriber loops, upto 15,000 local access lines or 15,000
remote access lines. CDX operates on the same software as the conventional
5ESS-2OOO switch, and also has the same call routing architecture (physical).

The VCDX digital exchange
-------------------------

VCDX stands for (VERY Compact Digital eXchange), and when I say compact, I
mean compact. It is the smallest of all 5ESS-2OOO switch configurations but
is still very capable of providing the same services as its bigger bro, the
CDX switch. This switch is used by CATV, CAPS, small towns, and government
facilitys. The switch is also capable of providing Central Office services
such as the usual call waiting, and ISDN. The intersting thing about this
switch is that it supports Carrier Identification Code (CIC) expansion and
is compatable with changing NPA's in the Interchangable Numbering Plan Area,
as required by reglatory bodys such as the FCC.

The VCDX switch can support various configurations using a single 5ESS
Switching Module (SM) to handle the call processing. The SM is controlled by
a sophisticated UNIX software-based workstation which provides administrative
and maintenance capabilities. A mimimum configuration of 2 cabinets that are
6 foot high x 29.9 inches wide x 23.6 inches deep in size is necessary and
thus it fits in a small space. If left in standard mode, the VCDX can handle
upto 1,500 lines. If the SM-2OOO unit is impemented as a module, the switch
can handle as many as 14,000 lines.

        This article is going to attempt to explain the methods necessary
to control and to read from specific pins on a PC parallel port. It is
assumed that the reader has knowledge of the linux operating system, the C
programming language, and basic electronic concepts.
        The advantages to being able to control and read external devices
via a relatively simple device such as the parallel port are numerous. Any
circuit that needs a fairly complex control interface, without the
overhead of custom hardware such as an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate
Array), stands to benefit from such an arrangement. For instance,
oscillation can easily be controlled by the output pin of a parallel port
connected to the base lead of a switching transistor. To generate this in
a stand-alone environment, without the help of a computer, a capacitor and
resistor as well as a driving IC like the 555 timer would be needed.
        Other than hardware development, practical applications for the
security-minded person are very numerous. A simple example would be
the connection of an external sensor, such as a reed switch, to a
computer. Software is also run to monitor the status of the reed
switch. If it becomes triggered, (i.e. if a door is opened), than the
program monitoring can take certain action, such as encryption of critical
files, or even the erasure of sensitive data. A conventional SPST switch
is also very plausible, mounted in a convenient place in case of
emergency.
        The PC parallel port consists of 25 pins, only 16 of which are
used in these examples. Bi-directional communication and unconventional
modes are not covered (SPP, EPP, etc.), as many older motherboards/BIOS's
do not support them.
        If one was to look at the end of the cable that hooked in to a
printer, the pins would be arranged in the following format...

        1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13
         14  15  16  17  18  19  25  24  23  22  21  20

        1:  Input 7 (NOT Strobe)          10:  Input 1 (Acknowledge)
        2:  Data 0                        11:  Input 0 (Not Busy)
        3:  Data 1                        12:  Input 2 (Paper End)
        4:  Data 2                        13:  Input 3 (Select)
        5:  Data 3                        14:  Input 6 (Auto Feed)
        6:  Data 4                        15:  Error
        7:  Data 5                        16:  Input 4 (NOT Init)
        8:  Data 6                        17:  Input 5 (Select Input)
        9:  Data 7                        18-25: Unused

        Note: Most printer cables will not use a DB25 connector,
        so an adapter or DB25 cable is needed.


        Pins 'Data 0' through 'Data 7' are used for output to the external
circuit. (They *can* be used for input, but this isn't recommended. :] )
The other pins, (Acknowledge, Select, etc.) are normally used for printer
feedback, but we will be using them for sending input from the external
circuit.
        There are some obstacles, however. First of all, the input pins
are all normally high. This needs be fixed in software with inversion, but
the problem also needs to be dealt with in hardware. For instance, even if
the programmer inverts the inputs, he still needs to consider the fact
that in reality the input pins are still all high. This means for the
circuit to set a pin to high, as visible to the software in question, the
pin needs to be grounded out. This is accomplished through the use of NPN
switching transistors with their emitter connected to their respective
input pin, and the collector connected to ground. The base of the
transistor becomes the new point of input, and we no longer need to worry
about the confusing inversion, as that no longer will be an issue to the
design of the external circuit.
        For our example circuit, we will simply add a SPST switch to the
base of one the input inversion transistors. If enough light shines on it,
the resistance is lowered to a point where the transistor reaches
breakdown voltage. When the occurs, current flows into the parallel port
grounding out the specific pin, which appears to the software as the pin
becoming 'high'.

       Input pin__
                  \        /
                NPN|-----/   --------- +5V
                  /      SPST
       Ground(-) -


        Note: Ground is not a specific pin on the DB25 connector...it is
        the metal surrounding the connector. If you are stripping the wire
        into a solderless breadboard, ground is the only wire uninsulated
        in the printer cable. Also, if you are connecting a 5 volt power
        supply for prototyping, remember to connect the power supply's
        ground (-) terminal to the parallel port ground.


        Obviously, the software is also easy to modify. A suggested
application would be setting up an SPST switch to automatically encrypt
anything sensitive on your hard drive, just in case you wake in the
morning with some feds in your room.
        If one was really daring, one could try to read data off
a Brinks alarm system master control panel. There are screw terminals
that are high or low depending on the status of the various zones in
the alarm system. The Brinks terminals are well labeled, and I myself have
written some basic software to monitor the various zones in my home.
However, it would be quite elite to perhaps construct such a monitor with
a JDK or GTK X interface, with a window showing the various zones of the
location being monitored. Incidentally, this software will probably be
released in b4b0-9 if someone else doesn't write it first.
        The source code included is only intended to demonstrate the
basics...complicated applications suggested are intended to be built on
the framework laid out in this article.
        The included code uses the ioperm(), outb(), and inb() functions
to read and set pins on the parallel port. The I/O is through the base
address of the port, which is usually 0x378 or 0x278, depending on whether
you use lpt1 or lpt2. Output pins are accessed through BASE, or simply
0x378. Input pins are accessed through BASE+1 and BASE+2, or 0x379 and
0x37a. It should be noted that BASE+1 denotes the first 5 pins of the
parallel port input, and BASE+2 denotes the last 3 pins. The I/O through
BASE is much simpler, because all 8 output pins are directly accessible.
There is also no inversion to deal with through output, while software
inversion is vital when dealing with input pins.
        I realize that this is a confusing topic, and questions are
welcome to be addressed to alecIB@hotmail.com. I'll try to answer them in
a more straightforward format if this article is too puzzling.
        Props to b4b0 for being so 'leet, smiler for 0wning me at coding,
rc for 0wning me at just about everything, and anyone else who 0wns me.

Windows NT Architecture Overview

        Window NT was designed to be modular operating system. Each part
independent of the other, by still working together to accomplish specific
system task.

        Windows NT uses objects which is a combination of data and
functions used to represent a service that can be shared by other
processes. These objects can be of different types, and attributes.

        The NT environment is divided up into two sections User mode, and
Kernel mode as shown in the appendix. User mode also called the nonprivileged
mode is where the user applications and environmental subsystems are
executed. To access system resources the user mode applications must make a
call to the executive services. User mode also houses some important sub
systems.

Environmental Subsystems
------------------------
NT has a limited ability to run applications for other operating systems.
such as OS/2, and POSIX.

        Win32 subsystem:
        ---------------
        Supports Windows NT/95/98 applications.


        Win 3.x subsystem:
        -----------------
        Supports the 16 bit windows system applications.


        DOS subsystem:
        -------------
        Supports DOS applications with the Virtual Dos Machine (VDM).


        POSIX subsystem:
        ---------------
        Supports POSIX.1 with limited functionality.


        OS/2 subsystems:
        ---------------
        Supports OS/2 but as with POSIX subsystem is limited.


Security Subsystem
------------------
This system handles the logon process and in conjunction with security
reference monitor (SRM), monitors, and verifies users on the system.


KERNEL MODE
-----------
Kernel Mode also called the privileged processor mode, has execution
priority over user mode processes. The kernel mode is mad up of there
parts know as Executive Services.


NT Executive
------------
All services that are part of NT Executive provide an interface between
the kernel and the environmental subsystems in user mode.

        Object Manager:
        --------------
        The Object Manager provides retention, naming, security, tracking
        allocating, and removing of objects.

        Security Reference Monitor:
        -------------------------
        The Security Reference Monitor as stated earlier in this article
        handles the logon process and security protected subsystem in
        users mode.

        Process Manager:
        _______________
        The Process Manager creates, and deletes processes also tracks
        process and thread objects.

        Local Procedure Call Facility:
        -----------------------------
        The Local Procedure Call Facility provides a relationship between
        applications and environmental subsystems.

        Virtual Memory Manager:
        ----------------------
        The Virtual Memory Manager maps virtual addresses to physical
        pages in memory and checks efficiency.

        I/O Manager:
        -----------
        The I/O Manager handles the input and output of the system upon
        request and determines which driver should be used and sends a
        request to it.

Kernel
------
The Kernel is the brains of operating system. The kernel is responsible
for scheduling all systems activities or threads for optimal performance.

Hardware Abstraction Layer:
--------------------------
The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is used to mask the differences
between the different types of hardware in the machine and make the
hardware more transparent to the operating system.

Article One: Ultimate B4B0

  Ultimate B4B0 is defined as the solution, rather forerunner, to the
pre-existing notion of each facet of everyday life.  Whereas the
mundane individual would cry out, "B4B0 is ultimate!"; the request is
left unanswered, powerless and angst-felt.  Words that people can live
by run throughout the outlets of culture, seemingly lost in the drechery
of the lost cause for liberation.  The cries of teenage girls, "Help me
B4B0, I need the power to overcome the lechery; to become at one with
the B4B0 Asthetic!" remain unanswered.

  Opponents of B4B0 foolishly avoid the issue of ultimacy, rather
trying to attack B4B0 with empty accusations.  "Sexual improperty,"
and "scandalous dervishness" rage throughout their voices.  B4B0
chooses to gesticulate the middle finger and pantomime masterbation,
speaking harshly, "Irreverency runs supreme in the idiot lots of the
likes as yours.  Rather than packaging the essence of ordinary life,
we live the asthetics that is defined as, 'Ultimate B4B0.' We shall
not be discounted."

  To understand "Ultimate B4B0," one must delve into the sinful sounds
only the the inner ear may hear.  The liberation from normalcy starts
with the proclamation of the destruction of overbearing drama that
weighs heavily upon the soul, dangling like brass tassles on the
swollen nipple.  How far are you willing to go?  Is the banality of
life transcendant upon the viscerals of day to day duties?  To better
understand the intent and asthetic of "Ultimate B4B0," one must study
the writings and philosophy of its membership.

  Ultimate B4B0 preaches the doctrine, "The substandard presence of
the ordinary, the supine, the meager portions of what makes up anything
substantial in the world today is nothing.  Our method is simple; it
is no more difficult than its epoch, yet empowering the essence of
the syntax and ideological implications of splendor and asthetics."
The asthetic of B4B0 lies within its brotherhood.

                         Death to liberals..

  In so-called "individuality," the youth of America are only following a
trend.  They are being led like CATTLES TO WATER.  No bit of thought placed
within their virtue.  Yes, here you have it.

The NEW YOUTH OF AMERICA:
1) Biologically speaking, less than 01% of the population SHOULD be homo-
   sexual, yet recent surveys show this rate has high as one in ten.
   The surpising high jump is in younger people.  With the fashionably
   'hip' gay 90's, a large portion of the youth of America are finding it
   to be 'cool' to declare homosexuality.  Some guy is taking it up the ass
   right now willingly, yet he isn't even gay.  Real smart youth.
2) The Manson youth of America wears make up and proclaims against the vir-
   tues bestowed upon them by their loving parents.  Of course, the claim
   "I'm doing this because I want to express my individuality" is made.
   However, this is furthest from the truth; if it wasn't the media and/or
   his dim-witted trend-following friends, would he be following the trend
   as well?  No.  Real smart youth.
3) It's fashionably 'hip' to declare 'I'll only vote Democrat.'  Of course
   the mindset is that 'Democrats are liberals,' and 'Republications are
   conservative.'  The furthest thing from the truth.  KNOW WHAT REPUBLICAN
   MEANS.  KNOW WHAT DEMOCRAT MEANS.  The STUPID youth of America doesn't
   realize that the current Administration promotes loss of freedoms, giving
   them to the hands of the Government.  The STUPID youth of America doesn't
   realize the Democrats PROMOTE higher taxes.  Both of these aforementioned
   issues go AGAINST what this country was founded on.  And that's just the
   tip of the iceberg.  Real smart youth.
4) With the fucking STUPID youth of America today, where does our future
   lie?  Obviously morals and respect have been lost over the past 50 years,
   now to a new low.  Where does the future lie?

                                  WAKE UP.

A Resurrection of Virtues must be done.  A Resurrection of the VALUES that
our country was founded upon.  With the current laws, taking away our
freedoms, with the current government, taking away ONE THIRD OR MORE OF OUR
INCOME, what is an individual left to do?

America in the 1700's didn't have it THIS BAD.  What was reason of the Boston
Tea Party?  A tax increase that is absolutely NOTHING compared to today's
standards.

The only solution is another revolt.  The only solution is to destroy our
current government and establish new ideals.  New ideals that refer back to
WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT WAS FOUNDED UPON IN THE FIRST PLACE. Thus, the gospel
sound of the men of B4B0 bring you:

                The 13 Point Program to Destroy America.

                           Coming in issue 09.
