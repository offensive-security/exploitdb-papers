       CYBERDOGGLES AND VIRTUAL PORK - A SCENARIO FOR INTERNET II

 By Carl Guderian <bjacques@usis.com>

 As one battle gets underway another is joined. While the EFF and others
 work to defend the noisy, colorful anarchy of the Net from the net.cops,
 the latter have begun gearing up for the endgame. If it's true that the
 electronic frontier is getting crowded while its newer colonists consider
 it too bare, then another system will be needed in a few years. That's the
 virtual Valley of Megiddo, the site of the (next) Final Battle between the
 techno-romantics and the corporate greyfaces. Internet II, or whatever
 they'll call it, is now only a vague idea in the minds of a few bureaucrats
 and infotainment industry execs, but it'll wind up a Mall of America,
 Panopticon, City of Quartz, or some other negative social metaphor (Brazil?).
 The first Internet grew up free because it was defined wholly by the users.
 Internet II, by contrast, will be a hybrid of corporate and government
 visions, combining the worst of both in a kind of Mendelian genetic
 distribution in which all offspring are defective. To the government it's
 a tax base and surveillance network; to industry it's a direct channel
 to a self-selecting, well-heeled market. To users the Internet is a
 community for which they've worked too hard to let it be taken away without
 a fight.

 The most obvious model for the Internet II standard is the U.S., or any
 other, civilian space program. It is about nothing so much as itself. The
 aerospace companies that are today inseparable from national space
 establishments make rockets or communications satellites. Like the designers
 of Internet II, they are concerned with delivering product (audiences) to
 the customers (advertisers). People generally support the space program
 because they hope it will open up space travel to everybody, from
 interplanetary honeymooners to lunar Libertarians (Jetsonian democracy!).
 Likewise, the Internet is popular because it's a vehicle for forming
 communities and getting free stuff. But Internet II will be about bandwidth,
 markets and security. The last item is emphasized because such a huge
 investment must be protected somehow, from the users of course. Whatever
 vision there might have been will be refocused instead on infrastructure.
 Call it information superhighway hypnosis, a trail of yellow stripes
 stretching to the horizon. Truly a vision to stir the soul.

 The pork barrel politics that characterize all big government projects will
 find a new arena on Internet II. The government can no longer pay for
 megaprojects like Internet II, but it can grant electronic Letters of
 Marque for companies to plunder the virtual seas under the federal colors.
 Obviously, the company or consortium that gets to write the new, none-dare-
 call-it-proprietary Internet protocols will have a leg up on competitors,
 sorta like the advantage Microsoft officially doesn't have over other
 developers for Windows.  In the current and upcoming Congressional funding
 battles, watch for posturing by lawmakers from whatever states the
 infotainment conglomerates call their nominal homes (Austin? Provo? Los
 Gatos?).

 The relatively meager funding doled out by the government will become an
 instrument of control, and privacy and free expression on Internet II will
 be the first to go. While Reagan preached getting the government off the
 backs of the people, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth (Mrs. Bob) Dole
 ordered states to raise drinking ages and enforce seat-belt laws or else
 lose federal funding for highway development. The states meekly complied.
 Would-be government contractors will be told, adopt a Clipper-like standard
 or don't bother to apply. Infotainment industry execs will be grilled by
 Congress for allowing "pone" on the net. Subsequently, said execs will
 promise to read private e-mail and censor discussions in exchange for easy
 passage of whatever bill they're promoting at the time. In 1985, the Parents
 Music Resource Center, led by Tipper (Mrs. Albert) Gore and financed by the
 likes of Mike Love of the Beach Boys, instigated Senatorial hearings on
 raunchy rock lyrics. Recording studio heads and distributors agreed to
 label and categorize "offensive" music in hopes Congress would tax blank
 tapes to offset revenue losses the industry attributed to home taping.
 Happily, the bill died and the hearings degenerated into a circus. But
 community standards on Internet II may be those of Memphis, Tennessee, if a
 recent court decision stands, and the only cyber-sex will be the user
 squealing like a pig for multimedia producers, petty bureaucrats, and self-
 appointed moral watchdogs. Government attempts to rein in the Internet
 community will continue no matter which party is in power. Repression smells
 the same whether it's for "national security," "community standards,"
 or raising PG kids in an X-rated world.

 Corporate plans for Internet II are even less palatable. The future dream
 is a shopping scheme, a Third Mall from the Sun. This corporate paradigm
 will kill the Internet as surely as will government interference and turn
 it into M-San Internet of shopkeepers. In a shopping mall the offerings are
 calculated to offend no one, so they please no one. Though a mall could, in
 theory, serve diverse interests, in reality it does not. Individual tastes
 being what they are, a customer could be offended by what it finds upon
 wandering into the wrong shop, and may leave the mall without buying
 anything. As a result, the mall loses the customer to a rival mall. To avoid
 this risk, the mall operator rents to shops with watered down selections,
 nothing too daring. Similarly, in a corporate online service, the range of
 allowable discussion topics is kept small to prevent users from who access
 the wrong discussion groups. Though itM-Xs possible to restrict access to the
 forum without censoring discussion within it, most services take the lazy way
 out and forbid them altogether, in case a user objects to their very
 existence. So much for open discussion on Internet II.

 The corporate vision accommodates shopkeepers who hate customers who browse
 but don't buy. Customers can turn a mall into a kind of public space for the
 price of a few sodas and pizza slices. Americans online on Internet II,
 however, will have to pay by the hour just to hang around. The ticking clock
 will prompt them to hurry up and pay for something to download. After being
 on the clock at work, consumers will get to log on and shop on the clock.
 Constant reminders of a rising bill will discourage idle chatting on the
 newsgroups, further restricting discussion on Internet II.

 Security will become an issue as cyberspace, once considered a kind of
 public space, becomes privatized. As with Los Angeles, Internet II will be
 vandalized by users who will take no pride in it because they will not own
 it. The Secret Service will work as mall cops for the owners of Internet II.
 The promise of "500 channels" betrays the limits of corporate vision.
 Internet II will be "one-to-many" like cable TV instead of the "many-to-many"
 structure of the common carriers, because the former facilitates billing and
 control by local monopolies. Also, customers are not accustomed to
 pay-per-call on a local line, but they're getting used to pay-per-view
 programming on cable. Will you cuss and spit when you drop offline during a
 rainstorm? You will...with [censored].

 In the end, the corporate Internet will be designed for consumption, not
 community. Online services consider the latter an impediment to steady
 profits. Bovine consumers shop contentedly on 500 channels; discontented
 talkers just hog the lines. If corporate services had to destroy online
 communities that spring up like weeds in their well-kept yards, they would.
 Fortunately, they wonM-Xt have to; the Online Mall is barren ground.

 By some estimates, 1998 is the deadline to keep the Net from turning into
 the Third Mall from the Sun or that sanitized 1901 Kansas-style underground
 city in "A Boy and His Dog."  Here are ways to kill that serpent in its
 shell.

 - Breathe down the necks of the architects of Internet II.
 Infotainment industry demands may require physical features that
 facilitate billing and copyright protection. The IRS and the cops will
 certainly want their own window into the Net. What the users want,
 assuming they know, is considered irrelevant. Change that by working
 through groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, but keep them from
 accepting "compromise" measures to wiretap "only" certain communications
 channels. It's like prison etiquette, in which the proper response to a
 proprietary hand on the shoulder is either a sock on the jaw or meek
 acceptance of what comes next. Given what's at stake, such a savage ethic
 applies. Freedom lent is freedom lost.

 - Boycott obvious government lapdogs.
 Do not surrender the Internet to the government; it has no legitimate
 claim to it. The Internet is like an abandoned military base built into a
 community by squatters. The original tenants have long ago gotten their
 money's worth from it and cannot take credit for the value added by the
 new settlers. The Internet communications standard, TCP/IP, which turned
 all the networks into the Internet, is public domain. The feds don't own
 it any more than they own the measurement of one U.S. gallon. The
 government still owns high-speed backbones, such as the National Science
 Foundation's NSFnet, and it can and does allow semi-private consortia like
 Merit to operate and maintain them. The users should claim the Internet,
 however, by usufruct ("fruitful use"), a legal concept under which
 squatters gain the right to occupy a structure in exchange for having
 improved it.  If all else fails, boycott Internet II and go back to
 TCP/IP. The latter may not have the bandwidth and the bells and whistles
 of Internet II, but it works well enough and won't have wiretap-friendly
 features built into it. Most projected growth will come from the online
 services dumping settlers by the millions on Internet II, taking the load
 off the present Internet. Currently dedicated but unused Internet addresses
 can be redistributed. TCP/IP, the current protocol, can support 20+ million
 people worldwide, which is probably the proportion of the population
 willing and able to protect their freedom online. Even without an Internet,
 there are systems that will work in a pinch, like FIDOnet, invented by Tom
 Jennings and a few others. Using personal computers and ordinary phone
 lines, FIDOnet delivers e-mail to 30,000+ sites in the world. So
 alternatives exist, though it would be a shame to have to abandon a
 community just when it was starting to mature.  De-evolution of the
 Internet community is a likely outcome but it's not inevitable. For the
 first time since the Whiskey Rebellion there's a chance to redirect
 American history from the seemingly endless march to centralized control.
 The technology is pretty cheap and widely available (unlike rockets), so
 it's a rare opportunity for real grass-roots action to create something
 that people can actually use. Internet doesn't have to go the way of other
 Big Science projects. But it will take a real fight; the other side won't
 deal if it doesn't think it has to. At stake is the future of the online
 community. Civilization built in an Autonomous Zone or pay-per-view
 surveillance (guess who pays?) in the Third Mall from the Sun:
 WHICH WILL IT BE? Those words fill the screen, accompanied by Raymond
 Massey whispering and chorus singing same, in "Things to Come."  Fadeout).

 The Third Mall from the Sun concept belongs to late comic genius Bill Hicks.
 Burn joss money in his memory to help cover his bar tab in the afterlife.

       EFF SUMMARY OF THE EDWARDS/LEAHY DIGITAL TELEPHONY BILL

 From Stanton McCandlish <mech@eff.org>

 OVERVIEW
 --------

 The Edwards/Leahy Digital Telephony bill places functional requirements on
 telecommunications carriers in order to enable law enforcement to continue
 to conduct authorized electronic surveillance. It allows a court to impose
 fines on carriers that violate the requirements, and mandates that the
 processes for determining capacity requirements and technical standards be
 open and public.  The bill also contains significant new privacy
 protections; including an increased standard for government access to
 transactional data (such as addressing information contained in electronic
 mail logs), a requirement that information acquired through the use of pen
 registers or trap and trace devices not disclose the physical location of an
 individual, and an expansion of current law to protect the radio portion of
 cordless telephone conversations from unauthorized surveillance.


 SCOPE OF THE BILL.  WHO IS COVERED?
 -----------------------------------

 The requirements of the bill apply to "telecommunications carriers", which
 are defined as any person or entity engaged in the transmission or
 switching of wire or electronic communications as a common carrier for hire
 (as defined by section 3 (h) of the Communications Act of 1934), including
 commercial mobile services (cellular, PCS, etc.).  The bill also applies to
 those persons or entities engaged in providing wire or electronic
 communication switching or transmission service to the extent
 that the FCC finds that such service is a replacement for a substantial
 portion of the local telephone exchange.

 The bill does not apply to online communication and information services
 such as Internet providers, Compuserve, AOL, Prodigy, and BBS's. It also
 excludes private networks, PBX's, and facilities which only interconnect
 telecommunications carriers or private networks (such as most long
 distance service).


 REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON CARRIERS
 --------------------------------

 Telecommunications carriers would be required to ensure that they
 possess sufficient capability and capacity to accommodate law enforcement's
 needs.  The bill distinguishes between capability and capacity
 requirements, and ensures that the determination of such requirements occur
 in an open and public process.


 CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS
 -----------------------

 A telecommunications carrier is required to ensure that, within four years
 from the date of enactment, it has the capability to:

 1.      expeditiously isolate the content of a targeted communication
         within its service area;

 2.      isolate call-identifying information about the origin and
         destination of a targeted communication;

 3.      enable the government to access isolated communications at a point
         away from the carrier's premises and on facilities procured by the
         government, and;

 4.      to do so unobtrusively and in such a way that protects the privacy
         and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted
         (Sec. 2601).

 However, the bill does not permit law enforcement agencies or officers to
 require the specific design of features or services, nor does it prohibit a
 carrier from deploying any feature or service which does not meet the
 requirements outlined above.


 CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS
 ---------------------

 Within 1 year of enactment of the bill, the Attorney General must
 determine the maximum number of intercepts, pen register, and trap and
 trace devices that law enforcement will require four years from the date of
 enactment.  Notices of capacity requirements must be published in the
 Federal Register (Sec. 2603).   Carriers have 4 years to comply with
 capacity requirements.

 PROCESS FOR DETERMINING TECH. STANDARDS TO IMPLEMENT CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Telecommunications carriers, through trade associations or standards
 setting bodies and in consultation with the Attorney General, must
 determine the technical specifications necessary to implement the
 capability requirements (Sec. 2606).

 The bill contains a 'safe harbor' provision, which allows a carrier to meet
 its obligations under the legislation if it is in compliance with publicly
 available standards set through this process.   A carrier may deploy a
 feature or service in the absence of technical standards, although in such
 a case the carrier would not be covered by the safe harbor provision and
 may be found in violation.

 Furthermore, the legislation allows any one to file a motion at the FCC in
 the event that a standard violates the privacy and security of
 telecommunications networks or does not meet the requirements of the bill
 (Sec. 2606).  If petitioned under this section, the FCC may establish
 technical requirements or standards that:

 1)      meet the capability requirements (in Sec. 2602);

 2)      protect the privacy and security of communications not authorized
         to be intercepted, and;

 3)      encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the
         public.


 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
 -------------------------

 In the event that a court or the FCC deems a technical standard to be
 insufficient, or if law enforcement finds that it is unable to conduct
 authorized surveillance because a carrier has not met the requirements of
 this legislation, the Attorney General can request that a court issue an
 enforcement order (an order directing a carrier to comply), and/or a fine
 of up to $10,000 per day for each day in violation (Sec. 2607).  However, a
 court can issue an enforcement order or fine a carrier only if it can be
 determined that no other reasonable alternatives are available to law
 enforcement.  This provision allows carriers to deploy features and
 services which may not meet the requirements of the bill.  Furthermore,
 this legislation does not permit the government to block the adoption or
 use of any feature or service by a telecommunications carrier which does
 not meet the requirements.

 The bill requires the government to reimburse carriers for all reasonable
 costs associated with complying with the capacity requirements. In other
 words, the government will pay for upgrades of current features or
 services, as well as any future upgrades which may be necessary, pursuant
 to published notices of capacity requirements (Sec. 2608).

 There is $500,000,000 authorized for appropriation to cover the costs of
 government reimbursements to carriers.  In the event that a smaller sum is
 actually appropriated, the bill allows a court to determine whether a
 carrier must comply (Sec. 2608 (d)).  This section recognizes that
 telecommunications carriers may not  be responsible for meeting the
 requirements if the government does not cover reasonable costs.

 The government is also required to submit a report to congress within four
 years describing all costs paid to carriers for upgrades (Sec. 4).


 ENHANCED PRIVACY PROTECTIONS
 ----------------------------

 The legislation contains enhanced privacy protections for transactional
 information (such as telephone toll records and electronic mail logs)
 generated in the course of completing a communication.  Current law permits
 law enforcement to gain access to transactional information through a
 subpoena.   The bill establishes a higher standard for law enforcement
 access to transactional data contained electronic mail logs and other
 online records.  Telephone toll records would still be available through a
 subpoena.   Under the new standard, law enforcement is required to obtain a
 court order by demonstrating specific and articulable facts that electronic
 mail logs and other online transactional records are relevant and material
 to an ongoing criminal investigation (Sec. 10).

 Law enforcement is also prohibited from remotely activating any
 surveillance capability.  All intercepts must be conducted with the
 affirmative consent of a telecommunications carrier and activated by a
 designated employee of the carrier within the carrier's facilities (Sec.
 2604).

 The bill further requires that, when using pen registers and trap and trace
 devices, law enforcement will use, when reasonably available, devices which
 only provide call set up and dialed number information (Sec. 10).  This
 provision will ensure that as law enforcement employs new technologies in
 pen register and trap and trace devices, it will not gain access to
 additional call setup information beyond its current authority.

 Finally, the bill extends the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
 protections against interception of wireless communications to cordless
 telephones, making illegal the intentional interception of the radio
 portion of a cordless telephone (the transmission between the handset
 and the base unit).


 CELLULAR SCANNERS
 -----------------

 The bill makes it a crime to possess or use an altered telecommunications
 instrument (such as a cellular telephone or scanning receiver) to obtain
 unauthorized access to telecommunications services (Sec. 9).  This
 provision is intended to prevent the illegal use of cellular and other
 wireless communications services.  Violations under this section face
 imprisonment for up to 15 years and a fine of up to $50,000.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Digital Telephony legislative proposal was first offered in 1992 by the
 Bush Administration.  The 1992 version of the bill:

 *       applied to all providers of wire or electronic communications
         services (no exemptions for information services, interexchange
         carriers or private networks);

 *       gave the government the explicit authority to block or enjoin a
         feature or service that did not meet the requirements;

 *       contained no privacy protections;

 *       contained no public process for determining the capacity
         requirements;

 *       contained no government reimbursement (carriers were responsible
         for meeting all costs);

 *       would have allowed remote access to communications by law
         enforcement, and;

 *       granted telecommunications carriers only 18 months to comply.

 The Bush Administration proposal was offered on capitol hill for almost a
 year, but did attract any congressional sponsors.

 The proposal was again offered under the Clinton Administration's FBI in
 March of 1993.  The Clinton Administration's bill was a moderated version
 of the original 1992 proposal:

 *       It required the government to pay all reasonable costs incurred by
         telecommunications carriers in retrofitting their facilities in
         order to correct existing problems;

 *       It encouraged (but did not require), the Attorney General to consult
         with telecommunications industry representatives and standards
         bodies to facilitate compliance,

 *       It narrowed the scope of the legislation to common carriers, rather
         than all providers of electronic communications services.

         Although the Clinton Administration version was an improvement
         over the Bush Administration proposal, it did not address the
         larger concerns of public interest organizations or the
         telecommunications industry.  The Clinton Administration version:

 *       did not contain any protections for access to transactional
         information;

 *       did not contain any public process for determining the capability
         requirements or public notice of law enforcement's capacity needs;

 *       would have allowed law enforcement to dictate system design and
         bar the introduction of features and services which did not meet
         the requirements, and;

 *       would have allowed law enforcement to use pen registers and trap and
         trace devices to obtain tracking or physical location information.

                              'ZINE FAQ

 By Jerod Pore (jerod23@well.sf.ca.us)

 This file is Shareright 1994 by Jerod Pore;  you may (and please do) copy,
 reproduce, replicate and distribute this information however, whereever
 and in whatever format, and as often as you wish, as long as this sentence
 is included.

 Answers to Frequently Asked Questions.

 What are zines?

 Zines are small press publications with a press run of 15 - 5,000.  They
 often deal with obscure or controversial subjects, or they're about the
 life of the publisher, or they're about the latest underground muzak
 sensation.

 How does one find out about zines?

 The best place to start is with Factsheet Five or Factsheet Five-Electric.
 We review 1,000 - 1,500 zines every three months (more or less).  We
 provide ordering information, size, quality of reproduction, contents and
 what we think about a zine.  Once you get a few zines that sound
 interesting, you'll notice other zines referred to.  Pretty soon you'll
 have more reading material then you know what to do with.


 How does one produce a zine?

 That's beyond the scope of this document.  But my stock answer is go to
 lunch at 11:30 am, get back by 12:15 and you should have plenty of time
 to use the equipment at school or at work.  Write down your thoughts (I
 suggest doing artwork on your own time), photocopy 40 or 50 copies, send
 one to us and to a few zines you think would be interested in yours.
 You may want to get the Zine Publishers' Resource guide, either $3.00
 from Seth at the address below, or the prior version is available from
 the ftp and gopher sites.


 How does one get the zines?

 When ordering zines, cash is the best medium of exchange.  Forget what
 your mother told you about evil thieves stealing one dollar bills out of
 mail boxes.  If you absolutely must send a check or money order (and a
 money order is preferred over a check), then make it out to the name in
 the address portion of the reviews.  However, many people publish zines
 under pseudonyms.  Unless available only for a ridiculous amount of money,
 just send cash.

 Many zines, especially personal zines, science fiction fanzines and
 anarchist zines are available for what is quaintly known as "The Usual."
 "The Usual" is your zine or tape or record or calendar in trade, or a
 well-written Letter of Comment on the subject of the zine, or $2 - $3.
 Be warned about a few things.  There are no guarantees.  Checks are
 likely to be thrown away.  Some zine names with especially offensive
 titles have often had their mail thrown away by self-righteous born-
 again postal workers, I kid you not!  If the name of the zine is apt to
 offend your third-grade teacher, don't put it on the envelope.  Some
 zines published in rather provincial parts of the world won't get their
 mail if the publisher's name isn't on the envelope, so whatever the name
 is in address, that's the name that should go on the envelope.  I can
 work only with what information is provided me.  I'll post any special
 requirements that are conveyed to me.  If a zine is free, you may want
 to help out with some stamps.  Free often translates as "The Usual," and
 many anarchists will accept food stamps.


 How to contact us with questions, etc. regarding F5 - either the paper
 or electronic versions.

 The email address for Factsheet Five and Factsheet Five - Electric is:
 jerod23@well.sf.ca.us

 Once upon a time, Seth had an email address.  It may be reactivated in the
 future.  The phone number for Factsheet Five (paper only) is +1-415-668-1781


 Where should stuff be sent?

 For anything that can't be sent electronically, which is most of the
 stuff we deal with;  comments, questions, feedback, donations, zines and
 other contributions to the defense of free expression rights around the
 world should be sent to either of these addresses:

 Factsheet Five
 Seth Friedman
 PO Box 170099
 San Francisco CA  94117-0099
 (This is the *only* address for subscriptions to the paper version)

 Factsheet Five
 Jerod Pore
 1800 Market St.
 San Francisco CA   94102-6297
 (This address is good for items that can't be sent to a PO Box)

 If you have a preference of reviewers, then send your zine to either of
 the above addresses as you see fit.  Please, though, send your zine to
 just *ONE* address.  Multiple copies just slow us down.  I do most of
 the Fringe, Hate, Rant, SubGenius and Science Fiction/Fantasy zines.
 Seth either reviews or distributes the rest.

 We have a couple of long-time reviewers for two niches.  They publish
 their own review zines so you get twice the coverage.  We must stress that
 you send poetry to Luigi-Bob, because poetry sent to San Francisco won't
 be reviewed for a couple of issues.

 Send your queer, bi or especially prurient zines to:

 Larry-bob
 Queer Zine Explosion
 PO Box 591275
 San Francisco CA  94159-1275

 Send all poetry or prose/poetry zines with lots of poetry to:

 Luigi-Bob Drake
 Burning Press
 PO Box 585
 Lakewood OH   44107

 How does one obtain the reviews of zines?

 The files that comprise Factsheet Five - Electric are available for
 online reading or downloading from WELL or with a gopher client with
 gopher gopher.well.sf.ca.us.  The files are also available via anonymous
 ftp from etext.archive.umich.edu in /pub/Factsheet.Five. The prior issue
 is in /pub/Factsheet.Five/Last.Issue. The WWW site is  http://www.well.com/
 You may subscribe to Factsheet Five - Electric by emailing me with
 "subscribe" in the subject line and your email address as the *entire* text.
 The files are sent out as they become available.  Email subscriptions are
 sent out *last*, as it's a real pain in the ass for me to deal with.
 F5-E is available from other ftp and gopher sites, as well as BBS's around
 the world, but I don't track other locations.


 What is the best method of receiving the review files?

 The WELL is the "best" place.  Not only is The WELL the greatest BBS in
 CyberSpace (no, I don't get a kickback;  I pay $30-50 a month to be on
 WELL) it's the homebase for F5 - Electric.  The most recent files are
 there.  Online zines that are sent to me are there.  News, gossip and
 rumours about zines and other underground media are there.  2600, Full
 Disclosure, bOING-bOING and other zinesters are there.  The
 WELL is, however, somewhat expensive at $15.00 a month and $2.00 an
 hour.  After WELL, ftp, gopher or WWW are the next best ways of getting
 the files.

 Our ftp sites accept anonymous as a login and your return address as a
 password.  For some people, especially those of you on FidoNet, Compu$erve
 and other services with email-only gateways to The Internet, email is the
 *only* way to get the files.   Unfornuately, the large file sizes (files
 range from 8 - 100k) prevent many locations from receiving them through
 email, especially uunet and uucp sites.



 How do ftp, gopher and WWW users know when new or updated files are
 available?

 For now, updates to F5-E will be announced in the newsgroups that
 attract people interested in zines:  alt.zines and rec.mag
 An excellent suggestion was made about having an email service that
 announces just the names of the new or updated files to ftp users.
 I've juggled two email subscription lists, so this idea will be too much
 of a hassle to implement. I don't know if the zines-list is still active.
 If it is, I might send announcements out that way.

 What is alt.zines?

 alt.zines is a Usenet newsgroup about zines.  It's where we discuss zine
 publishing, hype our zines, bitch about mainstream publications trying
 to coopt zines and so forth.  It's unmoderated, but there's a few of us
 there most of the time to answer these questions over&over&over and to
 point out that your slick publication about Christian technology with a
 circulation of over 150,000 is *not* a zine.

 Much of the posts in alt.zines are xposted to rec.mag, to benefit people
 at sites where the anal-retentive administrators refuse to carry the
 alt. hierarchy.


 May the files be reprinted or posted elsewhere?

 All files (just like this one) are shareright.  You may reproduce the
 information contained within them freely as long as others may reproduce
 that same information.  In other words, you may use but not copyright
 these files.  Shareright does not prevent you from charging money (or
 whatever your preferred medium of exchange is) for distribution.
 Including pertinent parts of this file, and giving credit to the
 reviewers is especially good for your karma, but not absolutely required
 to use what you wish of the review files.  We're more interested in the
 widespread dissemination of the information.  BBS operators are
 especially encouraged to make whatever files you deem appropriate
 available to your users.

 How does one submit reviews?

 For now, email the reviews to me.  This could be subject to change, once
 we work out everything.  Each file will have reviews of one or more
 zines that are somehow categorized together by subject matter or by
 reviewer.  Also feel free to post to alt.zines reviews of zines you have
 come across or to hype your own zines.  I've adopted the nerdy HTML format
 that is used for WWW browsing.

 While sticking to the format is nice, it is not necessary, as long as
 all pertinent information is included.  However if the reviews are to be
 accessible by the Web, then you had better do them this way.
 Please keep all reviews in vanilla ASCII format. Also keep them shareright.

 We are especially in need of reviews ezines and of zines that are published
 outside of North America.  Now, I get zines from Australia and, since I
 used to live there, I understand the dialect and cultural references.
 We don't have the resources to review zines that aren't published in
 English. I'd rather that F5-Electic not be an English only publication.
 If you get zines from other parts of the world and are willing to review
 them, please send the reviews to me.

 We are carrying a listing of ezines, thanks to johnl@netcom.com, but we
 would like to get more reviews of ezines, too.

 What are the subscription rates and/or sample copy prices for the print
 version of Factsheet Five?

 Single issues:
 US    Newsstand Cover Price:             $3.95  (Marketing sucks!)

 "We accept for payment cash (US or otherwise), check or money order drawn
 in US funds (payable to Factsheet Five), or IRCs (at the rate of $0.50
 each).  Prisoners may get single issues by paying in stamps."

 Please foward orders to:
 R. Seth Friedman
 P.O. Box 170099
 San Francisco, CA 94117-0099


 Will the subscription list (for the paper version) be sold?

 Seth plans making the list available to lots of cool companies like
 Archie McPhee, Blue Ryder, Co-Op America, and Kitchen Sink Press.  If
 you have an aversion to receiving cool catalogs and other neat stuff in
 the mail, just mention it with your order.  We'll be sure to keep your
 address private.

 What about the subscription list to the electronic version?

 The only thing I'll do with the email list is dump it when I get fed up
 with emailling huge files.

                        A POINT AND CLICK SOCIETY
                   LEARN TO DRIVE, OR GET OFF THE ROAD

                              An Editorial

 By Scott Davis (dfox@fc.net)

 As a computer support professional, I am unfortunate enough to see some
 of the developments pertaining to the Internet as they occur. I say
 "unfortunate" not because what I see is so terrible, but what I see never
 ceases to knock me off of my feet. What I am referring to is the massive
 wave of new people coming on to the "Inpho-s00per Highway" who if not for
 icons to click on and a mouse to click with, would not be able to use a
 personal computer...much less some global network. Uhh..uhh I thank I'm
 referrin' to that "Inter-Net" thang...

 People are being sucked into a revolution of digital "Everything".
 Computers do their taxes, balance their books, order groceries and other
 products, and deliver electronic mail...among other things. But, it bugs me
 to no end to see somebody with an e-mail address from AOL. It makes me
 want to mail them back and tell them "HEY! Did you know that you are on
 the dirt road that runs beside the Internet?" Or tell them to "Get out
 of the ghetto of the Internet." "Do you know what you're doing?"

 What the big companies have done is give the masses a loaded gun... and
 the masses have never fired a weapon in their life! They've given them
 a Porsche 944...and they've never driven a car. But I also question the
 common sense of the average computer user. "Do you know what this computer
 does?" The bottom line is that there are more things to do with this thing
 than point and click on all of your pretty applications.

 Services such as AOL promote things like "electronic mail" and "Access to
 the Internet". But how many people who purchased the software did any
 reading or research as to WHAT the Internet is. WHAT is electronic mail?
 I know that I'll probably get a thousand flames for this article, and
 they'll say 'We were all newbies once!" I am completely aware of that,
 but when we (people who have been on the Net for 5+ years) were new,
 we had to learn every aspect of what we were getting into. There was no
 point-and-click options. If we did not know command line operations,
 we didn't surf! One problem can be contributed to the press. This is
 the fact that they have made "The Internet" and Info-SuperHighway"
 buzz-phrases that people are going to be attracted to because they
 sound "cool".

 There are no PC-based computers being marketed without Dos and Windows
 to this editor's knowledge. When the customer sees "Dos and Windows",
 how many people do you think say, "Hey Look...it's got Dos too!"
 It simply does not happen. Who cares what an operating system is, right?
 Well, the fact is...you better care. Because without an operating system,
 you wouldn't be able to point and click on you pretty little icons.

 I commend AOL, Compuserve, Microsoft and others who develop software
 for the masses. They do a fine job and a great service to the world.
 Computing just would not be the same without them (I guess).

 Computers are being mass-marketed and distributed to the public like
 social security cards. For the big-boys in the industry, this is good.
 It means profit, jobs, and market-share...and that sometime soon, every
 household in America will have at least one computer (or doorstop) and the
 owner will not know the first thing about it.

 Commercial software manufacturers and Internet service providers are
 looking at this as a slaughter. Rounding up the cattle, as it were.
 This is fine with me, but it is the end-user's responsibility to
 do work on his/her own to know what this "Hi-Tek-Hiway" is. There are
 ways not to become sheep. And if you don't do your homework, you don't
 deserve better.

 I think that people should be required to attend some in-depth computer
 courses before being able to buy one.

 * Computer Basics: This class would last a total of 100 hours. Two hours
   a night, three nights a week.  Windows and other applications would not
   be discussed. The students would have to prove that they are proficient
   in Dos, Unix, or whatever command-line operating system their PC used.
   At the end of the 100 hour course, if they passed the command-line stuff,
   they would be permitted to attend a class that provided instruction
   on GUI's and other software.

 * Internet Basics 101:  If the sheep are so eager to get on this damn
   SuperHighway, learn what it is about. Learn where it origninated and
   what it can do. --- and learn how NOT to be a headache to others.
   Ethics would be a portion of the instruction. Learn who you are,
   evaluate your place on the Net, and know that no matter who you are...
   there are bigger and better hackers out there.

 * Learn the difference between the Highway and the shoulder.

 * What is "REAL" access and just a gateway to where you WISH you were.

 * Hardware Troubleshooting:  If my floppy disk drive is not working, I'd
   kinda like to know what to do to see if it is actually broken. If you
   purchased a $30,000 car and there were no service centers in the world,
   wouldn't you like to know how to change your oil?

 * Telecommunications Instruction:  What is a modem? What does it do?
   Learn how to use non-commercial telecom software. Find some modem
   software package that does not come from a major service provider
   or is not used with the most popular GUI in the world...and call up a
   few local bulletin board systems. Also, if my modem is not functioning,
   I'd like to know some of the reasons why, and try to correct them.

 These are some simple suggestions that I believe everyone should do before
 purchasing a computer system. Of course, if you have been using computers
 for an extended period of time and proclaim to know how they work, there
 would be a CLEP test for you. Answer 5 questions about hardware, three
 questions on Internet, and answer NO to the question "Do you use Windows?"
 and you'll be on your way home with that new system. This is certainly not
 an attempt to hammer commerical services and/or providers, certain
 software programs designed to make computing easier, or the people who
 use them. It's simply a statement saying "Know what you're doing, make
 yourself open to fluctuations in trends, educate yourself on global
 networking, and have a nice day." There is no excuse for ignorance. Open
 your documentation, go to the book store, whatever. Do your homework.
 Otherwise, pull over...you're going to jail for driving without a license.

 There are political fights going on right now over different aspects of
 this "SuperHighway" that you're so eager to get on. The decisions made
 will ultimately affect you. Do you care? You should. There are lawyers,
 lobbyists, organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
 and many individuals fighting for your right to use the services that
 you use. They are fighting to keep it "usable."

 In closing, be alert, be aware...and get educated. The light at the end of
 the tunnel to success might be a locomotive!

               KEYNOTE ADDRESS : CRYPTOGRAPHY CONFERENCE

 By Bruce Sterling (bruces@well.sf.ca.us)

       Hello everybody.  It's quite an honor to be delivering the
 keynote address -- a *thankfully brief* keynote address -- at this
 conference.  I hope to clear the decks in short order, and let you
 spend an engrossing afternoon, listening to an intense discussion of
 complex and important public issues, by highly qualified people, who
 fully understand what they're talking about.  Unlike myself.

       Before all this begins, though, I do want to establish a
 context for this conference.  Let me briefly put on my professional
 dunce-hat, as a popular-science writer, and try to make it clear to
 you exactly what the heck is going on here today.

 Cryptography.   The science and study of secret writing, especially
 codes and cypher systems.  The procedures, processes, measures and
 algorithms for making and using secret exchanges of information.
 *Secret*  exchanges, done, made and conducted without the knowledge of
 others, whether those others be governments, competitors, local, state
 or federal police, private investigators, wiretappers, cellular
 scanners, corporate security people, marketers, merchandisers,
 journalists, public health officials, squads for public decency,
 snoopy neighbors, or even your own spouse, your own parents, or your
 own children.

       Cryptography is a way to confine knowledge to the initiated and
 the privileged in your circle, whatever that circle might be:
 corporate co-workers, fellow bureaucrats, fellow citizens, fellow
 modem-users, fellow artists, fellow writers, fellow
 influence-peddlers, fellow criminals, fellow software pirates, fellow
 child pornographers.

       Cryptography is a way to assure the privacy of digital way to
 help control the ways in which you reveal yourself to the world.  It
 is also a way to turn everything inside a computer, even a computer
 seized or stolen by experts, into an utterly scrambled Sanskrit that
 no one but the holder of the key can read.  It is a swift, powerful,
 portable method of high-level computer security.   Electronic
 cryptography is potentially, perhaps, even a new form of information
 economics.

       Cryptography is a very hot issue in electronic civil liberties
 circles at the moment.  After years of the deepest, darkest,
 never-say-anything, military spook obscurity, cryptography is out of
 the closet and openly flaunting itself in the street.  Cryptography is
 attracting serious press coverage.  The federal administration has
 offered its own cryptographic cure-all, the Clipper Chip.
 Cryptography is being discussed openly and publicly, and practiced
 openly and publicly.  It is passing from the hands of giant secretive
 bureaucracies, to the desktop of the individual.   Public-key
 cryptography, in particular, is a strange and novel form of
 cryptography which has some very powerful collateral applications and
 possibilities, which can only be described as bizarre, and possibly
 revolutionary.   Cryptography is happening, and happening now.

       It often seems a truism in science and technology that it takes
 twenty years for anything really important to  happen:  well,
 Whitfield Diffie was publishing about public-key cryptography in 1975.
 The idea, the theory for much of what will be discussed today was
 already in place, theoretically, in 1975.  This would suggest a target
 date of 1995 for this issue to break permanently out of the arid world
 of theory, and into the juicy, down-and-dirty real world of politics,
 lawsuits, and money.  I rather think that this is a likely scenario.
 Personally, I think the situation's gonna blow a seam.  And by
 choosing to attend this EFF and EFF-Austin conference in September
 1993, you are still a handy two years ahead of the curve.  You can
 congratulate yourself!

       Why do I say blow a seam?  Because at this very moment, ladies
 and gentlemen, today, there is a grand jury meeting in Silicon Valley,
 under the auspices of two US federal attorneys and the US Customs
 Service.  That grand jury is mulling over possible illegality,
 possible indictments, possible heaven-knows-what, relating to supposed
 export-law violations concerning this powerful cryptography
 technology.  A technology so powerful that exporting cryptographic
 algorithms requires the same license that our government would grant
 to a professional armaments dealer.   We can envision this federal
 grand jury meeting, in San Jose California, as a kind of dark salute
 to our conference here in Austin, a dark salute from the forces of
 the cryptographic status quo.  I can guarantee you that whatever you
 hear at this conference today, is not gonna be the last you hear about
 this subject.

       I can also guarantee you that the people you'll be hearing from
 today are ideal people to tell you about these issues.  I wrote a book
 once, partly about some of these people, so I've come to know some of
 them personally.   I hope you'll forgive me, if I briefly wax all
 sentimental in public about how wonderful they are.  There will be
 plenty of time for us to get all hardened and dark and cynical later.
 I'll be glad to help do that, because I'm pretty good at that when I
 put my mind to it, but in the meantime, today, we should feel  lucky.
 We are lucky enough to have some people here who can actually tell us
 something useful about our future.  Our real future, the future we can
 actually have, the future we'll be living in,  the future that we can
 actually do something about.

       We have among us today the board of directors of the Electronic
 Frontier Foundation.  They are meeting in Austin in order to pursue
 strategy for their own national organization, but in the meantime,
 they also have graciously agreed to appear publicly and share their
 expertise and their opinions with us Austinites.  Furthermore, they
 are not getting a dime out of this; they are doing it, amazingly, out
 of sheer public-spiritedness.

       I'm going to introduce each of them and talk about them very
 briefly.  I hope you will reserve your applause until the end.
 Although these people deserve plenty of applause, we are short on
 quality applause resources.  In fact, today we will be rationing
 applause care, in order to assure a supply of basic, decent,
 ego-boosting applause for everyone, including those unable to
 privately afford top-quality applause care for the health of their own
 egos.  A federal-policy in-joke for the many Washington insiders we
 have in the room today.

       Very well,  on to the business at hand.  Mitch Kapor is a
 cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a software designer,
 a very prominent software entrepreneur, a philanthropist, a writer and
 journalist, and a civil liberties activist.  In 1990, when Mr. Kapor
 co-founded EFF, there was very considerable legal and constitutional
 trouble in the world of cyberspace.  Mitch spoke out on these
 sometimes-arcane, sometimes-obscure issues, and he spoke loudly,
 repeatedly, publicly, and very effectively.  And when Mitch Kapor
 finished speaking-out, those issues were no longer obscure or arcane.
 This is a gift Mitch has, it seems.  Mitch Kapor has also quietly done
 many good deeds for the electronic community, despite his full
 personal knowledge that no good deed goes unpunished.  We very likely
 wouldn't be meeting here today, if it weren't for Mitch, and anything
 he says will be well worth your attention.

       Jerry Berman is the President and Director of Electronic
 Frontier Foundation, which is based in Washington DC.  He is a
 longtime electronic civil liberties activist, formerly the founder and
 director of the Projects on Privacy and Information Technology for the
 American Civil Liberties Union.  Jerry Berman has published widely on
 the legal and legislative implications of computer security and
 electronic communications privacy, and his expertise in networks and
 the law is widely recognized.  He is heading EFF's efforts on the
 national information infrastructure in the very thick of the
 Clinton-Gore administration, and Mr Berman, as you might imagine, is a
 very busy man these days, with a lot of digital irons in the virtual
 fire.

       Mr. Kapor and Mr Berman will be taking part in our first panel
 today, on the topic of EFF's current directions in national public
 policy.  This panel will last from 1:45 to 3PM sharp and should be
 starting about fifteen minutes after I knock it off and leave this
 podium.   We will allow these well-qualified gentlemen to supply their
 own panel moderation, and simply tell us whatever is on their minds.
 And I rather imagine that given the circumstances, cryptography is
 likely to loom large.  And, along with the other panels, if they want
 to throw it open for questions from the floor, that's their decision.

       There will be a fifteen-minute break between each panel to
 allow our brains to decompress.

        Our second panel today, beginning at 3:15,  will be on the
 implications of cryptography for law enforcement and for industry, and
 the very large and increasingly dangerous areas where police and
 industry overlap in cyberspace.  Our participants will be Esther Dyson
 and Mike Godwin.

       Esther Dyson is a prominent computer-industry journalist.
 Since 1982, she has published a well-known and widely-read industry
 newsletter called Release 1.0.  Her industry symposia are justly
 famous, and she's also very well-known as an industry-guru in Central
 and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  Ms Dyson is very
 knowledgeable, exceptionally well-informed, and always a healthy
 distance ahead of her time.  When it comes to the computer industry,
 Esther Dyson not only knows where the bodies are buried, she has a
 chalk outline ready-and-waiting for the bodies that are still upright!
 She's on the Board of EFF as well as the Santa Fe Institute, the
 Global Business Network, the Women's Forum, and the Poynter Institute
 for Media Studies.

       Mike Godwin is the legal services council for EFF.  He is a
 journalist, writer, attorney, legal theorist, and legal adviser to the
 electronically distressed.  He is a veteran public speaker on these
 topics, who has conducted many seminars and taken part in many fora
 all over the United States.  He is also a former Austinite, a graduate
 of the UT School of Law, and a minor character in a William Gibson
 novel, among his other unique distinctions.  Mike Godwin is not only
 in EFF inside the beltway of Washington, but is on the board of the
 local group, EFF-Austin.  Mike Godwin is a well-known, one might even
 say beloved, character in the electronic community.  Mike Godwin is
 especially beloved to those among us who have had machinery sucked
 into the black hole of a federal search-and-seizure process.

       Our third panel today, beginning at 4:45,  will be the uniquely
 appropriate Cypherpunk Panel.  Our three barricade-climbing,
 torch-waving,  veteran manifesto-writers will be John Perry Barlow,
 John Gilmore and Eric Hughes.

       Mr Eric Hughes is NOT a member of the EFF Board of Directors.
 Mr Hughes is the moderator of the well-known, notorious even, Internet
 cypherpunk mailing list.  He is a private citizen and programmer from
 the Bay Area of California, who has a computer, has a modem, has
 crypto-code and knows how to use it!  Mr Hughes is here today entirely
 on his own, very considerable, initiative, and we of EFF-Austin are
 proud to have him here to publicly declare anything and everything
 that he cares to tell us about this important public issue.

       Mr John Gilmore *is* a member of the EFF Board.  He is a
 twenty-year veteran programmer, a pioneer in Sun Microsystems and
 Cygnus Support, a stalwart of the free software movement, and a
 long-term electronic civil libertarian who is very bold and forthright
 in his advocacy of privacy, and of private encryption systems.   Mr
 Gilmore is, I must say, remarkable among UNIX and GNU programmers for
 the elegance and clarity of his prose writings.  I believe that even
 those who may disagree with Mr Gilmore about the complex and important
 issues of cryptography, will be forced to admit that they actually
 understand what Mr Gilmore is saying.  This alone makes him a
 national treasure.  Furthermore, John Gilmore has never attended
 college, and has never bought a suit.  When John Gilmore speaks his
 mind in public, people should sit up straight!

       And our last introductee is the remarkable John Perry Barlow.
 Journalist, poet, activist, techno-crank, manifesto-writer, WELLbeing,
 long-time lyricist for the Grateful Dead, co-founder of Electronic
 Frontier Foundation, member of the Wyoming Republican Party, a man who
 at last count had at least ten personal phone numbers, including two
 faxes, two cellulars and a beeper;  bon vivant, legend in his own
 time, a man with whom superlatives fail, art critic, father of three,
 contributing editor of MONDO 2000, a man and a brother that I am proud
 to call truly *my kind of guy:* John Perry Barlow.

       So these are our panelists today, ladies and gentlemen:  a fine
 group of public-spirited American citizens who, coincidentally, happen
 to have a collective IQ high enough to boil platinum.   Let's give
 them a round of applause.

       (((frenzied applause)))

       Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, EFF-Austin is not the EFF.
 We are a local group with our own incorporation and our own unique
 organizational challenges.  We are doing things on a local scale,
 where the National EFF  cannot operate.  But we know them, and we
 *like* them, and we are proud to have them here.  Furthermore, every
 time some Austin company, such as Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, or
 the currently unlucky Austin Codeworks, publishers of a program called
 "Moby Crypto," find themselves in some strange kind of federal hot
 water, we are not only proud to know the EFF, we are *glad* to know
 them.  Glad, and *grateful!*   They have a lot to tell us today, and
 they are going to tell us things they believe we really need to know.
 And after these formal panels, this evening from 8 to 10, we are
 going to indulge in a prolonged informal session of what we Austinites
 are best at:  absorbing alcohol,  reminiscing about the Sixties, and
 making what Mitch Kapor likes to call "valuable personal contacts."

       We of EFF-Austin are proud and happy to be making information
 and opinion  on important topics and issues available to you, the
 Austin public, at NO CHARGE!!

       Of course, it would help us a lot, if you bought some of the
 unbelievably hip and with-it  T-shirts we made up for this gig, plus
 the other odd and somewhat overpriced, frankly, memorabilia and
 propaganda items that we of EFF-Austin sell, just like every other
 not-for-profit organization in the world.  Please help yourself to
 this useful and enlightening stuff, so that the group can make more
 money and become even more ambitious than we already are.

       And on a final note, for those of you who are not from Austin,
 I want to say to you as an Austinite and member of EFF-Austin, welcome
 to our city.  Welcome to the Capital of Texas.  The River City.  The
 City of the Violet Crown.  Silicon Hills.  Berkeley-on-the-Colorado.
 The Birthplace of Cyberpunk.  And the Waterloo of the Chicago Computer
 Fraud and Abuse Task Force.

       You are all very welcome here.

       So today,  let's all learn something, and let's all have some
 fun.  Thanks a lot.

                       JACKBOOTS ON THE INFOBAHN

 By John Perry Barlow (WIRED 2.04)

 Clipper is a last ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power
 from the old Industrial Era, to establish imperial control over cyberspace.

 On January 11, I managed to schmooze myself aboard Air Force 2. It was
 flying out of LA, where its principal passenger had just outlined his
 vision of the information superhighway to a suited mob of television, show-
 biz, and cable types who  fervently hoped to own it one day - if they could
 ever figure out what the hell it was.

 From the standpoint of the Electronic Frontier Foundation the speech had
 been wildly encouraging. The administration's program, as announced by Vice
 President Al Gore, incorporated many of the concepts of open competition,
 universal access, and  deregulated common carriage that we'd been pushing
 for the previous year.

 But he had said nothing about the future of privacy, except to cite among
 the bounties of the NII its ability to "help law enforcement agencies
 thwart criminals and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications
 to commit crimes."

 On the plane I asked Gore what this implied about administration policy on
 cryptography. He became as noncommittal as a cigar-store Indian. "We'll be
 making some announcements.... I can't tell you anything more." He hurried
 to the front of the  plane, leaving me to troubled speculation.

 Despite its fundamental role in assuring privacy, transaction security, and
 reliable identity within the NII, the Clinton administration has not
 demonstrated an enlightenment about cryptography up to par with the rest of
 its digital vision.

 The Clipper Chip - which threatens to be either the goofiest waste of
 federal dollars since President Gerald Ford's great Swine Flu program or,
 if actually deployed, a surveillance technology of profound malignancy -
 seemed at first an ugly legacy  of the Reagan-Bush modus operandi. "This is
 going to be our Bay of Pigs," one Clinton White House official told me at
 the time Clipper was introduced, referring to the disastrous plan to invade
 Cuba that Kennedy inherited from Eisenhower.

 (Clipper, in case you're just tuning in, is an encryption chip that the
 National Security Agency and FBI hope will someday be in every phone and
 computer in America. It scrambles your communications, making them
 unintelligible to all but their  intended recipients. All, that is, but the
 government, which would hold the "key" to your chip. The key would
 separated into two pieces, held in escrow, and joined with the appropriate
 "legal authority.")

 Of course, trusting the government with your privacy is like having a
 Peeping Tom install your window blinds. And, since the folks I've met in
 this White House seem like extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers -
 hell, a lot of them are Deadheads -  I was sure that after they were fully
 moved in, they'd face down the National Security Agency and the FBI, let
 Clipper die a natural death, and lower the export embargo on reliable
 encryption products.

 Furthermore, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the
 National Security Council have been studying both Clipper and export
 embargoes since April. Given that the volumes of expert testimony they had
 collected overwhelmingly opposed  both, I expected the final report would
 give the administration all the support it needed to do the right thing.

 I was wrong. Instead, there would be no report. Apparently, they couldn't
 draft one that supported, on the evidence, what they had decided to do
 instead.

 THE OTHER SHOE DROPS

 On Friday, February 4, the other jackboot dropped. A series of
 announcements from the administration made it clear that cryptography would
 become their very own "Bosnia of telecommunications" (as one staffer put
 it). It wasn't just that the old  Serbs in the National Security Agency and
 the FBI were still making the calls. The alarming new reality was that the
 invertebrates in the White House were only too happy to abide by them.
 Anything to avoid appearing soft on drugs or terrorism.

 So, rather than ditching Clipper, they declared it a Federal Data
 Processing Standard, backing that up with an immediate government order for
 50,000 Clipper devices. They appointed the National Institutes of Standards
 and Technology and the  Department of Treasury as the "trusted" third
 parties that would hold the Clipper key pairs. (Treasury, by the way, is
 also home to such trustworthy agencies as the Secret Service and the Bureau
 of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.)

 They reaffirmed the export embargo on robust encryption products, admitting
 for the first time that its purpose was to stifle competition to Clipper.
 And they outlined a very porous set of requirements under which the cops
 might get the keys to your  chip. (They would not go into the procedure by
 which the National Security Agency could get them, though they assured us
 it was sufficient.)

 They even signaled the impending return of the dread Digital Telephony, an
 FBI legislative initiative requiring fundamental reengineering of the
 information infrastructure; providing wiretapping ability to the FBI would
 then become the paramount  design priority.

 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS

 Actually, by the time the announcements thudded down, I wasn't surprised by
 them. I had spent several days the previous week in and around the White
 House.

 I felt like I was in another remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
 My friends in the administration had been transformed. They'd been subsumed
 by the vast mindfield on the other side of the security clearance membrane,
 where dwell the  monstrous bureaucratic organisms that feed on fear. They'd
 been infected by the institutionally paranoid National Security Agency's
 Weltanschauung.

 They used all the telltale phrases. Mike Nelson, the White House point man
 on the NII, told me, "If only I could tell you what I know, you'd feel the
 same way I do." I told him I'd been inoculated against that argument during
 Vietnam. (And it does  seem to me that if you're going to initiate a
 process that might end freedom in America, you probably need an argument
 that isn't classified.)

 Besides, how does he know what he knows? Where does he get his information?
 Why, the National Security Agency, of course. Which, given its strong
 interest in the outcome, seems hardly an unimpeachable source.

 However they reached it, Clinton and Gore have an astonishingly simple
 bottom line, to which even the future of American liberty and prosperity is
 secondary: They believe that it is their responsibility to eliminate, by
 whatever means, the  possibility that some terrorist might get a nuke and
 use it on, say, the World Trade Center. They have been convinced that such
 plots are more likely to ripen to hideous fruition behind a shield of
 encryption.

 The staffers I talked to were unmoved by the argument that anyone smart
 enough to steal a nuclear device is probably smart enough to use PGP or
 some other uncompromised crypto standard. And never mind that the last
 people who popped a hooter in the  World Trade Center were able to get it
 there without using any cryptography and while under FBI surveillance.

 We are dealing with religion here. Though only ten American lives have been
 lost to terrorism in the last two years, the primacy of this threat has
 become as much an article of faith with these guys as the Catholic
 conviction that human life begins  at conception or the Mormon belief that
 the Lost Tribe of Israel crossed the Atlantic in submarines.

 In the spirit of openness and compromise, they invited the Electronic
 Frontier Foundation to submit other solutions to the "problem" of the
 nuclear-enabled terrorist than key escrow devices, but they would not admit
 into discussion the argument that  such a threat might, in fact, be some
 kind of phantasm created by the spooks to ensure their lavish budgets into
 the post-Cold War era.

 As to the possibility that good old-fashioned investigative techniques
 might be more valuable in preventing their show-case catastrophe (as it was
 after the fact in finding the alleged perpetrators of the last attack on
 the World Trade Center), they  just hunkered down and said that when
 wiretaps were necessary, they were damned well necessary.

 When I asked about the business that American companies lose because of
 their inability to export good encryption products, one staffer essentially
 dismissed the market, saying that total world trade in crypto goods was
 still less than a billion  dollars. (Well, right. Thanks more to the
 diligent efforts of the National Security Agency than to dim sales
 potential.)

 I suggested that a more immediate and costly real-world effect of their
 policies would be to reduce national security by isolating American
 commerce, owing to a lack of international confidence in the security of
 our data lines. I said that Bruce  Sterling's fictional data-enclaves in
 places like the Turks and Caicos Islands were starting to look real-world
 inevitable.

 They had a couple of answers to this, one unsatisfying and the other scary.
 The unsatisfying answer was that the international banking community could
 just go on using DES, which still seemed robust enough to them. (DES is the
 old federal Data  Encryption Standard, thought by most cryptologists to be
 nearing the end of its credibility.)

 More frightening was their willingness to counter the data-enclave future
 with one in which no data channels anywhere would be secure from
 examination by one government or another. Pointing to unnamed other
 countries that were developing their own  mandatory standards and
 restrictions regarding cryptography, they said words to the effect of,
 "Hey, it's not like you can't outlaw the stuff. Look at France."

 Of course, they have also said repeatedly - and for now I believe them -
 that they have absolutely no plans to outlaw non-Clipper crypto in the US.
 But that doesn't mean that such plans wouldn't develop in the presence of
 some pending "emergency."  Then there is that White House briefing
 document, issued at the time Clipper was first announced, which asserts
 that no US citizen "as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable
 commercial encryption product."

 Now why, if it's an ability they have no intention of contesting, do they
 feel compelled to declare that it's not a right? Could it be that they are
 preparing us for the laws they'll pass after some bearded fanatic has
 gotten himself a surplus nuke  and used something besides Clipper to
 conceal his plans for it?

 If they are thinking about such an eventuality, we should be doing so as
 well. How will we respond? I believe there is a strong, though currently
 untested, argument that outlawing unregulated crypto would violate the
 First Amendment, which surely  protects the manner of our speech as clearly
 as it protects the content.

 But of course the First Amendment is, like the rest of the Constitution,
 only as good as the government's willingness to uphold it. And they are, as
 I say, in the mood to protect our safety over our liberty.

 This is not a mind-frame against which any argument is going to be very
 effective. And it appeared that they had already heard and rejected every
 argument I could possibly offer.

 In fact, when I drew what I thought was an original comparison between
 their stand against naturally proliferating crypto and the folly of King
 Canute (who placed his throne on the beach and commanded the tide to leave
 him dry), my government  opposition looked pained and said he had heard
 that one almost as often as jokes about roadkill on the information
 superhighway.

 I hate to go to war with them. War is always nastier among friends.
 Furthermore, unless they've decided to let the National Security Agency
 design the rest of the National Information Infrastructure as well, we need
 to go on working closely with  them on the whole range of issues like
 access, competition, workplace privacy, common carriage, intellectual
 property, and such. Besides, the proliferation of strong crypto will
 probably happen eventually no matter what they do.

 But then again, it might not. In which case we could shortly find ourselves
 under a government that would have the automated ability to log the time,
 origin and recipient of every call we made, could track our physical
 whereabouts continuously,  could keep better account of our financial
 transactions than we do, and all without a warrant. Talk about crime
 prevention!

 Worse, under some vaguely defined and surely mutable "legal authority,"
 they also would be able to listen to our calls and read our e-mail without
 having to do any backyard rewiring. They wouldn't need any permission at
 all to monitor overseas calls.

 If there's going to be a fight, I'd rather it be with this government than
 the one we'd likely face on that hard day.

 Hey, I've never been a paranoid before. It's always seemed to me that most
 governments are too incompetent to keep a good plot strung together all the
 way from coffee break to quitting time. But I am now very nervous about the
 government of the  United States of America.

 Because Bill 'n' Al, whatever their other new-paradigm virtues, have
 allowed the very old-paradigm trogs of the Guardian Class to define as
 their highest duty the defense of America against an enemy that exists
 primarily in the imagination - and is  therefore capable of anything.

 To assure absolute safety against such an enemy, there is no limit to the
 liberties we will eventually be asked to sacrifice. And, with a Clipper
 Chip in every phone, there will certainly be no technical limit on their
 ability to enforce those  sacrifices.

 WHAT YOU CAN DO

 GET CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CRYPTO EMBARGO

 The administration is trying to impose Clipper on us by manipulating market
 forces. By purchasing massive numbers of Clipper devices, they intend to
 induce an economy of scale which will make them cheap while the export
 embargo renders all  competition either expensive or nonexistent.

 We have to use the market to fight back. While it's unlikely that they'll
 back down on Clipper deployment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
 believes that with sufficient public involvement, we can get Congress to
 eliminate the export embargo.

 Rep. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, has a bill (H.R. 3627) before the
 Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee
 on Foreign Affairs that would do exactly that. She will need a lot of help
 from the public. They may not  care much about your privacy in DC, but they
 still care about your vote.

 Please signal your support of H.R. 3627, either by writing her directly or
 e-mailing her at cantwell@eff.org. Messages sent to that address will be
 printed out and delivered to her office. In the subject header of your
 message, please include the  words "support HR 3627." In the body of your

 BOYCOTT CLIPPER DEVICES AND THE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE THEM.

 Don't buy anything with a Clipper Chip in it. Don't buy any product from a
 company that manufactures devices with Big Brother inside. It is likely
 that the government will ask you to use Clipper for communications with the
 IRS or when doing business  with federal agencies. They cannot, as yet,
 require you to do so. Just say no.

 LEARN ABOUT ENCRYPTION AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES TO YOUR UNWIRED FRIENDS

 The administration is banking on the likelihood that this stuff is too
 technically obscure to agitate anyone but nerds like us. Prove them wrong
 by patiently explaining what's going on to all the people you know who have
 never touched a computer and  glaze over at the mention of words like
 "cryptography."

 Maybe you glaze over yourself. Don't. It's not that hard. For some hands-on
 experience, download a copy of PGP - Pretty Good Privacy - a shareware
 encryption engine which uses the robust RSA encryption algorithm. And learn
 to use it.

 GET YOUR COMPANY TO THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING REAL CRYPTOGRAPHY IN ITS PRODUCTS

 If you work for a company that makes software, computer hardware, or any
 kind of communications device, work from within to get them to incorporate
 RSA or some other strong encryption scheme into their products. If they say
 that they are afraid to  violate the export embargo, ask them to consider
 manufacturing such products overseas and importing them back into the
 United States. There appears to be no law against that. Yet.

 You might also lobby your company to join the Digital Privacy and Security
 Working Group, a coalition of companies and public interest groups -
 including IBM, Apple, Sun, Microsoft, and, interestingly, Clipper phone
 manufacturer AT&T - that is  working to get the embargo lifted.

 ENLIST!

 Self-serving as it sounds coming from me, you can do a lot to help by

 In his LA speech, Gore called the development of the NII "a revolution."
 And it is a revolutionary war we are engaged in here. Clipper is a last
 ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old
 Industrial Era, to establish  imperial control over cyberspace. If they
 win, the most liberating development in the history of humankind could
 become, instead, the surveillance system which will monitor our
 grandchildren's morality. We can be better ancestors than that.

                         NOTES FROM CYBERSPACE
                               VOLUME 3

 By Jonathan Yarden (jyarden@iglou.iglou.com)
 Subject: Mosaic on Digital Satellite System

 Anyone else out there getting a serious hard-on on the Digital Satellite
 System?  From what I have heard this puppy is doing IP via satellite.
 For that matter, I can't think of any other real way to do what it does.
 Here is a partial list of 'features:'

 1. The DSS system is designed to asychronously receive data.  Each DSS
 receiver has a unique ID allowing it to process packetized wide-band data
 (which in most cases is MPEG encoded video).  This happens *whenever* the
 unit is operational.

 2. The modem in the DSS receiver is for the sending of requests and
 receipt of data from a local or long distance 'service.' The majority of
 requests are for 'keys' to decode channels, but could also be used to send
 subscription requests for other services.

 3. There is a magnetic 'card' used to hold information about the types of
 services currently subscribed to by the DSS user.  The card is readable
 as well as writeable.

 THE BIG IDEA

 Knowing that data flow in Mosaic is almost 99% server to client, this
 opens up a rather fast way to do Mosaic.  For that matter, since most of
 the people who surf are just passing thru or getting data, this is a fast
 data pipe to just about anything.  The only catch would be that the
 sending speed would be maxed out at about 14.4kbps.  But, if you are on
 the client end of a 2GB FTP session, well you get the picture...

 2nd reason:

 According to TRACEROUTE (unix hamsters, try this at home...) CIX is
 basically 'metering' data traffic onto their routes.  First 16K goes real
 fast, then you hit the bottom of the process queue (sounds VAXen, doesn't
 it?) and it's the loser in a snail race.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEND MAIL TO YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS ASKING THEM
 IF THEY OFFER THEIR SYSTEM LOGS TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES - ESPECIALLY IF
 YOU LIVE IN TEXAS.  ACTIONS SUCH AS THIS MAY BE A VIOLATION OF YOUR
 PRIVACY.  IF YOU DISCOVER THIS TO BE THE CASE, MAIL US!

                        PORNOGRAPHY FOULS INTERNET

 By Paul Pihichyn (pihichyn@freepress.mb.ca)

 There is a river of slime in the gutters of the information highway
 and it's giving cyberspace a bad name.  The virtual community, it appears,
 has been invaded by the same scum that has slithered into the real
 communities across the land.  We're talking pornography, with a capital P,
 right there on the Internet.

 Maybe you caught the report on CNN last week about the Lawrence Livermore
 Laboratory in California.  It seems some sleezeball there had loaded several
 gigabytes of filth into a server that was connected to the Internet, and
 promptly made it available to all 20 million-plus 'Netsurfers.  It's
 probably not surprising that in a community of 20 million, you are going to
 find the same sad mix that you will find in the general population.  But,
 somehow, I though the Internet would attract a better class of humanity.

 Nevertheless, the Internet has become the largest and most accessable source
 of pornographic material on the planet - and the real danger is it's
 accessible to anyone with a PC and modem, even to children.

 Journalist Erik Lacitis (elak.news@times.com) said it best recently in the
 Seattle times: "... has there ever been a bigger collection of mean-
 spirited, emotionally-deficient, just plain-weird, and mostly utterly
 boring people?"  He prefaced the remark by saying he was taking a vacation
 from the Internet and going back to the real world. Actually, it would make
 more sense for those 'Net-bound weirdos to be taking a reality check.

 Hiding behind their cloak of anonymity, these folks hurl hateful insults at
 those with whom they disagree or feel they can bully by virtue of their
 perceived superior knowledge of the nooks and crannies of the Internet.
 It is on the Usenet that these really dumb things often take place. Now tell
 me, does the world really need a forum called alt.sex.pictures.female,
 or alt.sex.bondage?  Or maybe just plain old alt.sex? I think not.

 The crap on these forums is pretty crude.  Obscene by many community
 standards.  And also pretty silly.  Racy stories written by pimply-faced
 adolescent boys pretending to be ravishingly over-sexed and under-loved
 young women is hardly the stuff on which to build a world-wide information
 superhighway.

 Remember, the Internet is a network of networks, each linked through a host
 site - often a university or some other educational facility.  Some of these
 host sites have taken steps to clean up their little corner of the Internet.

 Troll Usenet through the server at the University of Manitoba, and you won't
 find the newsgroups alt.sex.pictures.female, or alt.sex.bondage.
 The U of M, along with several other Internet providers, has denied its
 users access to some of the more blatantly pornographic newsgroups. Though
 some people may complain that this is censorship, an infringement on the
 freedom of the Internet, I take my hat off to those who made the decision
 to try to keep the Internet decent place to work and play.

 There have been incidents reported of Internet users actually being stalked,
 electronically, by some of the weirder weirdoes out there.  The really scary
 part is that some of the cyberstalkers have actually slithered into the real
 world and attempted face-to-face encounters.

 The 'Net anonymity also give a lot of jerks a chance to be mean.  If there
 is a crude remark that has ever been made about women, you'll find it posted
 on the 'Net.  It seems, as Lacitis wrote, the Internet is populated with
 men who never grew up.

 Big as it is, the Internet is still in its infancy.  It will take time to
 gain some maturity, to find a way to weed out the cretins and perverts.
 Once you get around the crud on the Internet, you will find it a wonderful
 place to learn, work and do business.

                     ON THE SUBJECT OF CYBERCULTURE

 By George Phillips (ice9@fennec.com)

 I hate to be an asshole, but my friends will tell you I'm pretty good at it.
 I usually try to keep an open mind about a lot of things, but some things
 just get under my skin.  Today, it's this damn cyberculture thingy! I
 thought the hype was subsiding, but now it seems to have sprouted back up
 like a festering pustule on the mouths of everyone.  Let's just ask the
 question: What is cyberculture?  Is it some coffee-shop hallucination
 romance dreamed up by some art-school boy with no social outlet? Is it some
 third-rate term developed by the editors of certain magazines to justify
 their existance? Was it created from a desperate attempt at giving a name to
 people who just don't fit in? ...or is there something real to all this
 fantasy? Let's take a closer look.

 I went out and looked for anything "cyber." Magazines, books, people, places,
 clothes, and things. I started out by picking up a magazine called
 "Mondo-2000".  I'm sure I heard somewhere that this was a "cyber-oriented"
 magazine. The cover art did nothing for me as far as helping define what
 "cyber" was. After a time, I quickly realized that this magazine caters to
 junior/highschool children with Nintendos and acne.  I saw nothing "cyber"
 about it.  In fact, I really saw no real culture. Sure it had art, music,
 graphics, features, etc...but doesn't every magazine? What is keeping me
 from calling Time or Newsweek "Cyber-mags"? Could it be?  Is "cyber" just
 another buzz-word like "virtual?"  No!

 William Gibson writes about people in the future accessing a matrix called
 cyberspace.  This is the "virtual" area between computer systems.  No doubt
 one can see the parallels between his matrix and our Internet.  But is this
 all there is to it?  No.  There are people called "cyberpunks" that access
 this matrix and exploit it to their own ends.  These are very good books, by
 the way.  I enjoyed reading them.  There has got to be a parallel between
 his cyberpunks and the hackers of today. Although the books are excellent,
 I have yet to see what "Cyber-Culture" is.  (Hearing theme song from
 Jeopardy in my head...)

 Billy Idol recorded an album called CyberPunk. Chained to my chair and
 threatened with death if I did not listen to this "K-Rad" CD, I formed the
 opinion that Billy Idol has too much free time on his hands. The makeup of
 this album has absolutely nothing to do with the title, or subjects in any
 William Gibson book.  Thats not to say its not a good album.  I'm sure there
 are many out there who like his work, but as far as my quest was concerned,
 this was a dead end.  I just don't comprehend the reasoning behind such
 a venture.

 Exhausted with my household search for the eternal answer, I decided to
 hit the streets and find some real, live, cyber-people. I heard that this
 culture usually hangs out in clubs or raves that play loud alternative
 industrial dance music.  I found a couple places like that in Houston and
 Austin, so I decided to give it a try.  I chose a club in Houston, Texas.
 The lights were hypnotic.  The smart-drinks were flowing. The people were
 dancing and zoning on the special effects of the club.  I picked out the
 most "cyber-looking" people I could find.  I knew what to look for because I
 just recently picked through a Mondo-2000 magazine to see what their be-all
 end-all definition of a cyber-person was.  These people could barely figure
 out how to turn on a computer!  How could they call themselves "cyber?"
 Am I wrong when I say that the whole term "Cyber" has at least SOMETHING to
 do with computers? Needless to say, I was rather disappointed in the
 ignorance of these lifeless wanna-bees and misled by all of the advertising
 of this ever-elusive "Cyber-Culture". Color me confused.

 Well, I figured that if anyone knew about "Cyber-Culture," it would have to
 be the computer underground.  This is supposed to be one of the smartest,
 most alternitive, techno-literate group around. There was a convention going
 on in Las Vegas called DefCon II. Played-up to be one of the largest
 gatherings of computer underground enthusiasts, I had to go. Although it is
 sad that this term "Cyber", while used so widely today, is hard to define.
 I am sad that I had to go to Las Vegas to find "Cyber"...if it was even
 there.

 This was obviously a place where "cyber-culture" came together!  I decided
 to attend and look around.  What I found was a large group of people
 drinking, smoking, viewing porn and talking about the latest security holes.
 These people were nothing like the people in Mondo-2000 or any other
 Cyber-rags.  Where was their strange, multi-color clothing?  So this is
 cyber-culture?

 I hit a few coffee shops, followed a group that I would bet that I saw in
 Mondo, tried psudo-virtual-reality hangouts, tried their smart drinks,
 smoked their tobacco, attempted being "trendy", and contemplated art
 in the most cyber-sense. My return: ZIP! NADA! NOTHING!

 From all of my travels and studies, I came up with a few theories.  Although
 possibly distorted, I feel they are, for the most part true.

 Cyberculture is:

  1) A bunch of burn-outs in a coffee shop, reading trendy "alternative"                              magazines, analyzing "alternative" music, and going to raves.

  2) A bunch of kids doing large amounts of drugs, drinking smart-drinks,
     wearing flanel, attending "alternative" concerts like Woodstock '94
     hopelessly babbling on about topics that they know nothing about.

  3) Cigarettes and alcohol.

 I find none of these interesting and frankly, I don't see whats so damn
 fascinating about them! ...and still cannot determine why it is called
 "Cyber".  I am getting to hate this term more each time I have to write or
 say it...because it means NOTHING!

 So, if anyone finds "Mr. or Ms. Cyber" please let me know. I am not claiming
 to be a know-it-all, but when the press, the public, and society in general
 latches on to a term which evidently globally-defines a people or attitude,
 and THEN rams it down my throat on the front page of the newspaper and on
 the six o' clock news, I have the RIGHT to know what in the hell it means.

 Have a virtual-cyber-underground-mondo-networkable-fiber-opticable day!

 Alternative viewpoints are not welcome because this is my cyber-column.
 Get your own! Take a pill and get a life.

                           A COMMENT ON CLIPPER

 By Azrael (reinoa@ccaix3.unican.es)

 Greetings to all fellow cyberpunks, hackers, modem enthusiasts,
 programmers, viri-coders, civil-rights activists, anarchists, crypto-
 mathematicians and all.

 The echoes of the Clipper polemics are heard even here in Spain, mainly
 thru a distorted view given by the pre-net mass media, and the very few
 people hooked to some kind of comms net.

 The way I see it, it is NOT that awful that the government of the USA is
 trying (in its best tradition) to limit liberty and privacy through the
 implantation of mandatory 'crippled' encryption or 'key escrows' or
 secure-phones or what have you. Remember the good old theory of the shield
 and the sword. If there is no enemy, there is no battle, and if there's
 no battle, there's no point in hacking, anarchism, sabotage, and public
 opinion campaigns. If there's no threat to our freedom or privacy, our
 skills will decay, weaken, and we'll submit in the end to the exigences
 of those in power.

 Security in computer systems should be improved upon, so that hackers have
 to keep up to it. Anti-virus packages have to get better, so that virus
 makers develop new techniques. In the same way, threatened privacy in
 electronic communications will be an incentive for enterprising people
 to create new methods of avoiding eavesdropping, by the development of
 new, better and faster cryptographic algorithms.

 As long as we keep 'en garde', they can't beat us. They just can't. But
 if they leave us alone for a time, we'll grow in pride and self-confidence
 and a false sense of security, while they have time to re-arm. In that
 way, they'll have us in the end.

 Fight the power! (and be glad you need to)

                   SEX, THE INTERNET AND THE IDIOTS

 By K.K. Campbell (eye@io.org)

 There are two breeds of moron attracted to the Internet's relation to sex
 -- reporters and wankers. These categories may overlap, but that's beside
 the point.

 Canadian newsmedia owe a great deal of Internet education to Judge Francis
 Kovacs and his infamous Karla Homolka trial publication ban. That elevated
 the Internet to headline material. It is humorous to watch reporters/
 editors grope for net.literacy.

 Talk with Justin Wells (stem@sizone.pci.on.ca) and Ken Chasse
 (root@sizone.pci.on.ca), the chaps who created alt.fan.karla-homolka as a
 lark, then found themselves hounded by reporters asking for "banned
 information, please." Or check out The Star's early stories, where Usenet
 newsgroups are called "computer billboards" -- whatever the hell those are.

                             MEDIA MORONS

 Mainstream journalists without a rallying issue like a trial ban invariably
 end up with nothing better to do then bang the drum about the 3 Ps:
 pedophilia, piracy and pornography.

 Take the recent Internet "child molesters" silliness. Some teen somewhere
 is enticed into sex with an adult -- through America On Line, not the
 Internet -- and we have an "epidemic." Chicago's Harlan Wallach
 (wallach@mcs.com) reported in alt.internet.media-coverage how some dink
 named James Coates wrote a column for the July 15 Chicago Tribune called
 "Beware cybercreeps lurking on the Internet."  True enough. But Coates'
 purpose is to frighten the middle class with some probably made-up story
 about "Vito," who cruises the net hoping "to have sex with children in
 wheelchairs."

 I understand Coates' pain. I can't spend 10 minutes in Internet Relay Chat
 (IRC) before someone asks if I'm a child in a wheelchair looking for a sex
 partner. Wallach told eye Coates has been going like this for months now --
 "a master at work."

 Couple of weeks ago, California nuclear research facility Lawrence
 Livermore Labs discovered one computer held some dirty pictures. An employee
 gave away a password. Someone used that access to store the images. People
 could connect and get them. Nothing was hacked. Big deal.

 But on July 13, CNN reporter Don Knapp swooped in to whip up
 hysteria. Doom was clearly imminent.

 "Computer security specialists were surprised to find what may be the
 largest computer collection ever of hardcore pornography at the nation's
 top nuclear weapons and research laboratory," Knapp intoned ominously.
 Almost 2000 megs! Gol-ly! (Incidentally, 99 per cent of it was individual
 shots of nude/semi-nude women, no sexually explicit acts. Playboy stuff.)

 CNN rang Wired magazine writer Brian Behlendorf (brian@wired.com) and woke
 him at home, excited about "a big break-in at Laurence Livermore." Hackers
 and porno! If CNN was lucky, the hacker was a child molester. Behlendorf
 consented to an interview. CNN immediately asked him to "find some pictures
 of naked women on the Net for us." Behlendorf recounted the incident: "I
 really wasn't interested in doing that. I don't know of any FSP/FTP sites
 off hand anyways, and really didn't want to be associated with pictures of
 NEKKID GRRLS."*

 But amiable Behlendorf slid over to alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels and
 grabbed a picture of a model in a swimsuit. He also picked up a landscape,
 a race car and a Beatles album cover "to show that other images get sent
 over Usenet as  well," naively thinking this point would be made -- though
 he stresses he by no means condones distributing copyrighted images,
 "clean" or otherwise. Behlendorf was then made to sit beside a terminal
 displaying Ms String-Bikini throughout all his comments. "They made me keep
 returning to that  damn bikini image ... over and over."

 But intrepid reporter Don Knapp assured us all is well -- for now.
 "Spokespeople for the national laboratories insist that at no time were the
 pornographers, nor the software pirates, able to cross over from the
 research network into the classified network. The labs say that, while they
 are embarrassed, national security was not breached."

 Whew.

               YOU'RE GETTING VERY STUP- ERR, SLEEPY...

 Then you have regular net.wankers. Whoever said, "Never underestimate the
 intelligence of the American public," must read alt.sex.* newsgroups.

 For instance, the charismatic Aabid (aabid@elm.circa.ufl.edu) wrote a
 touching post called "I would like an enema myself!" to newsgroup sci.chem
 (science: chemistry). "Looking for a Middle Eastern M or F to help me with
 my enema desires. If you can be of assistance please email me." Readers of
 sci.chem were very intrigued and Aabid has made many interesting new
 friends.

 The greatest example of alt.sex stupidity is: The Hypnosis Program.

 As a joke, Indiana's Steve Salter (ssalter@silver.ucs.indiana.edu) posted to
 alt.sex.stories that he had a "hypnosis program" -- which you cleverly slip
 onto another person's computer where it will so mesmerize the unsuspecting
 target, he/she becomes your SEXUAL PLAYTHING, BENDING TO YOUR EVERY WHIM!
 For weeks after, global village idiots pestered him for copies.

 "I must have received over a hundred requests via private email or in
 alt.sex.stories for a copy of the program," Salter told eye. He had to
 publicly post a reply to stem the tide: "No offense, but get a rather
 large clue. There is no such animal. That was a joke. I thought it was
 obvious. How many people out there really want to hypnotize someone

 To get your own porn, there are lots of sites. Ask for the latest in
 the alt.sex groups. Check out alt.binaries.pictures.erotica to grab a
 few images. For text erotica, read in alt.sex.stories .

 If you can't access alt.sex groups because, say, your university is run by
 prudes, write (ahem) "Hot Stuff" (anon1ea3@nyx10.cs.du.edu) for details
 about his mail-server. He makes available hundreds of stories. We at eye
 have yet to sample this collection but are intrigued by two items: "Perils
 of Red Tape," which we assume reveals the lust-riddled world of civil
 service, and "Tales from the Network," the story of lonely boys sitting
 around Friday nights fingering their groins in IRC, praying someone with a
 female-sounding alias drops by.


 * FootNote: NEKKID GRRLS is idiomatic fresh-off-the-BBS net.wanker-

   like alt.2600 . To convince others you are a deadly cool net.cruiser,
   write: "HEY, elite pir-8 d00ds! I got more NEKKID GRRLS philes than
   ANY OF U!!!! And U censorship loosers can SUCK MY DICK!!!!!" Send it
   to alt.sex . Make sure to cross-post to the comp.sys.ibm.* hierarchy
   because PCs are the most common computer and you will reach a wider
   audience. If you can manage it, post through an anonymous account
   and leave your personal signature with real address in the text of
   the message.

                          JAUC For Windows Project
                       SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY RELEASE


 By Scott Davis (dfox@fc.net)

 The development team at Fennec Information systems is currently working on
 a project called "JAUC for Windows".  This software will be a large
 Windows-based help file with ALL the issues of The Journal Of American
 Underground Computing, Editor's page with tons of info on the editorial
 staff, as well as a LOT of other information regarding the Internet...
 all accessible with the click of a mouse in Windows. The scheduled release
 date for this piece of software is sometime in January. A furious effort
 is underway to provide you with this file as soon as possible. You will be
 required to have Windows 3.0, 3.1, or some other Windows-based product.
 It will work with Windows For Workgroups, NT, Chicago, Daytona, etc...
 The file will be available for FTP from TWO sites on the Internet. Those
 sites will more than likely be FC.NET and ETEXT.ARCHIVE.UMICH.EDU.
 You will be sent a small note (if you are on our mailing list) when this
 product becomes available. At this time, the only method of distribution
 is FTP. We are working on other ways to get this out. We will update you.
 If you have any questions regarding this product, please mail:

 jauc-win@fennec.com

 You will be mailed any updates automatically.

                        NBC's ANTI-NET CAMPAIGN

 By Alaric (Alaric@f111.n106.z1.fidonet.org)

 A most heinous act of info-terrorism has beem committed against the net
 community by "Dateline", NBC's pseudo-news propaganda ministry.

 To further the government's need to destroy the haven of free speech known
 as cyberspace, NBC has successfully deluded much of their reactionary
 brain-dead audience into beleiving that NETWORKS ARE DANGEROUS - BBS's ARE
 CRIMINAL.  Something must be done!  (Something will be done - read on...)

 The September 1 episode of Dateline paraded adventursome youths who had
 lost the occasional finger while honing their pyrotechnical skills with
 anarcho-terrorist data gleaned from BBSs and the net.  Forrest "Goebbels"
 Sawyer whined that the young and restless data-seekers of the 90's have easy
 access to exciting netware titles such as "Bomb Making For Fun and Profit"
 and "Anarchist's Cookbook" with no governmental interference of any kind!
 The existence of such networks and their accessibility by Gen-X misfits
 poses a clear and present danger to the national security of the United
 States.

 You may recall the first such attempt at an anti-net freedom propaganda
 campaign failed miserably and was aborted.  Not enough concerned citizens
 fell for the ruse of nets being an unfettered sanctuary for child porn
 mongers, NAMBLA dating services and wily molesters.  Since the first trial
 balloon was floated and quickly transpired, Plan-B has been put into action.
 Let's see how many suckers will fall for this one, "Computer networks are
 a dangerous source of subversive terrorist information and the children
 must be protected." (Janet Reno was conspicuously absent from said
 broadcast)

 A CongressMan-ic Oppresive named Ed Markey (Dem. Mass 7th Dist) is trying
 to hold hearings on the dangers of computer networking and supposedly try
 to draft some legislation that would allow the governmnet to regulate the
 nets or BBSs.  Undoubtedly the legislation if passed will have a chilling
 effect on net traffic, which frankly is getting way out of hand if you ask
 any bureaucrat with something to hide. Severe penalties will be brought
 against any sysop who allows minors to access anything that might be
 contrued as dangerous.  No doubt this definition will eventually receive
 a broad enough interpretation to forbid instructions on the manufacture of
 smoke bombs, casting of all lead ammunition, cleaning a .22 rifle, and even
 slingshot repair.  The true goal of such legislation of course is not to
 "protect the children", but to stifle the grassroots organizing of anti-
 statist groups and to squash the tide of truth that is flooding cyberspace
 and often embarrassing government and corporate interests.

 Look for a "Child Protection Act" subtitled "concerning minors' access to
 dangerous information" to come before Congress within 18 months.  Sysops
 will become responsible for what information gets to whom and what they do
 with it, regardless of the diligence they show in keeping the nets safe.
 Disclaimers and signed age statements will no longer suffice.  You WILL be
 responsible for the information travelling though your board or newsgroup
 and you WILL be held accountable.

 Is the Pen more Powerful than the Sword?  This question may never be
 answered fully, so why not hold on to both?  Yet the propaganda forces and
 strong arm tactics forces that managed to squeak by the ban on assault
 swords will now be unleashed on the modern-day pamphleteers of the net.
 Al Gore wants to build a kinder and gentler super-information tollroad to
 keep your pens in line.

 Netters will be able to mount a powerful counter-attack that will surprise
 the hell out of Big Brother and Little Rock Sister.  Notify Rep. Markey that
 we are watching and ready to fight.  Fax-blast his office.  Dig into his
 dirt and spread liberally.  Likewise show NBC that we are listening. Reach
 out and touch these folks as follows:

                  CYBERSPACE, MIAMI, CHAOS, AND CLINTON
                        THE MIAMI DEVICE PROJECT

 By Marty Cyber (cyb@gate.net)

 From December 8-11, 1994, Prez Clinton and Veep Gore, the Administration's
 point-man on the Infobahn will be coming to Miami to host the 35
 democratically elected heads of government of every country in the Western
 Hemisphere from Canada to Tierra del Fuego.

 The event is called the Summit of The Americas, and you folks who read Wired
 and ARE wired should plug into this event via the Internet and via any other
 bit-radiation-receiver-transmitter-device you have access too.  I'd like to
 get your ideas on how Cyberspace and Cybertech could help make the Summit a
 success from the point-of-view of telecomm and info-technologies --- in a
 word, to try to begin building and operating a Global Brain and Nervous
 System for Planet Earth that can help us all in private, public, academic
 and community sectors use Cyberspace to create some kind of movement toward
 a New World Order out of the Chaos and Complexity we are now trying to surf
 on, without a truly functional "cybersurfboard."

 I'm attaching a couple of files that could stimulate some interesting
 exchanges --- and hoping to get the likes of Negroponte, Kelly, Kapor,
 Fields, Minsky, Schank, Bruckman, Clinton, Gore, Mesarovich, Forrester,
 Shannon, Wiener, Prigogine, Crowley, Castro, Mas Canosa, Irving,
 Brown, Chiles, Cuomo, Tyson, Simon, Beer, Gleick, --- and YOU ---
 to all kick in some ideas on how to use the Miami Summit as a kickoff
 environment for launching a World Summit on The Future via Cyberspace.


 Do give me some "negative feedback," as the cyberneticians have been known
 to say.

 And if any of you would like to warm your cybernetic buns in Miami in
 December --- real buns or virtual buns --- give me some "bit-radiations."
 I've got an Art Deco apartment building in the heart of Miami Beach's
 cyberhip South Beach, and might be able to put you up.

 Clinton's awareness of, and ability to use, the Principles of Chaos,
 Complexity, Cybernetics and other modern organizational management and
 learning techniques may be decisive in determining if his Administration
 is able to create a New World Order on the Edge of the Current Turbulent
 ORDER/CHAOS Meridian.

 Unfortunately, day-to-day decisiomaking and policy selection in the White
 House frequently has so much noise injected on its channels from Whitewater,
 Senator Damato-type ignoramus-based partisan-politics, that serious policy
 problems like Cuba, and other Foreign, Domestic and Economic matters tend
 toward more chaotic and less orderly states.

 What the White House could use --- perhaps initially placed within its
 Office of Science and Technology Policy --- is a National Cybernetics
 Council.  This group would consist of the nation and the world's specialists
 in Complex Systems Theory, Chaos, Cybernetics, Cyberspace, and a new field
 which integrates all of the above: CYBERTECTURE: The design, construction,
 and operation of "cybernetic systems" for government, business, education
 and city-planning.

 Pete Nelson is correct in suggesting that we need politicians and polities
 that can "embrace change, uncertainty, paradox and contradiction," but we
 also must equip the public, private, academic and community sectors of
 American (and World) Society to deal with this new level of complexity.

 In December, if current White House plans stay in place, President Clinton
 and VP Al Gore, Clinton's point-man in advancing his Administration's high-
 level policy objective of building a National and Global Information
 Infrastructure (NII/GII) --- the highly publicized "Information Superhighway"
 --- both of American Government's top-managers will travel to Miami to host
 the Summit of The Americas December 8-11, 1994.

 Although the primary agenda topics for all the invited democratically elected
 leaders of every coutry in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to the southern
 tip of Latin America will be Economic Integration, Democratic Political
 Systems, and extending NAFTA into WHFTA (a Western Hemisperhic Free Trade
 Agreement), and important sub-topic will be infrastructure -- especially
 Telecommunications and Information Infratructure.

 With "the Cybertecture of Cybersystems, policy makers and their politiescan
 steer through the current chaotic turbulences of today into a new, and
 hopefully better, world order of tomorrow.

 Clinton and Gore, with the proper cybertools, may be just what the world
 needs now.  Our non-profit consulting partnership in Miami Beach, "The MIAMI
 DEVICE PROJECT/RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP, has developed a concept-
 paper for this December Summit of the Americas that could help Clinton, and
 the rest of use, develop and use the cybersystems we need to steer into our
 21st Century Future.

 The following text is a summary of our first draft of the Miami Device
 Project concept.  We'd appreciate your feedback, comments, critiques, and
 suggestions on how to create a World Summit on The Future during December
 1994 and January 1995 on the Internet and other related media such as print,
 broadcast, multimedia, and face-to-face conferences.  Also broadening the
 audiences for the work of the Santa Fe Institute, Bill Gleick, Ilya
 Prigogine, Mitchell Waldrop, and the other leading theorists and
 practitioners of Chaos/Complexity theory, and related researchers in
 Cybernetics and Management of Large Organizations, such as Barry Clemson,
 Jay Forrester, Stafford Beer, Mike Mesarovic, and the related work at US
 Government Research Labs as well as the great industrial research labs at
 IBM and ATT, could also bring the power of science to the problems of public
 policy and decision-making.


                    THE MIAMI DEVICE PROJECT:
             AN AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL MISSION-QUEST
                        FOR CYBERSPACE

 Something important, chaotic and with a hidden sense of latent order is
 happening in Cyberspace and Real-Space.

 Nobody who is honest can say they truly know, see, can predict or control
 what is happening  with The Net, also known as:

 THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY.
 THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
 THE GLOBAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
 THE INFO BAHN.
 THE ELECTRONIC/DIGITAL SUPERHIGHWAY.
 CYBERSPACE.

 America and The World need models, mavens, moxie, methodologies and, last
 but not least, money --- to design, build, test, market and operate the
 National and Global Information Infrastructures.  But most of all, the
 emerging Cyberspace Industry will need multimedia forums and discourse,
 even face-to-face conferences, that will clarify and shape the complex and
 relevant issues we must deal with as we enter the on-ramps to the Info
 Superhighway, and try to avoid the "road-kills" of entities both corporate
 and ideational that took the wrong turns.  These forums and discourses may
 turn out to be the second most important set of discussions since the
 founding of the United States in 1776 in the shaping and shaping of America
 and the World as we approach the 21st Century.  Adding to the complexity
 of the discussions about Cybernetic-Cyberspace technologies, applications
 and markets will be the fact that we will be using these ver same networks
 to discuss and develop their evolution  ---- hopefully a democratic exchange
 of views from the many stakeholders and users of the Net who will design and
 live in the rapidly evolving civilization, societies and communities
 (virtual and real) that will be spawned by CyberTech, and the cultural,
 economic, political and community structures Cyberspace will enable.

 Cyberspace represents a new and irresistible era in the evolution of human
 culture and business under the sign of technology --- but what is turyly
 wonderful is that we still have the opportunity to shape the application of
 Cybertech toward an Age of Utopia rather than Dystopia.

 What is being born and can be shaped by discussion and effort is something
 that every normal child or animal possesses at birth, but has never fully
 existed intact over the entire face of the planet:

 A BRAIN FOR PLANET EARTH; A GLOBAL CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM;
 A WORLD-WIDE SENSE AND PARTICIPATION IN A GLOBAL COMMUNITY;
 A CYBERNETIC CITY.

 The relevant discourses and forums must rationally and humanely deal with
 all the relevant issues connected with the new cybertechnologies and
 cybermedia --- and they are too important to the future of the planet to be
 left in the hands of government, business or universities alone.  The
 community and the public but get informed and stay involved with the
 evolution of  the Net.

 We have termed this multi-dimensional quest and process

 THE MIAMI DEVICE PROJECT TOWARD PARADISE REGAINED ---
 FOR GREATER MIAMI BEACH, SOUTH FLORIDA, AND THE
 WORLD-CLASS CITIES, CITIZENS, & NATIONS OF THE FUTURE.

 Why Miami?  Why not Cambridge, or New York, or Chicago, or Los Angeles,
 or Milan, or Berlin or Paris London or Tokyo?

 In the history of the planet over the ages, from the time humankind first
 emerged from the primordial ooze, there have always been a succession of
 great city-regions that entered the world stage as truly world-class,
 international and cosmopolitan centers of trade, culture, education,
 technolgy, finance, transportation, and concentration of talent, dreams,
 wheels and deals.

 Just as the Central Florida region around Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy
 Space Center identified itself as America and the World's launch-pad and
 testbed for Aerospace, so is the Greater Miami Beach and South Florida
 region of the Sunshine State begun it movement toward center-stage as the
 nation and the planet's laboratory and test-bed for mankind's thrust into
 the truly Final and Next Frontier: Cyberspace.

 The Greater Miami Beach/South Florida region of 4 million, supported by a
 unique partnership of its private, public, academic and community sectors
 called The Miami Device Project, has been selected by the Clinton
 Administration to host in our region in December of 1994 the first, Western
 Hemisphere-Latin American Summit Conference, to be led by President
 Clinton and Vice-President Gore themselves.

 Greater Miami Beach's strategic geographic location and tropical, earthquake-
 free (though occasionally hurricane-prone) has positioned the region as an
 international gateway to not only Latin America and The Caribbean, but to
 Europe, Asia, and North America, also.  A great airport .... the world's
 largest cruise-ship port and one of the most active seaports ... and coming
 soon, the world's first Cyberport-Teleport-Cyberspaceport ... a laboratory
 and crucible where the model Cybernetic City of The Future will be forged.

 Greater Miami Beach and it's multimedia links and partnerships with other
 sister cities, states, and nations intends to do for the science, art and
 business of cybernetic computer communications something similar, but much
 more benevolent for humanity, what the Manhattan Project did during World
 War II with the technology of thermonuclear energy, from which the atomic
 bomb was created.

 BUT THERE WILL BE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN MISSION AND VISION IN THE MIAMI
 DEVICE PROJECT AS OPPOSED TO THE MANHATTAN PROJECT:  The Miami Device
 Project's focus is to create and to provide universal access to knowledge
 tools and multimedia information systems for the human community, in both
 America and world-wide --- and to help design, build and sustain a truly
 Global Village and Cybernetic City where art, science, philosophy,
 technology and business can provide the human spirit with the lift of a
 driving dream into the 21st Century --- a Cybernetic Century of peace,
 prosperity and co-evolution for man, his systems, and our children.


 Norbert Wiener, the MIT professor of mathematics and inventor of the word
 and field of cybernetics, once commented in his book, "cybernetics and
 Society: the Human Use of Human Beings:" Mankind and society can only be
 truly understood by a study of the messages they transmit; in the future,
 messages between man and man, man and machine, and machine and machine
 will play an increasingly important role."

 If children can be considered messages we send to a future we may never see
 ourselves, the human children of our loins will themselves create new
 futures with the children of our minds --- our systems, networks and
 knowledge bases --- as humanity leaps toward the stars in our inner and
 outer universes.

 SUGGESTED INTERNET COMMERCIAL SPEECH GUIDELINES

 Explanatory Preface

 The Internet is the most powerful communication tool in the world, today
 and for the forseeable future. Recently the circulation of an advertisement
 by two lawyers for their legal services raised tremendous controversy as to
 the manner and location that ads should be placed on the Internet.

 Two years ago the National Science Foundation lifted the ban on Internet
 advertisements that they had previously imposed. Yet, the idea of
 commercialism an advertising in this increasingly pervasive medium is still
 controversial. The primary anti-ad forces can be found among the academics
 and technical workers who were the early residents of the Internet. Where
 advertising is an integral part of other mediums, this highly vocal faction
 is attempting, not without some success, publicly to characterize
 advertisers as inferior to others who supply information via computer.

 While the ad critics do not speak with a single voice, but rather express a
 diversity of opinions, several elements emerge with some consistency.
 First, there is an overall presumption that advertising is unwanted and
 useless.  Even though those who who have made the pioneering forays into
 Internet advertising have met with financial  success (proving that
 advertising messages are indeed accepted) the vocal minority continues to
 insist otherwise. Based on this faulty premises advertisers are told that
 custom demands that they approach customers only in an indirect manner.
 Specifically, advertisers are told that it is apropriate to to places ads
 only on channels set aside to carry nothing but advertising. Alternatively,
 an advertiser may place a message at a fixed locale in cyberspace but must
 use other mediums such as billboards and television ads to announce the
 computer location and ask the customer to go and look for it.

 It is unanimously agreed that noone controls the Internet and there is no
 legal requirment to follow these dictates. Nevertheless the vocal Internet
 minority that custom requires adherence to its outdated philospophy.

 The guidlines presented here refuse to recognize the unreasonable nature of
 those who are anti-advertising, Commercial activity on the Internet is a
 valuable and worthwhile use of this resource and advertising is a key
 element of such commercial use. It should be recognized that virtually no
 busines can be successful without advertising. The old-think view of some
 Net extremists that advertising is as an unwanted an unpleasant annoyance
 to be marginally tolerated is not good for the development of the Internet,
 nor healthy for the World economy.

 Recently special groups and networks devoted exclusively to product and
 service promotion have begun to be established. While these are an exciting
 pert of the development of the Information Superhighway, it is not
 acceptable or practical for advertising to be kept in a restricted area,
 separate from other Internet activities. Advertising is not relegated to
 such an inferior position in any other medium, thus it should not be so
 with respect to the Internet.

 Neither those who advertise on the Internet be forced to do so passively.
 In no ther medium is it required that a potential customer deliberately
 seek out an advertisement rather than having it placed before him or her.
 The idea that the only acceptable way to advertise on the Internet is a
 system where a non-computer medium is utilized to request that a potential
 customer look for such information at a particular site in cyberspace is a
 totally unacceptable limitation. Such convoluted methods are not effective
 or convenient for the advertiser or the consumer.

 The easy, free flow of information is the goal of the Internet. Advertising
 is valuable and useful information. It is the concept of free flow that
 should govern any Internet advertising policy.

 GUIDELINES

 * Usenet
 It is recognized that the Usenet is only public gathering place currently
 existing on the Internet. It is a legal and appropriate forum in which to
 place commercial messages.

 * Distribution
 Distribution of advertising messages to newsgroups on the Usenet will be
 based upon the demographic and /or interst of users of the newsgroups,
 ensuring that the newsgroups selected are those most often used by people
 likely to be interested in a particular commercial message.

 * Identity
 All commercial messages should be readiliy identifiable so users can read
 them in a fully informed manner. For example, a conventional, easily
 recognizable "AD" identifier in the title of all commercial message
 offerings may serve this purpose.

 * Filtering
 Advertisers shall respect the right of all individual Internet users to,
 though the use of existing or evolving technology, filter out commercial
 messages if they so choose. However, any upsteam provider short of the end
 users should refrain from making that decision for the individual, who may
 welcome a particular commercial message. Anything else would amount to
 censorship.

 * Sincerity
 Commercial messages should be offered only when there is a sincere belief
 that the information will prove useful to Internet users. The inclusion of
 useful information with the advertising copy is encouraged. However, it is
 als recognized that solicitation of purchases and directions on how to make
 such purchases are a validethical pursuit of the advertiser, as well as a
 useful convenience fot the consumer.

 (In addition to the above Internet-specific guidelines, the following
 suggestions are based upon time-tested, proven codes already in existence.
 {Sources are cited with each entry})

 * Truth
 Advertising shall tell the truth and shall reveal significant facts, the
 concealment of which would mislead the public (AAF's Advertising Principle
 of American Business)

 * Responsibility
 Advertising agencies and advertisers shall be willing to provide
 substantiation of all claims made (WSJ Guide to Advertising Policy and
 Production)

 * Taste and Decency
 Advertising shall be free of statements, illustrations, or implications
 that are offensive to good taste or public decency (Same Source)

 * Substantiation
 Advertising claims shall be substantiated by evidence in possession of the
 advertiser and advertising agency, prior to making such claims.
 (Advertising Principles of American Business)

 * Omission
 An advertisement as a whole (ed. note: original says "shoe") may be
 misleading although every sentence separately considered is literally true.
 Misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but from
 omission of material facts (Better Business Bureau Code of Advertising)

 * Testimonials
 Advertising containing testimonials shall be limited to those of competent
 witnesses who are reflecting a real and honest opinion or experience.
 (Advertising Principles of American Business)

 * Composition
 The composition and layout of advertisements should be such as to minimize
 the possibility of misundertanding. (BBB Code)

 * Price Claims
 Advertisers shall not knowingly create advertising that contains price
 claims which are misleading. (AAAA Standards and Practices)

 * Unprovable Claims
 Advertising shall avoid the use of exaggerated or uprovable claims. (WSJ
 Guide)

 * Claims by Authorities
 Advertisers will not knowingly create advertising that contains claims
 insufficiently supported or that distorts the true meaning or practical
 application of statements made by professional or scientific authority.
 (Standards and Practices)

 * Guarantees and Warranties
 Advertiser of such shall be explicit with sufficient information to apprise
 consumers of their principal terms and limitations, or, when space and time
 restrictions pleclude such disclosures, the advertisement shall clearly
 reveal where the full text of the guarantee or warranty can be examined
 before purchase. (Advertising Principles)

 * Bait Advertising
 Advertising shall not offer products or services for sale unless such offer
 is constitutes a bona fide effort to sell the advertised products or
 services and is not a device to switch consumers to other goods or
 services, usually higher price. (Same Source)

  Queries from nslookup asking for an IP address or MX record for
  sell.com yield no fruit.  The query "ls sell.com" is refused by the PSI
  name servers.

  But it seems logical to ask about "cyber.sell.com", and sure enough,
  it's there:

  cyber.sell.com inet address = 199.98.145.99 cyber.sell.com preference =
  5, mail exchanger = cyber.sell.com

  This is the same address that pericles.com had until a couple of days
  ago.  It still has no backup mail exchanger, but that may not be so
  important any more, because....

  The host at this address is no longer a PC running Microsoft Windows.
  It's now a Unix box!  That's right: if you try to telnet to this host,
  at the customary port 23, you're greeted with this prompt:

  UNIX System V Release 4.2 (cybersell) (pts/0)

  login:

  There are also server processes listening on ports 512(rexecd), 513
  (rlogind) and 514 (rshd).

  They've got an FTP server (port 21), but it doesn't accept "anonymous"
  or "ftp" as a user name.

  They've also got an SMTP server listening (port 25), but it apparently
  does not implement the "vrfy", "expn", or "help" commands--all of these
  yield "502 ... Not recognized" error replies.  The "rcpt to" command
  seems to accept any recipient name as legitimate--any validity check
  must come later, after it has already accepted the mail.

  They don't have an NNTP(119), Gopher(70), or Web(80) server--at least
  not on the conventional ports for such services.

  They do have a few other active ports: echo(7), discard(9),
  daytime(13), ttytest(19), and time service (37).

  There's also something that answers a connection to port 199, but I
  have no idea what that service might be.  Anyone else know?

  If you do a traceroute, you get this: ....  9 psi-nsf.psi.net
  (192.41.177.246) 27 ms 31 ms 27 ms 10 core.net155.psi.net (38.1.2.3)
  145 ms 129 ms 145 ms 11 serial.phoenix.az.psi.net (38.1.10.37) 227 ms
  195 ms 195 ms 12 38.2.37.6 (38.2.37.6) 230 ms 184 ms 238 ms 13
  cyber.sell.com (199.98.145.99) 195 ms 215 ms 219 ms

  Someone who knows more about routing and networks than me might be able
  to analyze this for information about the nature of their connection.
  What is "38.2.37.6"?  It has no hostname, and if you try to telnet to
  it, it asks for a password without first asking for a username.

  I hope all of the above information is useful to the rest of the Usenet
  community.  If you've got your site aliased to "pericles.com", you
  should consider adding a new alias of "cyber.sell.com".  I look forward
  to hearing more information from others more knowledgeable than myself.

 For a bunch folks wanting to rule the info highway, cable's status on the
 Internet echoes MTV:Unplugged. There are some signs of senior execs
 starting to tap in, but they're few and far between. There are domains
 listed in the name of cable companies (TCI, Cablevision Systems, Viacom)
 but many seem to be inactive. Comcast and Viacom are on hopelessly limited
 MCI Mail systems that regularly snarl. To steal a line, cable execs hope to
 build the highway but they can't drive.

 Example: Recently I needed a copy of the freshly revised Hollings bill
 S.1822. I couldn't get it out of the Senate, the National Cable Television
 Association or any cable source. But I surfed over to Bell Atlantic's
 Internet site (ba.com) and grabbed the whole thing (including amendments).
 The telcos are clearly hipper to this info highway stuff than the cable
 kids.

 The good news is that the number of Internet resources useful to cable
 professionals is growing. The bad news is that they're primarily provided
 by telcos and regulators. But it's a start. Here's a cluster of cable
 resources of all sorts that I've encountered.

 GIMME FEEDBACK! Send us updates, particularly on the technical side. (And
 not just how to pirate HBO and pay-per-view porno, please.)

 "Differently clued" cable newbies should feel free to contact us with any
 questions on how to navigate. Many of these resources are NOT accessible to
 subscribers of Prodigy, America On-Line and Compu$erve.

 A similar list of broadcasting resources on the net is compiled by Neil
 Griffin (ngriffin@nyx.cs.du.edu).

 ** Mailing Lists

 TELECOMREG: A mailing list focusing on telecomunications regulation.
 Subscribers got an early peek at the FCC's latest cable price formula,
 Founded by Barry Orton, a consultant to municipal regulators, TELECOMREG is
 very high volume and fairly high quality.
 How to get on it: E-mail (listserver@relay.adp.wisc.edu; SUBSCRIBE
 TELCOMREG YOUR NAME)

 SCTE-LIST: A mailing list on cable technology apparently tied to the
 Society of Cable Television Engineers that just cranked up. It's too new to
 judge the quality.
 How to get on it: E-mail (listserver@relay.adp.wisc.edu; SUBSCRIBE
 SCTE-LIST YOUR NAME)

 I-TV: Discussion list centered on two-way Interactive Television. Very
 new, and appears to be focusing mostly on education and community
 development. So far it's pretty lame, but that could change. Expect lots
 of public-access types to be kicking around, as opposed to folks actually
 trying to make a business of it. Uploading press releases is -- for some
 bizzare reason -- encouraged.
 How to get on it: E-Mail (listserv@knowledgework.com; SUB I-TV YOUR
 NAME).

 TELECOM DIGEST: Oriented toward voice telephony, but covers all sorts of
 telecommunications topics. Fairly techie.
 How to get on it: E-mail (telecom-request@eecs.nwu.edu; SUBSCRIBE
 YOUR@ADDRESS); Usenet (comp.dcom.telecom).

 ** Publications

 CABLE REGULATION DIGEST: A weekly summary of regulatory news from
 Multichannel News. The best way to obtain it each week is on the TELECOMREG
 list.
 How to get it: FTP (ftp.vortex.com: /tv-film-video/cable-reg)
 Gopher (gopher.vortex.com : /TV/Film/Video)

 FCC DAILY DIGEST: Washington telecom lawyer Robert Keller attaches the
 most recent edition and referenced documents to his "finger" file. A really
 nice effort by Keller. Be sure to open your capture buffer first, as the
 file is many screens long.
 Also available at the fcc.gov ftp and gopher site. (see below).
 How To Get It: Finger (finger rjk@telcomlaw.com).

 EDUPAGE: Tip sheet on information technology and media issued three
 times weekly. Quickie summaries primarily of newspaper articles,

 newspapers, but also includes some full-text reprints.
 How to get it: E-mail (shoptalk-request@gremlin.clark.net, SUBSCRIBE

 Euro cable and satellite television scene. Concentrates on BSkyB but also
 romps off onto the continent.
 How to get it: E-mail (bignoise@cix.compulink.co.uk), Usenet {preferred!}
 (alt.satellite.tv.europe).

 SATNEWS: A newsletter about satellite television broadcasting around the
 world.
 How to get it: E-mail: (listserv@orbital.demon.co.uk, SUBSCRIBE YOUR
 NAME).

 ** FTP, Gopher, and WWW Sites

 CABLELABS: Finally, a cable-specific document archive! CableLabs, the
 industry's R&D greenhouse, has established an anonymous FTP archive at
 cablelabs.com. It's still "under construction", as they say. There's a
 small collection of techie documents in it so far, but more is promised.
 How to get there: FTP (ftp.cablelabs.com); WWW (http://www.cablelabs.com/).

 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMISSION: Loads of documents, orders, etc. but
 they're poorly orgainized.
 How to get there: Gopher (fcc.gov); FTP (fcc.gov).

 PEPPER & CORAZZINI: A D.C. telecom law firm has put up an archive of
 documents and memos by their lawyers on related to broadcasting, cable,
 common carriers, PCS and information law. P&C's e-mail contact is Neal J.
 Friedman (nfriedma@clark.net)
 How to get there: Gopher (gopher.iis.com//11/p-and-c); FTP
 (ftp.iis.com/companies/p-and-c) WWW (http://www.iis.com/pandc-home.html).

 NTIA: National Telecommunications and Information Administration has a
 document site, notably from Clinton's National Info Infrastructure
 committe. Seems to be down frequently.
 How to get there: Gopher (ntia.doc.gov); FTP (ntia.doc.gov).

 BELL ATLANTIC: Telco propaganda (press releases, speeches, Congressional
 testimony) mixed in with lots of useful regulatory documents.
 How to get there: Gopher (ba.com); FTP (ba.com).

 MFJ TASK FORCE: More RBOC lobbying on-line. But it's a hell of a lot
 better than anything cable has to offer.
 How to get there: Gopher (bell.com).

 C-SPAN: The public-affairs network has a gopher site with a whole mess of
 programming info for viewers.
 How to get there: Gopher (c-span.org); ftp (c-span.org).

 CNN: For reasons I haven't quite figured out, the University of Maryland
 has a gopher site carrying the text of CNN's Headline News stories, putting
 up dozens of national and international news stories daily, with an archive
 going back several days.
 How to get there: Gopher (info.umd.edu).

 ** Usenet Groups

 The quality of cable info on Usenet newgroups is mixed. The most active
 cable group is rec.video.cable-tv. It once was dominated by tips on
 stealing cable. However, in recent months three cable system-level execs
 from Time Warner (Dean Stauffer), Continental (Scott Westerman) and Century
 (Lloyd Sanchez) have virtually turned the group around by patiently and
 respectfully responding to cable subscribers' questions, legit complaints
 and outright rants. Informed and informative answers, what a concept! Give
 them a raise.

 Usenet is one way to sample what subscribers are buzzing about. Is your
 company included on the recent list of "worst cable companies"?

 rec.video.cable-tv        Most active.
 alt.cable-tv.re-regulate  Traffic has really picked up. Lots of
                           complaining subscribers.
 alt.satellite.tv.europe   Active group on Euro cable and satellite
                           programming.
 alt.politics.datahighway  Not too bad.
 alt.tv.public-access      Reportedly exists, but I've never seen it.
 comp.dcom.telecom         Moderated discussion of telco issues. Telecom
                           Digest appears here.
 alt.dcom.telecom          Breakaway group started by telco folks
                           irritated by the ones dominating
                           comp.dcom.telecom
 alt.dcom.catv             I've NEVER seen pertinent traffic on this group.
 alt.tv.comedy.central     Dull.
 alt.tv.mst3k              Comedy Central's Mystery Science Theater 3000.
 alt.tv.hbo                Hardly any traffic.
 alt.tv.nickelodeon        Fans of the kid's network.
 alt.fan.ren-and-stimpy    'Nuff said.

 ** FAQ's

 There's a few frequently-asked-questions lists kicking about. The Cable
 TV FAQ is all about pirating HBO (YAWN!), with many technical details.
 Can't find the archive site, however. The DBS and wireless cable FAQs are
 more useful to non-pirate professionals.

 All three are posted are posted in rec.video.cable-tv periodically. High-
 power DBS is in rec.video.satellite. I'll add archive sites as I find them.

                                THE MEDIA LIST

 By Adam M. Gaffin (adamg@world.std.com)

 This is a listing of newspapers, magazines, TV stations and other media
 outlets that accept electronic submissions from readers and viewers, along
 with their main e-mail addresses.  It would be almost impossible to
 maintain a listing of individual reporters, editors and the like;  if you
 want to reach a specific person, try sending a request to the given media
 outlet's general address (but see below for a one-time listing for the
 Ottawa Citizen).  If you are submitting a letter to the editor or an op-ed
 piece, it's a good idea to include your mail address and a daytime phone
 number.  Publications generally try to verify authorship and will not run
 submissions without some way to check whether you really wrote the item
 to which your name is attached.

 Please send any additions, deletions or corrections to the address at the
 end of this list.  Look for new editions in the alt.journalism,
 alt.internet.services and comp.misc newsgroups.  My thanks to all who have
 contributed!  Because of these kind folks, this list is now substantially
 longer than it was just a week ago.

 SPECIAL NOTE:  The last part of this list contains the e-mail addresses
 for reporters and editors at the Ottawa Citizen.  Thanks to the Citizen for
 the information.

 What follows are new entries and corrections for the Media List, which is
 a listing of newspapers, radio stations, etc. that accept electronic
 submissions. This is NOT the complete list.  You can obtain the entire
 list via ftp at ftp.std.com as customers/periodicals/Middlesex-
 News/medialist. If you'd rather receive the list and updates automatically
 via e-mail, write to

 NOTES ON USING THIS LIST: If you want a publication to print your letter,
 include your postal address and phone number for verification purposes.
 Also, please consider NOT using this list to send a mass mailing to every
 single listed media outlet. A bicycling magazine is unlikely to be
 interested in your thoughts on abortion, no matter how cogent they are,
 for example.

 My thanks again to all who have contributed!  Comments and suggestions --
 and especially addresses of unlisted media organizations -- are most
 welcome.  Please send them to adamg@world.std.com (please note the 'g' in
 adamg; adam@world.std.com is a very nice person who has been graciously
 forwarding mis-addressed e-mail, but he is not me).

 NEWSFLASH:  The New York Times is planning a formal Internet connection,
 we read on the CARR-L mailing list, sometime this summer or early fall.
 Once in place, the domain will be nytimes.com. CARR-L is a list for
 talking about the use of computers in newsrooms and journalistic research.
 To subscribe, send e-mail to listserv@ulkyvm.bitnet.  Leave the "subject:"
line blank, and as your message, write: subscribe carr-l Your Name

 Pre-Conference Tutorial
 UNDERSTANDING INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES
 FOR NON-ENGINEERS AND STRATEGIC PLANNERS
 Monday, October 10, 1994  - 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

 Presented By: John Curran, BBN Technology Services;
 Bruce Antleman, Information Express;
 Bruce Caslow, Mesa Technologies; and Stephen Crocker,
 Trusted Information Systems, Inc.

 This one-day tutorial is for the non-engineer, strategic planner,
 entrepreneur or anyone who has to understand the Internet in order to make
 business decisions about emerging commercial opportunities. This tutorial
 covers not only Internet technologies, economics and leading-edge
 opportunities, but also looks at operational issues such as security,
 addressing and network management from a business development perspective.

 1. INTERNET OVERVIEW: What is the Internet? Who controls it? How do you get
 connected? What can you do with it? Who pays for it? Who are the players
 domestically and internationally? What is the role of the NII and NREN? Why
 are the RBOCs, cable TV companies, IXCs and PDA vendors interested in
 Internet? Why all the attention to commercialization? How is the Internet
 likely to evolve over the next few years?

 2. INTERNET ACCESS, NAVIGATION AND APPLICATIONS:
 How to find, share and sell information on the Internet. The basic
 application tools and navigation/search systems (FTP, Telnet, Archie, Gopher,
 Mosaic, World Wide Web, WAIS, etc.). Access service providers (CIX, PSI,
 Sprint and others). Access options (dial-up, dedicated, frame relay, cable
 TV and wireless).New entrepreneurial developments.

 3. INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES: Role of TCP/IP. MAC vs. PC products. LAN access

 Paglia: Brash, Self-Promoting and Possibly the next Marshall McLuhan

 Interviewed by Stewart Brand

 (Editor's note - Paglia's faxed corrections of this article became a
 critical part of the design and layout. Hence, it has lost much that
 cannot be conveyed in ASCII over the electronic BBS's or the Internet. We
 strongly suggest you refer to the original in the magazine itself for the
 complete context).

 Camille Paglia, bad girl of feminism, has a knack for outraging listeners
 one moment, and then having them nod their heads in agreement the next. In
 rapid-fire broadcast mode, Paglia jumps from Aristotle to Madonna, soap
 opera to cathedral, all in one sentence. A tape recorder has trouble
 picking out her cascading words (Paglia faxed the accompanying text
 corrections to WIRED's offices late one Saturday night) and makes
 absolutely no progress in capturing her total body animation as she acts
 out each phrase. A media creature through and through, Paglia has been
 cavorting in the limelight of network TV and sold-out lectures ever since
 her 1991 book, Sexual Personae (the first of two volumes), poked the eye
 of both conservatives and liberals. Intrigued by Paglia's intellectual
 resemblance to Marshall McLuhan - patron saint of WIRED magazine - Stewart
 Brand, the author of the Media Lab, caught up with Paglia in the court of
 a San Francisco hotel.

 BRAND: Have you mapped your success against Marshall McLuhan's? Remember
 how that happened? Here was a guy, like you he was on the fringe of
 academia, Catholic oriented, basically a literary creature. He starts
 holding forth in a epigrammatic way about culture and media, and suddenly
 AT&T and everybody else wants to talk to him. Paglia comes along, does
 what you've done...

 PAGLIA: ...Influenced by McLuhan. Neil Postman, who I had the Harper's
 magazine discussion with, said something that was very moving to me. He
 said at the end of that evening, "I was a student of Marshall McLuhan and
 I have never been with someone who reminded me more of McLuhan. When you
 were sitting with McLuhan in the middle of the night, all you would see
 was the tip of his cigar glowing, and you would hear him making these huge
 juxtapositions. Even his writing never captured the way McLuhan's mind
 worked. Your mind works exactly the same, the way you bring things
 together and they ssssizzle when you bring them together."

 BRAND: So you read McLuhan in college.

 PAGLIA: McLuhan was assigned in my classes. Everyone had a copy of his
 books. There were so many things that were happening at that moment -
 McLuhan, Norman O. Brown, Leslie Fiedler, Allen Ginsberg. There was
 enormous promise of something that was going to just blast everything open
 in cultural criticism. What the heck happened? It wasn't just a
 conservative administration in the '70s and '80s. That's not it. It was a
 failure on the part of the '60s generation itself. You feel it a little
 bit in "Blow Up," or just like reading about Jimi Hendrix and the way the
 women looked, the way the groupies looked - how fabulous the groupies
 were. They were so sexy and so ballsy! It was amazing how those '60s
 chicks talked. This was the real feminism. Even women got less powerful.
 We have had a general cultural collapse.

 BRAND: What did you make of McLuhan?

 PAGLIA: We all thought, "This is one of the great prophets of our time."
 What's happened to him? Why are these people reading Lacan or Foucault who
 have no awareness at all of mass media? Why would anyone go on about the
 school of Saussure? In none of that French crap is there any reference to
 media. Our culture is a pop culture. Americans are the ones who have to be
 interpreting the pop culture reality.

 When I was in England earlier this summer for the release of the Penguin
 paperback of Sexual Personae, I was having fits because of no TV there. I
 felt like I was in prison. Then I got to Amsterdam, and Amsterdam was
 better because they had everything on satellite. That was interesting in a
 kind of sociological way. They have German TV and Italian TV and French
 TV, but it is still not equivalent to what we have. What we have is total
 domination by the pop culture matrix, by the mass media matrix. That's the
 future of the world.

 BRAND: Is pop culture and mass media the same thing?

 PAGLIA: For me, yes. I teach a course called "Mass Media." I think that it
 should be required for every liberal arts graduate - the whole history of
 mass media, traced from the 1830s newspapers all the way to today.

 BRAND: Between Volume 1 and the forthcoming Volume 2 of Sexual Personae is
 the arrival of mass media. When you have mass media, is art different?

 PAGLIA: I call the 20th century "The Age of Hollywood." I believe that
 mass media and pop culture is the culture of the 20th century. There's a
 big break at World War II. The last great works of high art are with World
 War I. You have Picasso and T. S. Eliot, and I feel that modernism in
 literature exhausted itself in its first generation - Proust, Joyce,
 Wolfe; that was it. What else? That's why I have my provocative
 statements, such as for me the best novel after World War II is Auntie
 Mame. I mean that literally. The only writers of fiction interesting to me
 at all after World War II are decadent or comedic. These are to me the
 only modes that work literarily after World War II. So Genet and Tennessee
 Williams are major figures for me.

 My publisher is always trying to get me to read novels - Saul Bellow, A.S.
 Byatt. I say, "Why would I want to read a serious novel?" Because a
 serious novel today is already too reactionary, by trying to reinterpret
 contemporary reality in verbal terms, making a verbal structure - no, no,
 no. To me, the rhythms of our thinking in the pop culture world, the
 domination by image, the whole way the images are put together, and so on
 are way beyond the novel at this point. If a novelist does emerge now who
 is a product of pop culture and mass media, it's going to look quite
 different on the page. It won't necessarily look fragmented. I don't
 believe in that post-modernist thing of cutting things up. But the rhythms
 of it are going to be fast rhythms, and it's going to be surreal, flashing.

 In my famous encounter with Susan Sontag in 1973, I had a bitter
 disappointment when I invited her to Bennington and we tried to talk, and
 I couldn't talk to her. I had felt like "Finally, a woman on my level,"
 and her mind seemed so sloooow. It took me ten years before I realized
 what it was. She was born before World War II. There's no way her brain is
 like my brain. I suddenly realized, half my brain is different. I mean,
 half my brain is the traditional Apollonian logo-centric side which was
 trained by the rigorous public schools of that period, but the other half
 is completely an electrified brain. Essentially, what I'm doing is what
 all the '60s was doing, which was exploring the way that brain works. I
 have been exploring both sides of the brain in my work. But we need both.
 Not having both I think is a disaster for the young today because I have
 them in my classes.

 BRAND: You agree with Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death on this?

 PAGLIA: I agree with Neil Postman that we need both. We cannot have one,
 or one over the other. These young kids, they're lost.

 BRAND: If somebody's got both sides of their brain electric, what happens?

 PAGLIA: I think that they become hysterical. They become very susceptible
 to someone's ideology. The longing for something structured, something
 that gives them a world view, is so intense that whatever comes along,
 whether it's fascism or feminist ideology (which to me are inseparable),
 they'll glom onto it and they can't critique it. You see the inability of
 the young to critique this can of worms that feminism gives them -
 "patriarchy" and all this stuff - the inability to think through issues
 like date rape. I was screamed at by girls at Brown about date rape. Later
 I encountered them by chance on the streets of Philadelphia - they
 happened to be touring the country registering voters this summer - and I
 said ask me some questions. These girls were juniors at Brown and their
 minds couldn't even focus long enough for a reply. (Paglia mimics
 fluttering inarticulate interruptions.)

 They didn't have the base of education that I did, the rigorous public
 school education. The consequence is my mind can play in the realm of the
 mass media and that's my creativity as a person, the solid, rigorous
 building of the Apollonian skills on one side of the brain, and then the
 free play. To me, this is the great model of the human mind. It's
 incredible to go back and forth between those two things. This is why I
 don't need anybody in my life, because I have so much in my brain playing
 with each other. It's fantastic.

 When I was in England early in the summer, I was interviewed by some
 Cambridge women and had an incredible intellectual conversation. They were
 full of knowledge and insight. There's no TV whatever in Cambridge.

 BRAND: So all they do is Neil Postman's long cool argument.

 PAGLIA: Well, no. Actually, drinking a lot is what they seem to be doing.
 I think it must be that their extreme, extreme development of words is so
 exhausting. The amount that the educated class is drinking there, I
 couldn't believe it. I saw the public drunkenness in Cambridge of
 university men, staggering drunkenness, and I thought, that's what they
 have instead of pop culture: alcohol.

 The minute I hit London I realized no one looks at each other. I asked
 people there, "How does anyone pick up anyone, how do you ever meet
 anyone?" I was told, "The men never look at you. They respect your
 privacy." Well, OK. I was near the British Museum and we were going to a
 lecture; I needed something to eat, and walked into a pub at 4 o'clock. It
 was respectable - intellectuals and so on. The drunkenness! You could feel
 the sex was in there, in the pubs and the drinking. We've got the sex in
 our popular culture, and the feminists hate it - "sex and violence!" - but
 I think ours is far healthier.

 This is a very healthy culture as long as we keep up the rigorous
 training. The kids' true culture is pop culture - they already live in
 that - so that's why I oppose all this use of TV in school. I want
 education movie-based, in the way that we had in college. From the moment
 I arrived in college in 1964 we were immersed in films. I saw something
 like 800 films. The true multiculturism is foreign films, foreign films
 with subtitles, so you hear the language. That's the way to teach sex, the
 way to talk about male/female sex roles: movies. The way to teach what
 Lacan or Foucault claim to be doing - the relativity of a memory - is
 "Last Year in Marienbad." Did they meet at Marienbad or not? The
 inflections of emotion on people's faces, interrelations of subtleties, of
 non verbal subtleties of interpersonal sexual relations, are shown by
 cinema. Date-rape feminists want to insist, "No always means no." You'd
 never believe that if you were seeing cinema.

 When I think about it, these were mint-condition films. I realize what an
 incredible gift I had. It was a magic moment. There had been the art
 houses in the '50s in the urban centers and suddenly my generation had
 film on the college campuses in the '60s. We were seeing films - Fellini,
 Antonioni - that were five years old. We saw prints in mint condition. No
 one anywhere has that now. The quality of the prints has degenerated, and
 the films are being shown as videos. The way you develop the eye is to see
 great photography, the great high-contrast black-and-white in those films.

 Here's my proposal. A proper job for funding of the arts is to underwrite
 a national consortium of archives of all the classic films. They are too
 expensive to maintain at individual colleges and universities. What I
 envision is, when you go to any college of four years, by your fourth
 year, by rotation, a superb print of every classic film will have been
 shown. We happen to have a very bad print of "Persona" at my school. I
 have to tell the class, "Remember that scene where Bibi Andersson is
 standing, wearing a black dress against a white wall? I have to describe
 to you what Sven Nykvist photography really looked like there. It's a
 blazing white, very rock textured stucco, deep textured. The glossy sun
 glints in her blond hair..."

 This is ridiculous. Classic films are major works of art, and this is
 where the funding should go.

 BRAND: Film had that depth and that quality. Would you also have a
 television course offered?

 PAGLIA: Well, a course in mass media to introduce the student to a history
 of the technologies, the way network news is put together, how different
 our advertisements are from those in Europe, and so on.

 BRAND: What about content? You watch soap operas, right? Which ones?

 PAGLIA: "The Young and the Restless" is my favorite. For 17 years I've
 been watching that. "As the World Turns" is my second favorite. I have the
 TV on with the sound off most of the day. Not early in the morning because
 at that point I'm still dreaming. I'm waking up and I want to remember my
 dreams, so I don't want too many images at that point. By mid-morning it
 is on, on for the rest of the day until 1. I've been poor up to now, and
 my dream is to have someday a bank of TVs, where all the different
 channels could be on and I could be monitoring them. I would love that.
 The more the better. I love the tabloid stuff. The trashier the program
 is, the more I feel it's TV.

 BRAND: Why?

 PAGLIA: Because that's TV's mode. That's the Age of Hollywood. The idea of
 PBS - heavy-duty "Masterpiece Theater," Bill Moyers - I hate all that.

 BRAND: How about the ads?

 PAGLIA: I love ads. There's a section on ads in Volume 2 of Sexual
 Personae. Like Andy Warhol, I have been in love with ads since my earliest
 childhood. That is the way I think. One of the reasons that I probably got
 this famous is because I think and talk in ad terms, in sound-bite terms.
 People say, "She promotes herself." When I was young, I thought in
 newspaper headline terms: "Paglia Falls Off Chair." I feel totally a part
 of mass media. Everyone knows ads are the best part of television, but the
 way the ads work - it's also the way MTV videos work - it's just flash
 flash flash images, symbol symbol symbol. You know, the way that ads are
 structured is not unlike the way the Catholic Church was plastered with
 ads, essentially, for saint this, saint that. To me there was an absolute
 continuity between the Catholic Church and ads.

 See, this is where I drew up my theory that popular culture is the
 eruption of the varied pagan elements in Western culture - that
 Judeo-Christianity never did defeat paganism as history books claim, but
 rather it was driven underground. We've had three major eruptions of
 paganism. One at the Renaissance, and most people would accept that.
 Another was Romanticism, when the chthonic or daemonic element came up
 with all those vampires and the nature cult. And now the third great
 eruption is the 20th century Age of Hollywood. Gore Vidal agrees.
 Hollywood is the great thing that America has done and given to the world.

 BRAND: What happens to those eruptions after a while? Do they eventually
 self-defeat?

 PAGLIA: Well, no, because each one of the eruptions became part of the
 fabric of the future. The eruption of paganism at the Renaissance led
 eventually to the recovery of science, and science has been the greatest
 challenge to Judeo-Christianity. Many want to get rid of the church and
 say it is the biggest source of evil. I hate that talk. A proper society
 will strengthen all its institutions. I want to strengthen the church and
 to strengthen the sex industry. I think they play off each other. Both
 should fight with each other and be strengthened. There will always be a
 craving for religion, and if we don't get it from Catholicism, which is a
 very profound system, you're going to get it from feminist ideology.

 BRAND: Are you glad of the Latin Mass coming back?

 PAGLIA: Where is it coming back?

 BRAND: A few Catholic churches apparently are bringing back the Latin
 Mass, and the hierarchy stopped forbidding it. People like it; they like
 the mysticism.

 PAGLIA: I thought that was a tremendous loss when the church dispensed
 with all that ceremony and imagery and beauty...

 BRAND: ...Priests turning their backs on the congregation...

 PAGLIA: ...Turning their backs. The hierarchy of it, the hieraticism of
 it, that sense of the holy, the mystical, the awesome. What they've got
 now is more authentically like early Christianity. You have a bunch of
 peasants sitting together and holding hands. But what I love is what
 Martin Luther saw was bad, which was the whole pagan element of the
 Italian Catholic Church, the heir of the Roman Empire.

 BRAND: You say pop culture is the third wave of pagan and chthonic stuff.
 You say chthonic stuff is dangerous, and you ride on its danger. Is pop
 culture dangerous?

 PAGLIA: Well, if the culture becomes only that, I think it is, because
 it's filled with hallucinations. Of course that's what I love about it.
 It's surreal. But there are practical realities in everyday life that have
 to be solved - the procedures of corporate life, of academic life, all of
 the boring things that have to be done in a systematic manner, and we have
 be taught those systems. The Apollonian systems also are a heritage of the
 Greco-Roman period. The Apollonian part of the brain is absolutely
 necessary for us to exist as rational citizens. The problem with the New
 Age stuff is it's like all up here, you know (gesturing vaguely aloft). As
 for the channelers, my acting students could do better accents. Credulity
 is a product of lack of rigorous education.

 Here's what I'm saying in my work. You need to pay homage to both Apollo
 and Dionysus. Both are great gods. Both must be honored. We need a balance
 between the two. That's all.

                   DIGITAL CASH MINI-FAQ FOR THE LAYMAN

 By Jim Miller (Jim-Miller@suite.com)

 [If you're on the cypherpunks mailing list, you've already seen this.]

 Here's a description of digital cash that I recently wrote up.  I've
 intentionally generalized and oversimplified the descriptions to keep from
 getting bogged down in the details, but I feel the information is
 accurate.

 Q: How is digital cash possible?
 A: Public-key cryptography and digital signatures (both blind and
 non-blind signatures) make digital cash possible.  It would take too long
 to go into detail how public-key cryptography and digital signatures work.
 But the basic gist is that banks and customers would have public-key
 encryption keys.  Public-key encryption keys come in pairs.  A private key
 known only to the owner, and a public key, made available to everyone.
 Whatever the private key encrypts, the public key can decrypt, and vice
 verse.  Banks and customers use their keys to encrypt (for security) and
 sign (for identification) blocks of digital data that represent money
 orders.  A bank "signs" money orders using its private key and customers
 and merchants verify the signed money orders using the bank's widely
 published public key.  Customers sign deposits and withdraws using their
 private key and the bank uses the customer's public key to verify the
 signed withdraws and deposits.

 Q: Are there different kinds of digital cash?
 A: Yes.  In general, there are two distinct types of digital cash:
 identified digital cash and anonymous digital cash.  Identified digital
 cash contains information revealing the identity of the person who
 originally withdrew the money from the bank.  Also, in much the same
 manner as credit cards, identified digital cash enables the bank to track
 the money as it moves through the economy.  Anonymous digital cash works
 just like real paper cash.  Once anonymous digital cash is withdrawn from
 an account, it can be spent or given away without leaving a transaction
 trail.  You create anonymous digital cash by using numbered bank accounts
 and blind signatures rather than fully identified accounts and non-blind
 signatures.

 [To better understand blind signatures and their use with digital cash, I
 highly recommend skimming through chapters 1 - 6 of Bruce Schneier's book
 _Applied Cryptography_ (available at your favorite technical book store).
 Bruce does a very good job of describing the wide variety of interesting
 things you can do when you combine computers, networks, and cryptography.
 The first half-dozen chapters are quite readable, even to the layman.  He
 doesn't get into the heavy-duty math until later in the book.]

 There are two varieties of each type of digital cash: online digital cash
 and offline digital cash.  Online means you need to interact with a bank
 (via modem or network) to conduct a transaction with a third party.
 Offline means you can conduct a transaction without having to directly
 involve a bank.  Offline anonymous digital cash is the most complex form
 of digital cash because of the double-spending problem.

 Q: What is the double-spending problem?
 A: Since digital cash is just a bunch of bits, a piece of digital cash is
 very easy to duplicate.  Since the copy is indistinguishable from the
 original you might think that counterfeiting would be impossible to
 detect.  A trivial digital cash system would allow me to copy of a piece
 of digital cash and spend both copies.  I could become a millionaire in a
 matter of a few minutes.  Obviously, real digital cash systems must be
 able to prevent or detect double spending.

 Online digital cash systems prevent double spending by requiring merchants
 to contact the bank's computer with every sale.  The bank computer
 maintains a database of all the spent pieces of digital cash and can
 easily indicate to the merchant if a given piece of digital cash is still
 spendable.  If the bank computer says the digital cash has already been
 spent, the merchant refuses the sale.  This is very similar to the way
 merchants currently verify credit cards at the point of sale.

 Offline digital cash systems detect double spending in a couple of
 different ways.  One way is to create a special smart card containing a
 tamper-proof chip called an "Observer" (in some systems).  The Observer
 chip keeps a mini database of all the pieces of digital cash spent by that
 smart card.  If the owner of the smart card attempts to copy some digital
 cash and spend it twice, the imbedded Observer chip would detect the
 attempt and would not allow the transaction.  Since the Observer chip is
 tamper-proof, the owner cannot erase the mini-database without permanently
 damaging the smart card.

 The other way offline digital cash systems handle double spending is to
 structure the digital cash and cryptographic protocols so the identity of
 the double spender is known by the time the piece of digital cash makes it
 way back to the bank.  If users of the offline digital cash know they will
 get caught, the incidents of double spending will be minimized (in
 theory).  The advantage of these kinds of offline systems is that they
 don't require special tamper-proof chips.   The entire system can be
 written in software and can run on ordinary PCs or cheap smart cards.

 It is easy to construct this kind of offline system for identified digital
 cash.  Identified offline digital cash systems can accumulate the complete
 path the digital cash made through the economy.  The identified digital
 cash "grows" each time it is spent.  The particulars of each transaction
 are appended to the piece of digital cash and travel with it as it moves
 from person to person, merchant to vender.  When the cash is finally
 deposited, the bank checks its database to see if the piece of digital
 cash was double spent.  If the digital cash was copied and spent more than
 once, it will eventually appear twice in the "spent" database.  The bank
 uses the transaction trails to identify the double spender.

 Offline anonymous digital cash (sans Observer chip) also grows with each
 transaction, but the information that is accumulated is of a different
 nature.  The result is the same however.  When the anonymous digital cash
 reaches the bank, the bank will be able to examine it's database and
 determine if the digital cash was double spent.  The information
 accumulated along the way will identify the double spender.

 The big difference between offline anonymous digital cash and offline
 identified digital cash is that the information accumulated with anonymous
 digital cash will only reveal the identity of the spender if the cash is
 double spent.  If the anonymous digital cash is not double spent, the bank
 can not determine the identity of the original spender nor can it
 reconstruct the path the cash took through the economy.

 With identified digital cash, both offline or online, the bank can always
 reconstruct the path the cash took through the economy.  The bank will
 know what everyone bought, where they bought it, when they bought it, and
 how much they paid.  And what the bank knows, the IRS knows.

 By the way, did you declare that $20 bill your Grandmother gave you for
 your birthday?  You didn't?  Well, you wont have to worry about forgetting
 those sorts of things when everybody is using fully identified digital
 cash.  As a matter of fact, you wont even have to worry about filing a tax
 return.  The IRS will just send you a bill.

           PATENT SEARCHING EMAIL SERVER is now open for business

 By Gregory Aharonian (srctran@world.std.com)


    APS PATENT SEARCHING ARRIVES ON THE INTERNET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    (well only in a real limited way for the time being :-)

 A few weeks ago, I announced plans to provide limited patent searching
 over the Internet, where you can get a list of patents by specifying the
 class/subclass.

 I have decided to do this in two stages.  To test out the email-server
 software I am writing, I first plan to allow email requests to retreive parts
 of the PTO classification manuals (see below).  Once things are running
 smoothly, I will then add the capability to retrieve patent titles by
 class/subclass.

 So feel free to start sending in requests to the address listed below:

 search@world.std.com

 wish me luck, and start thinking philanthropic.  By the way, if someone has a
 machine readable version of the WIPO international classification system,
 please send it to me so I can add it to the server.  At some point when I
 have lots of equipment, I will sort US patents by their international
 classification.

 Internet Patent News Service

                              ====================

                          Internet Patent News Service
                                 September 1994

                           PATENT TITLES EMAIL SERVER
                              search@world.std.com

 The Internet Patent News Service is pleased to announced the availability
 of the Patent Titles email server, where people can retrieve lists of patent
 titles dating back to 1970 for any USPTO class/subclass, and patent numbers
 for additional patents dating back to the 1800's.  The Patent Titles email
 server is the first step in our efforts to make the entire USPTO APS patent
 text database system accessible over the Internet.

 Approximately one gigabyte of data has been prepared and attached to the
 Internet.  As all of the equipment and network access is borrowed, I am
 limiting access to an email server until I get a better feel for demand for
 the data, and until I can raise funding to set up a proper Internet server.

 Unless the bandwidth and processing load overwhelms the equipment I am
 borrowing, the service will be free.

 To use the email server, send requests to the Internet address:

 search@world.std.com

 using any of the following commands sent as text in the body of the email
 message:

 SENDTO  account-name@internet.site.adr

 This command is mandatory of all requests and is where you specify the email
 address you want the information sent to. Occasionally From: lines in email
 addresses do not provide a correct return address (at least in my experience
 doing the Internet Patent News Service).

 SEND INTRO
 SEND HELP

 Either of these commands will return this message.

 SEND UCLASSES

 This command will return an index to the approximately 400 patent classes
 that are currently being used, for example:
 Class: 69     Leather Manufacturers

 SEND UCLASS XXX

 This command will return that section of the USPTO's Manual of Classification
 covering patent class XXX.  For example, the command "SEND CLASS 69" would
 return a list of all of the subclasses in Class 69 by number and title.
 These files range in size from 5K to 120K.  What follows is a section
 of Class 69:

  Subclass  Subclass
  Number    Title
  1       MACHINES
  1.5     .Belt-stretching
  3       .Horse collar shaping
  4       .Horse collar stuffing

 SEND UCLASS COMPUTING

 This command will return those sections of the USPTO's Manual of
 Classification covering patent classes 395 and 364, the two main classes
 dealing with hardware and software.

 SEND IPNSINFO

 This command will return an introductory message to my Internet Patent News
 Service.

 SEND CONSULT

 This command will return an introductory message to my patent searching
 consulting services I offer.

 SAVE COMMENT

 This command lets me know your request is actually a comment about the email
 server operation, or any inaccuracies you detect in the patent information
 being sent out.

 As I am parasiting the equipment to run the server (which basically means
 that I operate the server at nite and on weekends), please send your requests
 in at the end of the workday or on weekends.  Within a day or so, you will
 receive back ny email whatever you requested.

 SECURITY
 A very important concern for anyone using this email server is secrecy,
 that what they are searching for is not revealed to others. As a potential
 inventor, I appreciate this as much as anyone else.  While I plan to save the
 email addresses of people who use the server (but not their search request),
 no other information will be retained.  The email address information will be
 saved to study who, and how often, people are using the server.  I would
 appreciate any suggestions on how to ensure security beyond this.

 Please excuse any mishaps that occur as I get this service off the ground.
 This email server is a classic hack that will get better in time as people
 use it.  In turn, the experience gathered in running the server will be
 invaluable in demonstrating the feasibility of making massive amounts of
 patent data available over the Internet.

 Also, get ready for that voluntary registration fee I mention in my intro
 piece to the Internet Patent News Service.  If the Patent Titles email server
 is successful, and you all like it, this fall I plan to coordinate an effort
 to put all of the patent abstract information since 1970 onto the Internet,
 making it available through email servers, Gopher, WAIS and Mosaic. But first
 things first, getting the Patent Titles email server working.

            Five "Hackers" Indicted for Credit Card/Computer Fraud

 From CuD Moderators <cudigest@mindvox.phantom.com>
 Computer Underground Digest

 (AP WIRE - Thurs, Sept. 8, 1994)

     NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- "Dr. Demonicus," "Renegade" and four other
hackers used computers to steal credit card numbers and used them to
buy $210,000 in gold coins and high-tech hardware, federal prosecutors
said Wednesday (Sept 8, '94).

The nine-count indictment unsealed Wednesday charged five men from
Louisana and one from New York with conspiracy, computer fraud, access
device fraud and wire fraud, U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan Jr. said.

Some fo their hacker nicknames were included. They were identified as
Dwayne "Dr. Demonicus" Comeger, 22; Brian Ursin, 21; John Christopher
"Renegade" Montegut, 24; Timothy "Revelation" Thompson, 21; James
McGee, 25; and Raymone "Wiseguy" Savage, 25, of Richmond Hills, N.Y.

                              CLIPPER T-SHIRTS

 By Norman Harman (normh@crl.com)

 Information and opposition to the Clipper proposal is strong on the
 Internet.  But it is far too unknown to the 'outside' community.  Everyone
 concerned by this issue should inform all the people they know of its
 implications.  One way to increase awareness and show your opinion is to
 wear it:).

 I would like to offer an anti Clipper/Skipjack T-shirt.  They would be white
 with black printing and cost approximately $5.00 plus $2.90 shipping to US
 locations. That is the cost to produce one shirt.  I am trying to spread
 awareness not make money.

 I need to know if people are interested in this idea and what should the
 shirts say?

 Two quick ideas are:
    "Skip Skipjack"
    or
    "Just Say No to Clipper"

 Please send comments, suggestions, and questions to normh@crl.com.  If more
 than a few people are interested I will go ahead and have the shirts made
 and post how to get one.

 A worthy cause is better if it benefits another good cause so the shirts
 will be silk-screened by Zerolith, part of a non-profit organization that
 employs, shelters, and assists homeless youth.  If you would like to talk
 with Zerolith or donate money directly here is how to contact them.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

       CyberNews, A Monthly Publication,  Debuts With A Stunning
                    Success for Readers/Advertisers

 St. Louis, MO, September 8 _ CyberNews, a new monthly electronic
 publication, debuted today featuring over 25 hard hitting, real world
 software reviews, a tell all interview with shareware king Scott Miller
 of Apogee Software, the people that brought the world Castle Wolfenstein
 and a feature by the leaders in the Work at Home field, Paul and Sarah
 Edwards.

 CyberNews is unique in electronic publications, commonly referred to
 as zines, due to the fact they are advertiser supported and 85% of the
 information is generated from everyday people. "Too many reviews today
 are done to please the advertiser. Heck, most of the traditional press
 basically reprint press releases. People need to know what
 software/hardware works and what problems may crop up. Unbiased reviews
 are what we strive for," detailed Patrick Grote, Publisher, Marketing.

 Available in three formats, CyberNews is readable by anyone. A
 Windows Help file format supports a color graphical excursion that
 anyone with Windows, Windows for Workgroups or WindowsNT can view. "We
 wanted to bring the electronic publication into a new era of color and
 production," notes Roger Klein, Publisher, Production.

 The ASCII version features the ability to be enjoyed by anyone with
 a  PC, dumb terminal or device that has the ability to read standard
 ASCII text. According to Patrick Grote, Publisher, Marketing, "the goal
 was to make CyberNews as Internet friendly as possible. Since we use
 straight ASCII everyone who can access the Internet can read our
 publication."

    The ReadRoom format allows Sysops to add CyberNews to their BBS
 quickly without having to run a conversion program. "Sysops are the
 backbone of the information superhighway. They are engineer, designer,
 construction worker and user wrapped into one. We realized we can't
 ignore their needs," explained Publisher, Marketing, Patrick Grote.

         PC MAGAZINE DECARES THE PIPELINE BEST INTERNET SERVICE

 By James Gleick (gleick@pipeline.com)

 We at the Pipeline are very pleased to announce that the editors of PC
 Magazine, comparing all the major Internet service providers from America
 Online and Delphi down to the Pipeline, have declared that our young
 service is the best choice.

 We have a lot of room for improvement, we know, but coming in our first
 year, this is gratifying.

 "A true beauty queen," Robin Raskin, PC Magazine's editor, writes in the
 October 11 issue. "The Pipeline is an elegantly conceived program; we've
 seldom seen a Version 1.x program that's as well thought out. Watch as the
 Pipeline continues to grow; the Internet will be a better place because of
 this package."

 We hope so. Anyway, we'd like to take the opportunity to offer Internet
 users (or would-be Internet users) a free copy of our software, to try
 out in demo mode. It's available for Windows or Macintosh. Send your
 address to windisk@pipeline.com or macdisk@pipeline.com. For general
 information, you may send email to info@pipeline.com.

          IMPORTANT PROCLAMATION: THE FUTURE OF THE NET IS AT HAND!

 By James "Kibo" Parry (kibo@world.std.com)

 P R O C L A M A T I O N   &   M A N I F E S T O
 ***********************************************

 WHEREAS, the computer network named USENET has insurmountable flaws:

 => It is cluttered with thousands of disorganized groups.
 => It is difficult to use due to the various software interfaces.
 => It is infected with viruses, especially in the .signatures.
 => There is no formal rulebook and no official administration.
 => Bozos abound.
 => Power-crazed maniacs frequently try to manipulate Usenet at their whim.

 These problems are most important.  THEREFORE, in an official and secret
 democratic vote, Kibo has been duly elected LEADER OF THE NET.  To correct
 this heinous situation, LEADER KIBO has decided to take bold measures,
 a brave new initiative, detailed herein.

 WAKE UP, IT'S 1994!  THE FUTURE WILL NOT WAIT FOR A VOTE!

 Here is what Leader Kibo has decided--what MUST be done--what WILL be done:

 PHASE ONE.  GLOBAL RMGROUPS FOR ALL USENET GROUPS WILL BE
             ISSUED ON 4/15/94, 06:00 GMT.

 A Day Without Usenet shall pass, and it will be a time of rest for
 government employees.  Many will discover life, or at least television.
 Desperate soc.singles readers will have nervous breakdowns.  ClariNet
 will go bankrupt.  UUNET's modems will cool off.  The world
 will rotate a full three hundred sixty degrees just the same.

 Every Usenet group, and all its associated problems, will have been
 wiped off the face of the Earth forever by the might of the rmgroup.
 Of course, to prevent any power-crazed maniacs from putting the
 groups back, the newsgroup `control' will be rmgrouped FIRST.  Thus,
 the situation will be permanent.  Nobody will undo the Pax Kibotica!

 PHASE TWO.  NEWGROUPS FOR THE GROUPS IN THE NEW HIERARCHY WILL
             BE ISSUED ON 4/16/43, 06:00 GMT.

 The new network shall be named HAPPYNET, as it will be a Better Place.
 Usenet is dead.  Long live HappyNet!

 ********* HAPPYNET: THE NET THAT'S HAPPIER THAN YOU! *********

 UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE ALL-WISE LEADER KIBO,
 THE NEW NETWORK SHALL BE ORGANIZED THUSLY:

 Three hierarchies encompassing ALL HUMAN DISCOURSE:

 =>  nonbozo.*

 =>  bozo.*

 =>  megabozo.*

 All topics discussed on Usenet, and even deeper topics which COULD
 be discussed on Usenet but AREN'T, will fit nicely in those three--
 NO EXCEPTIONS.  Extensive time and motion studies have been
 performed in the name of efficiency to maximize your pleasure!
 Existing groups will be moved into the new organization
 scheme, resulting in nonbozo.news.announce.newusers, bozo.rec.pets,
 megabozo.talk.bizarre, nonbozo.comp.virus, bozo.alt.sex,
 megabozo.alt.fan.lemurs, bozo.postmodern, megabozo.org.mensa,
 nonbozo.clari.news.urgent, megabozo.megabozo.megabozo.religion.kibology,
 etc., as determined by scientific measurements of the bozosity of the
 groups, measured by Leader Kibo's Council On Scientific Bozosity and the
 faculty of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, NY), world leaders in
 bozosity assessment.  These truly scientific procedures were developed
 and pre-tested by Drs. Todd M. McComb and Tim Gallagher and are patented
 to prove that they are good!

 It is estimated that the statistical breakdown of HappyNet will be thus:

  1.0000%  nonbozo.*
 90.0000%  bozo.*
  9.0000%  megabozo.*     (Computations courtesy of Bell Labs)

 Bozo.* will, of course, be subdivided logically:  bozo.nerd.*, bozo.tv.*,
 bozo.inane.*, bozo.boring.*, bozo.sex.*, bozo.argue.*.

 New groups will also be added for MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT.  The network would
 be a very unfair place if only Leader Kibo were allowed to propose new
 groups.  Instead, because Leader Kibo is benevolent and omnisagaciously
 father-like, he will create WHATEVER GROUP YOU WANT (even, say,
 megabozo.kibo.is.a.blenny!) provided that (a) you follow the Official
 Procedure, filing all five copies of your request in triplicate and then
 making seven carbons of each, and (b) you pay Leader Kibo $160 for each
 letter in the new group's name, and $720 for each period.  UNLIKE SOMEARCHAIC SYSTEMS, VOWELS DO NOT COST EXTRA.  PAT SAJAK IS EVIL!

 Of course, thanks to Leader Kibo's awesome foresight, new groups will
 probably not be needed.  A simple computer program will generate all
 groupnames from *.aaaaa.aaaaa.aaaaa.aaaaa to *.zzzzz.zzzzz.zzzzz.zzzzz.
 This will encompass ALL possibilities in a COMPLETELY LOGICAL FASHION,
 maximally efficient yet FUN!  Prudence and foresight by LEADER KIBO!

 There will even be a .d group for every regular group.  In fact,
 the .d groups will even have their own .d.d groups for metadiscussion
 of whether or not the new .d.d.d and .d.d.d.d groups are needed at all!

 The wealth of new groups will also cut down on those annoying egomaniacal
 posters who try to post the same article to EVERY group, because it will
 become physically impossible to post to ALL groups within a MORTAL LIFETIME!

 But wait, there's more--over six billion groups MORE will be added at
 HappyNet's inception--free of charge!

 ********* HAPPYNET: EVERYONE IS EQUALLY EQUAL! *********

 To promote EQUALITY and POLITICAL CORRECTNESS (the good kind), Leader
 Kibo has decided to correct the inequality of the distribution of
 "personal" groups.  Some people, or groups of people, currently are
 popular enough to have groups named in their honor: alt.weemba,
 alt.fan.john-palmer, alt.fan.monty-python, alt.fan.dave-barry,
 alt.fan.mike-jittlov, alt.fan.naked-guy, alt.religion.kibology,
 alt.fan.alok-vijayvargia, alt.fan.harry-mandel.  Because everyone is
 equal before the eyes of wise Leader Kibo, it was decided that EVERYONE
 WILL HAVE THEIR OWN GROUP on HappyNet.  This will celebrate the
 global diversity of our users, demonstrating for once and for all
 that they are all unique, but unique in exactly the same way!

 A scientific questionnaire developed specifically for the purpose will be
 mailed to everyone on the planet.  It will read:

   Dear Citizen Of The New Network,

   You are being given your own HappyNet group.  Its placement
   will depend on your answer to this simple question.

   ARE YOU A BOZO? (CHECK EXACTLY ONE)    [] YES   [] NO

                                  I care,
                                  Leader Kibo

 People who answer "yes" will be given groups in bozo.personal.*, and
 people who answer "no" will be given groups in megabozo.personal.*.
 People who refuse to answer, or show contempt for the process, will be
 taken (by the Network Security Patrol Force) to the Citadel Of Judgment
 to appear before the Council Of Bozosity, who will examine the person and
 assign them either bozo.weenie.* or megabozo.weenie.*.

 Of course, this would be POINTLESS if anyone in the world were DENIED
 ACCESS to HappyNet.

 ********* HAPPYNET: A NET IN EVERY POT! *********

 Net access will be provided to EVERY SINGLE PERSON, LIVING, UNBORN, OR
 DEAD, thanks to the new TELESCREENS which will be installed in every room
 of every building on the planet.  Not only will this encourage higher net
 communications volume, it will also help Leader Kibo be a good leader, as
 it will allow Leader Kibo to instantly broadcast to all his subjects, and
 to see how they are feeling and what they are doing.

 But simple TELESCREENS in LIVING ROOMS, BEDROOMS, and BATHROOMS are
 not enough to ensure FREEDOM and EQUALITY.  Neural transceivers will
 be implanted, FREE, at BIRTH in all newborns, allowing them to "jack in"
 to HappyNet, transmitting articles, sounds, and even GIF files at
 the speed of thought!  They won't even have to worry about spelling--
 they'll just THINK and their EVERY THOUGHT will be broadcast into
 EVERYONE ELSE'S HEADS!

 And because Leader Kibo CARES and values YOUR opinion, this will even
 allow Leader Kibo to know what his subjects are THINKING, thanks to the
 heroic actions of the NETWORK SECURITY PATROL FORCE.

 ********* HAPPYNET: WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING *********

 The Network Security Patrol Force, or NSPF, will be composed of volunteer
 system administrators who wish to enforce the continued accuracy,
 relevance, and acceptability of HappyNet postings.  They will monitor,
 censor, and cancel bad postings, made by EVIL SUBVERSIVES who attempt to
 DEPRIVE you of your HAPPINESS.  These SUPPRESSIVE PERSONS will be
 hunted down and suppressed!

 NSPF officers have really spiffy uniforms, especially the shiny gas masks,
 well-balanced batons, six-inch-thick shoulder pads and twelve-inch cleats.

 And, of course, they will punish evildoers, night or day.  HappyNet
 never sleeps.

 ******* HAPPYNET: SLEEP TIGHT WITH ALL THE SECURITY IN THE WORLD! *********

 But what of those EVIL organizations that simply want to SPY on you?  Well,
 the NSPF won't have to even TRY to prevent that, because the LOGICAL PLAN
 of HAPPYNET will defeat that automatically!  If some three-letter government
 agency wants to SCAN all articles for WORDS LIKE "NUCLEAR BOMB" or
 "WHITEWATER", it will be IMPOSSIBLE because not even the fastest
 computer in the WORLD--the CRAY-9000--could search ALL THOSE GROUPS, EVER!!!

 ********* HAPPYNET: ACCURACY IS EVERYTHING ON HAPPYNET! *********

 Here are examples of infractions against the unwritten rules of HappyNet,
 and the punishments the NSPF will bring against the villains.


 .signature longer than four lines: Forced to read "War And Peace" at 110
 baud.

 .signature has giant ASCII graphic: Forced to read "War And Peace" at 110
 baud on a Braille terminal after having fingers rubbed with sandpaper.

 Posting an article consisting solely of "Me too!": Poster's legal name is
 officially changed to "Me Too".

 Calling a newsgroup a "bboard" or "notesfile": Forced to memorize
 Webster's Ninth.

 Spelling "too" as "to", "it's" as "its", "lose" as "loose", "you're"
 as "your", or any of the following--"wierd", "Anti-Semetic", "senerio",
 or "masterbation": Forced to write out Webster's Ninth ten times.

 Asking what ":-)" means: Drawing, quartering, and turning sideways.

 Using "<g>" instead of ":-)": being sent back to GEnie, AOL, Delphi, etc.

 Sending a newgroup message without permission of Leader Kibo: Poster is
 forced to adopt twelve wacky sitcom children.

 Posting flames outside of a *.flame group: Poster is allowed to read only
 groups about fluffy puppies.

 Posting "Please send e-mail, since I don't read this group": Poster is
 rendered illiterate by a simple trepanation.

 *Plonk*ing outside talk.bizarre: Poster is *plonked*--LITERALLY.

 Asking for people to send cards to Craig Shergold:  Poster must answer
 all of Craig's mail.

 Posting the "Dave Rhodes: MAKE MONEY FAST" scam:  Poster must answer all
 of Craig's and Dave's mail while also memorizing the script to every
 episode of "Knight Rider" and doing voice exercises like saying
 "NANCY, HAND THE MAN THE DANDY CANDY" ten million times and also
 being forced to eat cottage cheese we found piled up on the sidewalk.

 Posting to aus.* from the USA: Poster is deported to Australia after having
 a "Kick Me, Mate" sign glued to their forehead.

 Posting an article with a malformed address so that mail bounces when
 people reply: Poster and/or their admin are sent back to kindergarten.

 Excess CAPITALIZATION & PUNCTUATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Poster is issued a new
 keyboard without capitals or punctuation.  The space bar will be clearly
 labelled.

 *Excess*asterisks*in*.signature*: Poster is hit with one shuriken for
 each asterisk.

 Articles quoted in followup, but no new semantic content appended: Poster
 is forced to watch a "Small Wonder" marathon on cable TV.

 Advertising on the net: Poster is forced to pay Leader Kibo for the
 advertising time.

 Asking help for some program but not saying what sort of computer you're
 using: Poster's computer is reduced to 1K RAM.

 Arguing over whose computer is better: Being introduced to Leader Kibo,
 whose custom Turbissimo MoNDO Zeugma 6866688786/XA/sxe/IV computer is far
 better than theirs and will make them cry in humiliation.

 Giving away the secret of "The Crying Game": No punishment.

 Making fools of people in rec.org.mensa with pranks: No punishment
 necessary for something that simple.  After all, some people could
 even do it by accident.

 Referring to the NSPF as "The Thought Police": Execution.

 Humor impairment: Execution.

 Saying "Imminent death of the net predicted!": Imminent execution of
 poster predicted.

 Mentioning Star Trek outside of the Star Trek groups: "Star Trek:
 Deep Space Nine" is cancelled, and all tapes of the original series are
 burned.  William Shatner will direct all future movies.


 There are other helpful rules and regulations, but they are double secret.

 Of course, various branches of the NSPF will specialize in various
 enforcements: the Spelling Squad, the Grammar Goons, the Definition
 Draconians, the Typo Tyrants, the Capitalization Captains, the Pedantic
 Patriots, the Cross-Post Crushers, the Cascade Commandos, and
 the .signature .specialforce.  There will even be a special detail to
 track down, and burn, copies of the Green Golfball Joke.

 ********* HAPPYNET: MODERATION IN ALL THINGS! *********

 The concept of moderated groups will be retained for a few groups,
 with minor changes.

 Alt.flame (renamed megabozo.alt.flame) will be moderated by Dave Lawrence,
 as his news.announce.newgroups duties have been assumed by Leader Kibo.
 Dick Depew will be assigned the task of making up an imaginative
 Message-ID for every article in the world.  (He will also unleash random
 daemons onto the net to destroy the unpleasant signal to noise ratio
 completely.)

 A program that determines how funny an article is by measuring the
 frequency of the "k" sound (an elementary comedic principle discovered in
 Kukamonga, Arkansas) will replace rec.humor.funny moderator Maddi Hausmann,
 allowing her to devote full time to assisting Brad Templeton's
 nonbozo.clarinet.* duties.

 Serdar Argic will be the official underliner of HappyNet.  Every time
 the word "turkey" is mentioned, he will post a followup underlining and
 circling it.  This will be a tremendous help to people looking for
 low-fat recipes.

 Jay O'Connell has volunteered to personally deliver an envelope labelled
 THESE ARE ALL THE TOPLESS PICTURES OF MARINA SIRTIS THERE ARE to all
 users to prevent them from asking for them over and over.  This should
 reduce the bandwidth by an estimated 90%.

 Iain Sinclair will ensure that the link between Australia and the rest of
 the world is down on a regular schedule, instead of an irregular one.
 He has also been commissioned to design the NSPF uniforms, with the
 blessings of the Florida Citrus Council and the California Leather Council.

 And, of course, a world-class anonymous-posting server will be
 established.  Not only will it remove your name from your postings (so
 that you don't have to worry about defending your opinions) but it will
 also eliminate the opinions themselves.  Thus, don't be surprised to see
 a lot of anonymous postings in bozo.alt.sex.stories saying simply
 "I have no opinion on homosexuality."  HappyNet will help us all to get
 along, even the people with no names.

 But what about those disclaimers that state that your opinion is not
 that of IBM, McDonalds, MIT, Scientology, etc.?

 Disclaimers are NOT required on articles, therefore you MUST include
 the following:

   DISCLAIMER: THIS DISCLAIMER IS NOT REQUIRED BY LEADER KIBO.
   THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE OPINIONS OF LEADER KIBO.
   THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH LEADER KIBO EITHER.
   HAVE A NICE DAY!

 Also, for your protection, Leader Kibo has filed a copyright claim on
 HappyNet.  Thus, any postings without a copyright notice become the
 intellectual property of Kibo.  This will keep random people from
 commercially exploiting your ideas, because they won't be
 YOUR ideas any more!  It's THAT SIMPLE.  STREAMLINE EVERYTHING!

 ******** HAPPYNET: A BLAST TO LIGHT OUR GLOWING FUTURE! ********

 HappyNet as currently implemented is just one communications medium.
 But this will blast our way into the foundation of the future:
 Eventually, HappyNet will be expanded to replace the other
 `conventional' media, such as newspapers, television, radio, standup
 comedy, and sex.  .signatures will be sixty-second commercials.  Alt.sex
 (bozo.alt.sex) will be interactive and finally worth reading.

 A PBS series, "Great RFCs, Past and Present" will be filmed to replace
 the boring old text RFCs.  A Fox series, hosted by Dr. Ruth Westheimer,
 will replace "Emily Postnews".

 The Sony Walkman will become obsolete thanks to the Sony rnman.  The
 instructions will be on a separate device, the Sony manman.

 Once everyone in the world is hooked into the giant HappyNet neural
 network and their brains merge into one gigantic community of mind
 (with an IQ well over THREE HUNDRED!), local events will be instantly
 communicated everywhere in the world.  For example, people in Sri Lanka
 will be able to INSTANTLY receive dozens of "Hey, we're having a minor
 earthquake here in San Francisco RIGHT NOW!" postings INSTANTLY, instead
 of having to wait weeks.  Rumors of such important events as DeForest
 Kelley's death will also propagate instantly, but this is not really
 a drawback: it enables the NSPF to detect them and snuff them out faster!

 HappyNet is an important part of this well-balanced future.  In fact,
 it is the ONLY part.  Without HappyNet, there could be no future.
 Usenet paves the road to misery and ruin with its cascades, cross-posts,
 flame wars, forgeries, and .signature viruses.  HappyNet does not pave
 this road--where it's going, we don't NEED roads!  HappyNet bravely
 journeys into an unknown, but not unpleasant future.  Everyone WILL
 be happy, happier than human beings can possibly be.

 Although it will take HappyNet months, maybe years, to improve all
 areas of daily existence in all possible ways, it will be obvious to
 the most casual reader that HappyNet is better than Usenet.
 Those who aren't casual readers--well, they will come to agree.
 In time, they will even love me.  In fact, soon they will beg to
 love me!  But I, Leader Kibo, want only the best for everyone.
 After all, I am one of the readers of Usenet, so I can make the
 readers of Usenet happy by making me happy FIRST.  DEATH TO USENET!
 LONG LIVE HAPPYNET!  TO THE MOON!

 ********* HAPPYNET: YOU CONTROL HOW IT CONTROLS YOU *********

             Project Galactic Guide Frequently Asked Questions

                FAQ  Mk. II  Release 1.1  18 September 1994


 This is the Mostly All-New FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) information file
 for the Usenet group alt.galactic-guide.  This file is intended to provide
 you with answers to your frequently asked questions and is 97% fat-free with
 no preservatives or artificial flavours.

 1.0  What is this newsgroup?
 ----------------------------
 This newsgroup was created for the sole purpose of allowing uninterrupted
 communication between people involved in Project Galactic Guide.  What is
 this project, you ask?

 It all started back in, oh, November of 1991 in the alt.fan.douglas-adams
 newsgroup.  For the uninformed, Douglas Adams is the author of a series
 of humourous s/f books centering on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
 In these books, the characters write for and frequently consult a sort of
 electronic encyclopedia which has an entry on just about everything.

 Paul said, "Hey, why don't we create a REAL guide to the galaxy?" and
 everyone else said, "Sounds good, let's do it!".  So, with great fervor
 we started working on the skeletal structure of Project Galactic Guide,
 although at that time, we often called it "The HitchHiker's Guide the Known
 Galaxy."

 It was originally supposed to be about REAL things (as opposed to made-up
 things), but we eventually broke down and decided to incorporate
 EVERYTHING.  So, now we'll take humorous entries about fictitious things
 (done in the Douglas Adams style, of course), and humorous entries about
 real things (also done in the Douglas Adams style, of course).


 2.0  Who's in charge around here?
 ---------------------------------
 Well, not anyone, really.  Er, actually, I suppose there *are* a couple of
 froods who tend to have a bit more input about things than others, but
 really it's mostly chaotic.  Well, not actually *chaotic* but instead maybe
 something a bit more like a good recess.

 The aforementioned Paul Clegg is one of PGG's Founding Fathers.  He is
 easily identifiable by his "...Paul" signature.  Paul wrote the first PGG
 FAQ, upon which this document is derived.  Today, Paul's an Editor and has
 many Wise Things to say about topics, issues, concerns, thoughts, ideas,
 problems, suggestions, and comments.  His action figure should be available
 for the holiday season (along with the PGG Mothership playset), and he is
 available via email at:  cleggp@rpi.edu

 Steve Baker helped get the project rolling with his "The Guide!" software
 for IBM/MS-DOS machines in the spring of 1992.  Steve usually answers to
 the nom de plume "Stevadelic."  Today, Steve's an Editor, the Librarian,
 Captain of the PGG Mothership, and actively avoids doing required updates
 and bug fixes to the TG! system.  (He claims to be too busy working on
 Klingon language translation software.)  You can send email to Steve at
 the address:  swbaker@vela.acs.oakland.edu

 Roel van der Meulen joined the project in the fall of 1993, and is an
 active PGG Field Researcher Recruiter (he finds new articles and authors
 for PGG, in addition to his own work).  He also maintains the PGG archives
 contents file and one of the fine WWW sites.  Roel's Internet email address
 is:  vdmeulen@rulrol.leidenuniv.nl

 Jeff Kramer is compiling the "PGG Report," a regular newsletter with lots
 of great information about the Project and its activities.  He also admin's
 one of the PGG WWW sites.  Jeff is available at:  lthumper@bga.com

 Ryan Tucker provides articles, ideas, and crazy text art (like the FAQ
 logo), as well as up-to-date Iowa weather reports (as long as there's a
 tornado).  Ryan's available at:  rtucker@worf.infonet.net

 There's a lot of others out there who have contributed t-shirt designs,
 press card information, articles, ideas, suggestions, comments, et al...
 but to avoid this becoming one of those "Hi folks"-type things, I'll just
 leave it at that.


 2.1  So who do I send articles to?
 ----------------------------------
 Paul is available from September until April or May (during the college
 school year), and Steve is on-line and available year-round.  Both Paul
 and Steve also have America Online accounts, so they're available there
 as well.  Now that I think about it, Steve actually collects email accounts
 (he's now up to six different active, on-line email accounts, which is
 quite a lot of passwords to get straight).

 To answer the question, however, let's just say that you should send
 articles to one of the PGG Editors:

      cleggp@rpi.edu                       -- Paul
      swbaker@vela.acs.oakland.edu         -- Steve

 We also have a third editor, Michael Bravo, who handles articles written
 in the Russian language.  If you have written an article in Russian, please
 send them to Michael (mbravo@octopus.spb.su).


 3.0  Format of the articles
 ---------------------------
 The articles that are accepted are organized by category and compiled in
 article "archives."  Each archive file contains 25 accepted Guide entries.
 These archives are stored and available for download from the PGG
 Mothership.

 We've decided upon a simple ASCII text format for the article entries.  The
 specs on the format are contained in the "article.new" file.  It's really
 pretty simple, with just a few header token-type things that define useful
 stuff.

 The fine folks at PGG spent about a year discussing, debating, formulating,
 postulating, configuring, finalizing, and neglecting a nifty but complex
 text format.  It was complete with crazy text formatting things and lots of
 other fun and wonderful features, but it never really caught on.  Oh well.

 We're currently investigating the possibilities of porting the article
 archives into HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for use with html and WWW
 viewers.  For now, however, standard ASCII files are just fine!


 3.1  Article content and legal stuff
 ------------------------------------
 You're welcome to write about anything.  Yes, no matter how bizarre or
 crazy, please write about it.  Really.  Anything.

 Er, except, we don't want you to regurgitate Adams' material.  Not only is
 this very unoriginal, it's also known as plagiarism.  (Unless DNA himself
 decides to write it for us!)

 In general, please do NOT copy other people's work or ideas.  We don't want
 the project stopped because we violated some silly copyright law!


 3.2  So where can I get article ideas then?
 -------------------------------------------
 We have a PGG Idea Bank, chock full of great ideas that beg for exploring.
 They're frequently posted to the alt.galactic-guide newsgroup, and all are
 available on-line at the Mothership.

 When posting an idea, be sure to include your name and email address for
 proper credit down the road.  Conversely, when using an idea, just go ahead
 and write your article and credit the idea's originator in the header
 information.


 3.3  The article lifecycle
 --------------------------
 This describes what your Friendly Neighbourhood PGG Editor does and presents
 "a day in the life of an article" so to speak.  Erm, actually, the articles
 themselves don't really speak much; that's just an expression, so let's
 carry on.

 1) A young, up-and-coming comedian/researcher/student/author/human/whatever
    stumbles across, gets hit with, becomes infected by, is arrested in, or
    otherwise has a great idea for an article (or consults the Ideabank,
    which is sometimes less painful).

    She/he/it/they then write an article about the person/place/thing and
    send the article to an editor via email.  (Please see Section 2.1,
    above, for info on who the editors are and where to send stuff.)

 2) The editor send a message back to the author, stating something like:
    "Blah blah, thanks for the article, blah blah blah, I'll edit it for
    format and stuff, blah blah, you'll get it back pretty soon for author
    confirmation, blah blah, give me all your money, etc. etc."

    This message is the author's "receipt" that the editor received the
    article submission.  If you don't get one of these, then the editor
    hasn't received your article yet!

 4) The editor edits the article and performs routine grammar and spell-
    checker things on the article.  Note: if the editor thinks that the
    article (1) violates a copyright law, (2) is a copy of other work, or
    (3) is hopelessly lame, the editor may nix the article for good.

 5) Assuming that everything is fine with the article, the editor then sends
    it back to the author for "author confirmation."  (This is often times
    abbreviated as A/C.  Humm, if the author and the editor had a Direct
    Connection, would this be AC/DC?)

 6) The author reviews the modified article, and then lets the editor know
    that things are alright.  If the author has additional changes with the
    article, they go back to step one and start over.

 7) Once the article is approved, the editor assigns the unique Article ID
    information and sends the article to the PGG Librarian.  The Librarian
    adds the approved article into the article archives and posts the
    article to alt.galactic-guide.


 4.0  The PGG Mothership
 -----------------------
 The Mothership is an Anonymous FTP site where you can download PGG info,
 articles, programs, t-shirt images, reports, and other great stuff.  To
 get to the PGG Mothership, FTP to the following site:

      Lexical:    vela.acs.oakland.edu
      Numeric:    141.210.10.2
      URL:        ftp://vela.acs.oakland.edu/pub/galactic-guide

 When you connect, use the [ anonymous ] user ID and specify your full
 Internet email address as the password.

 The Mothership is [ pub/galactic-guide ], which is actually just a link
 to [ pub/swbaker ].  Thus, if you're using an FTP server which doesn't show
 the logical links, go into the [ swbaker ] directory.

 Anyway, beneath this directory are additional directories for each of
 the particular computer programs and general Hitchhiker's Guide fan stuff.
 There is a separate FAQ file on the PGG Mothership which describes these
 directories and the files they contain in more detail.


 4.1  Mothership mirror sites
 ----------------------------
 If having all of the PGG archives, programs, gif files, and other goodies
 at one centralized location isn't good enough for you, you may be pleased
 to know that it isn't!  That is to say, the stuff is available from more
 than one Anonymous FTP site.

 The PGG Mothership is mirrored at:

      Lexical:     ftp.cs.city.ac.uk
      Numeric:     138.40.91.9
      URL:         ftp://ftp.cs.city.ac.uk/pub/galactic-guide


 4.2  Supported computer platforms
 ---------------------------------
 While having the articles themselves is pretty fun, actually being able to
 do something with them is even better.  The following computer platforms
 are supported with PGG article reader systems:

      o  Acorn Archimedes
         Author contact: Alex McLintock (alexmc@biccdc.co.uk)

      o  Amiga

      o  Atari ST

      o  IBM/MS-DOS (also works within Windows, OS/2, DESQview, etc.)
         Author contact: Steve Baker (swbaker@vela.acs.oakland.edu)

      o  Macintosh
         Author contact: Rickard Andersson (rickard@softlab.se)

      o  Unix
         Author contact: Dave Gymer (dpg@cs.nott.ac.uk)

      o  X Windows
         Author contact: David Squire (squizz@cs.curtin.edu.au)

 Each of the programs is available in its own subdirectory on the Mothership.
 Questions about a particular program's use or functionality should be
 directed to the program's author or posted to alt.galactic-guide.


 4.3  Other ways to get PGG materials
 ------------------------------------
 There's a lot of BBS systems that carry Project Galactic Guide stuff.
 Honestly -- I'm positive there's a lot of them... although the FAQ file
 doesn't really reflect this.  Yet.  Just give us some time and soon
 this list will have a lot of numbers.  Really.

      Area/Region       BBS Name                          Number
      ---------------   ------------------------------    ----------------
      Mass., USA        Sea of Noise                      +1 203 886 1441


 In addition, you may contact one of the following hoopy froods who have
 volunteered to distribute PGG materials in their local countries:

      Country           Contact
      ---------------   ------------------------------
      Denmark           Christian Moensted
                        Almindingen 66
                        2860 Soeborg
                        (email: moensted@diku.dk)


 5.0  World-Wide Web (WWW) sites
 -------------------------------
 For those who can view html documents (including users of Mosaic, Cello,
 and WinWeb), there are a number of froody WWW sites:

      URL:       http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~vdmeulen/index.html
      Operator:  Roel van der Meulen

      URL:       http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/pgg/guide.html
      Operator:  Nick Williams

      URL:       http://www.realtime.net/~lthumper/
      Operator:  Jeff Kramer

      URL:       http://www.willamette.edu/pgg/
      Operator:  James Tilton

 These all have links to the Article Archives, the PGG Mothership, format
 and article information, and many have on-line archive search and article
 retrieval capabilities.


 6.0  Miscellaneous questions
 ----------------------------
 Q:  What's with 42, who is Douglas Adams, and why should I carry a towel?
 A:  Please see the alt.fan.douglas-adams Usenet group; they'll be happy to
     supply you with amplitudes of answers.

 Q:  How can I get a PGG Press Card?
 A:  As soon as they're finished, you'll be able to get an Official PGG
     Press Card from Jason Kohles (jason.kohles@m.cc.utah.edu).

 Q:  What good are the PGG Press Cards?
 A:  They may actually get you in some places, and besides they look cool.
     There's an article on what to do with your Press Card; check it out!

 Q:  What's up with the PGG t-shirts?
 A:  Among others, Stephane Lussier (stef@phoque.info.uqam.ca) has come
     up with some great graphics and motif ideas for the Official PGG
     t-shirt.  They're available for review on the Mothership.  As soon as
     we decide on how the shirts will look, and as soon as someone makes
     the shirts, then you'll be able to order them!  For more information,
     just follow the t-shirt threads on alt.galactic-guide.

 Q:  Do you need more editors?
 A:  Not really.  How can you become an editor?  Well, lots of money would
     definitely help (just kidding).  Anyway, until the project completely
     consumes both Paul and Steve to the point of exhaustion, we're probably
     all set.

 Q:  Is there a Macintosh Guide Reader?

        Employment Background Checks: A Jobseeker's Guide

 **Why would an employer want to do a background check?

 Whether you are hired or promoted for a job may depend on the information
 gathered by the employer in a background check.  Employers use them to
 verify the accuracy of information provided by jobseekers. Background
 reports may also uncover information left out of the application or
 interview.

 Today, more employers are being sued for "negligent hiring" for not checking
 carefully enough into the background of a potential employee. If an
 employee's action hurts someone, the employer may be liable. That is one
 reason more background checks are being conducted.

 The "information age" also accounts for the increase in background checks--
 the availability of computer databases containing millions of records of
 personal data. As the cost of searching these sources drops, employers are
 finding it more feasible to conduct background checks.

 **I don't have anything to hide. Why should I worry?

 While some people are not concerned about background investigations, others
 are uncomfortable with the idea of an investigator poking around in their
 personal history. In-depth background checks could unearth information
 that is irrelevant, taken out of context or just plain wrong.

 A further concern is that the report might include information that is
 illegal to use for hiring purposes or which comes from questionable
 sources. Since in most cases employers are not required to tell applicants
 that a background check is being done, jobseekers may not have the
 opportunity to respond to negative or misleading data.

 **What types of information might be included in a background check?

 Background reports can range from a verification of an applicant's Social
 Security number to a detailed account of the potential employee's history
 and acquaintances. Here are some of the pieces of information that might be
 included in a background check:

 - Driving records   - Vehicle registration   - Credit records
 - Criminal records  - Social Security no.    - Education records
 - Court records     - Workers' compensation  - Bankruptcy
 - Character references   - Neighbor interviews    - Medical records
 - Property ownership     - Employment verification
 - Military service records   - State licensing records

 **Which companies conduct background checks?

 There are many companies that specialize in conducting pre-employment
 background checks. They typically use public records databases to compile
 reports. The following is a partial list of companies that perform a
 variety of services for employment background checking: Avert, Interfact,
 Equifax Employment Services, CDB Infotek, Employers Mutual Assoc.,
 Employers Information Service, Trans Union, Information Resource
 Service Co.,  Pinkerton Security & Investigation Services.

 With the information age upon us, it is easier for employers to gather
 background information themselves. Much of it is computerized, allowing
 employers to "log on" to public records and commercial databases directly
 through commercial online services.

 Employers may also create a "clearinghouse" of information about potential
 employees. A group of employers establish a data exchange program to screen
 applicants. The database is comprised of information submitted by the member
 companies about their employees. When a jobseeker submits an application
 to a member company, that employer will check with the clearinghouse for
 information on the applicant.

 **What types of information *can't* the employer consider?

 Federal and state laws limit the types of information employers can use in
 hiring decisions.

 o Arrest information. Although arrest record information is public record,
 in California employers cannot seek out the arrest record of a potential
 employee. However, if the arrest resulted in a conviction, or if the
 applicant is out of jail but pending trial, that information can be used.
 (California Labor Code @ 432.7)

 o Criminal history. In California, criminal histories or "rap sheets"
 compiled by law enforcement agencies are not public record. Only certain
 employers such as public utilities, law enforcement, security guard firms,
 and child care facilities have access to this information. With the advent
 of computerized court records and arrest information, however, there are
 private companies that compile virtual "rap sheets." (California Penal Code
 @@ 11105, 13300)

 o Workers' compensation. When an employee's claim goes through the state
 system or the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, the case becomes public
 record. Only if an injury might interfere with one's ability to perform
 required duties may an employer use this information. Under the federal
 Americans with Disabilities Act, employers cannot use medical information
 or the fact an applicant filed a workers' compensation claim to
 discriminate against applicants. (42 USC @12101)

 o Bankruptcies. Bankruptcies are public record. However, employers cannot
 discriminate against applicants because they have filed for bankruptcy.
 (11 USC @525)

 **Aren't some of my personal records confidential?

 The following types of information may be useful for an employer to make a
 hiring decision. However, the employer is required to get your permission
 before obtaining the records. (For more information, see PRC Fact Sheet
 No. 11, "From Cradle to Grave: Government Records and Your Privacy.")

 o Education records. Under both federal and California law, transcripts,
 recommendations, discipline records and financial information are
 confidential. A school should not release student records without the
 authorization of the student or parent. However, a school may release
 *directory information*, which can include name, address, dates of
 attendance, degrees earned, and activities, unless the student has given
 written notice otherwise. (California Education Code @@ 67100, 76200;
 20 USC @1232g)

 o Military service records. Under the federal Privacy Act, service records
 are confidential and can only be released under limited circumstances.
 Inquiries must be made under the Freedom of Information Act. Even without
 the applicant's consent, the military may release name, rank, salary, duty
 assignments, awards and duty status. (5 USC @@ 552, 552a)

 o Medical records. In California, medical records are confidential.  There
 are only a few instances when a medical record can be released without your
 knowledge or authorization. If employers require physical examinations
 after they make a job offer, they have access to the results. The Americans
 with Disabilities Act allows a potential employer to inquire only about
 your ability to perform specific job functions. (California Civil Code @
 56.10;42 USC @12101)

 There are other types of questions such as age and marital status and
 certain psychological tests that employers cannot use when interviewing.
 These issues are beyond the scope of this fact sheet. If you have further
 questions, look under "For more information" at the end of this fact sheet
 or call the PRC Hotline.

 **What can my former employer say about me?

 Often a potential employer will contact an applicant's past employers. A
 former boss can say anything [truthful] about your performance. However,
 most employers have a policy to only confirm dates of employment, final
 salary, and other limited information. California law prohibits employers
 from intentionally interfering with former employees' attempts to find jobs
 by giving out false or misleading references. (California Labor Code @ 1050)

 Documents in your personnel file are not confidential and can be revealed
 by an employer. Only medical information in a personnel file is
 confidential.  If you are a state or federal employee, however, your
 personnel file is protected under the California Information Practices Act
 or the federal Privacy Act of 1974 and can only be disclosed under limited
 circumstances.  Under California law, employees have a right to review
 their own personnel files, and make copies of documents they have signed.
 (California Civil Code @ 56.20; California Labor Code @@432, 1198.5;
 California Government Code @ 1798; 5 USC @552a)

 **Does the applicant have a right to be told when a background check is
 requested?

 The *only* times an applicant must be told if a background check is
 conducted is if the employer requests an "investigative consumer report"
 or a credit report. The investigative consumer report may contain
 information about your character, general reputation, personal
 characteristics and lifestyle. The information in the report is typically
 compiled from interviews with neighbors, friends, associates and others who
 might have information about you.

 Under both California and federal law, the applicant must be notified if
 an employer requests an investigative consumer report. (California Civil
 Code @ 1786; 12 USC @1681d. Also see Fact Sheet No. 6, "How Private is My
 Credit Report?")

 An employer can also order a copy of your credit report, which is less
 detailed than an investigative report. However, a credit report can still
 tell an employer a lot about you. It may contain public records information
 such as court cases, judgments, bankruptcies and liens; also, outstanding
 credit accounts and loans, and the payment history for each account. Credit
 report entries remain in the report for up to ten years.

 In California, if an employer checks your credit file, you must be notified
 and given an opportunity to see the file. Also, when a report is requested
 for employment purposes, the credit bureau must block all references to age,
 marital status, race, religion and medical information. Although federal
 and state laws allow credit bureaus to include criminal record information,
 it is an industry policy not to do so. (California Civil Code @@ 1785.18,
 1785.20.5)

 **What can the job applicant do to prepare?

 Although you cannot *prevent* an employer from doing a background check,
 you can take steps to be ready for questions the employer might ask once
 the investigation is conducted.

 o Order a copy of your credit report. If there is something you do not
 recognize or that you disagree with, dispute the information with the
 creditor or credit bureau before you have to explain it to the interviewer.
 (See PRC Fact Sheet No. 6, "How Private is My Credit Report?")

 o Check public records files. If you have an arrest record or have been
 involved in court cases, go to the county where this took place and inspect
 the files. Make sure the information is correct and up to date. Request a
 copy of your driving record from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV),
 especially if you are applying for a job that may involve driving.

 o Ask to see a copy of your personnel file from your old job. Even if you
 do not work there anymore, you have a right to see your file until at least
 a year from the last date of employment. You are allowed to make copies of
 documents in your file that have your signature on them. (California Labor
 Code @ 432.) You may also want to ask if your former employer has a policy
 about the release of personnel records. Many companies limit the amount of
 information they disclose.

 o Read the fine print carefully. When you sign a job application, you may
 also be signing a statement that waives your right to a copy of your credit
 report. You might also be authorizing the disclosure of other personal
 data, such as educational records, medical records and financial data.
 Unfortunately, jobseekers are in an awkward position, since refusing to
 authorize a background check may jeopardize the chances of getting the job.

 o Tell neighbors and work colleagues, past and present, that they might
 be asked to provide information about you. This helps avoid suspicion and
 alerts you to possible problems.

 o If you feel comfortable, ask the interviewer about the company's employee
 privacy policies. Find out if the potential employer plans to do a
 background check, and ask to see a copy.
