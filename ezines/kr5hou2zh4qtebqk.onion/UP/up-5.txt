<*> Underground Periodical, read by the FBI, feared and revered by the
masses. Another month goes by and many more people have helped out as
usual :). Another distributor climbs aboard, thanks tGb, if you want to
be like him then get uploading right now. Well, I'm finally started
to get recognised by people on IRC, lots of people talk just to say
hello, point out minor mistakes in articles or tell me their ideas,
all of which are much appreciated. 

<*> Well, we received many applications for the role of Webmaster, all
were impressive, but a friend convinced me that it would be better to
stay independent. We gave the site a minor overhaul, its a little bit
more slick but still needs work. So now we all help out with the site,
expect more changes and additions over the coming months. We'd still
like suggestions for ways to improve the site. Keep sending those
helpful emails.

<*> We'd like to thank any and all people who submitted to issue five
or contributed in any way. They are the people who go out of their way
to help others. Without continued support from the underground
community we won't be able to keep on going. It's your magazine, so
help it out a little. Anyway, on with this issue...

<*> MY FIRST DXM TRIP
    by DrnknMnky

 "Use your powers for good, not for evil.  Well, you
  can use them for evil if you want, but it voids
  your warranty."

Dec. 1, 1998

Subject:        Male
                140lb (63kg)
                19 yrs

Location:       Tiny dorm room in SK, Canada
                Bathroom across the hall

Prev Exp:       Pot, oil, alcohol

Dosage:         150ml bottle of Delsym DXM
                Ingredients are dextromethorphan polistirex (900mg)

At 5:30p I ate a ham sandwich and some cookies.  I didn't wasn't sure
if I was going to do this tonight or not. I finished reading the DXM
FAQ and about 200 reports, so I figured I was ready.

   At 7:00 I diluted about 1/2 the bottle (450mg) of Delsym in some
water and gulped it down. It was actually pretty good. I started up a
journal to record what I was feeling. I also took a few puffs of
Berotec (asthma inhalor), just in case.

   I got out some CDs and a blacklight, my stomach gurgled a bit and
felt a bit tight, but not nauseous at all. I played around some more on
the computer.

   At 8:15 I started feeling lightheaded, but by 8:30 it went away. I 
decided to finish off the bottle, so I now had 900mg in me.

   At about 9:00 I started feeling drunk, goofy, then mellow and nice.
By 10:00 I was feeling very stoned and time was slow. I talked on IRC a
bit and took out my contacts because they were bugging me. I laid on
the floor and looked at the ceiling, listening to music. I was
listening to Tool, but I took it out and put in underworld. The stucco
ceiling looked all sparkly with the blacklight on. After enjoying the
buzz for about an hour, I had to go to the bathroom.  I felt ok enough
to handle it. Unfortunately, I haven't been stoned in a long time and
forgot how to handle it in public.  

   I opened the door to go across the hall to the bathroom. There were
two guys standing about 5 feet down the hall talking about something.
Don't ask me why but I did panic and sorta jumped across the hall into
the bathroom and shut the door. Later, when I came out, they were gone.

   For some strange reason I had an urge to phone my girlfriend. She
had no clue I was doing anything like this. She is straight, doesn't
even smoke.

Luckily, she is very open minded. We talked for about 15min, and then I
told her what I was doing. (This stuff must be truth serum!) She was a
bit scared, but I told her I had researched it and everything. I
started to explain the reason I was doing this, etc. when I peaked.

   I don't remember much of what happened then. Lots of CEV. Energy 
clouds, flowing strands of colour, everything. A big weird triangle,
blue, green, black, pink...

   Somehow we started talking about life, the universe, and everything
over the phone, I was definetly 'at oneing' what I felt & saw I told
her, what she said back got incorporated into what I was seeing, we
started connecting on a spiritual/mental/psychic level. I could see the
two of us as big jellyfish made of energy (like Abyss).  I could see
the whole network of consciousness, and God was a huge blue stand of
energy that connected everything together. It was cool. It was
definetly a religious experience, and I'm not even that religious. One
thing was clear to me, however, there is a supreme power.

   "I have no idea what happened - blue green mesh mold network - 
                                                 connected - GOD wow."

One thing that I realized, is that everything was planned out through
fate. Everything from the day I met her, to when I found out about DXM,
to this day that I decided to try it, was utterly planned out.

   About 1 1/2 hrs (1hr after I peaked) into the conversation I started
coming down enough to ask "what the fuck just happened?". Both of us
still don't know, but both of our perceptions of life have changed
drastically.

   We talked for 2 1/2 hrs.  That's going to be one massive phonebill
:( After I hung up, I felt extreme deja vu, like I knew this place...

   "This is the real reality, this is where I live."

   I think I laid in bed now, and just thought. No more CEV's. I got
up to go to the bathroom.

   At 1:44 AM I was "walking around like a tank" (I think I was walking
around my room on my toes for a bit). When I walked down the hall to
the second bathroom (first was being used) I felt like I was walking
like a toy soldier, sticking my feet way out. Seemed like I was in a
Busta Rhymes video.

   My pupils were huge, and my left was bigger than the right (doesn't
this mean hemmorhaging or something).

   At 2:00, I laid in bed and thought.  I might have drifted in and
out of sleep.  I noticed my eyes were taking 2-3 sec. to look at things
after I looked at them.  Like, I'd try to look at the desk, and then my
eyes would slowly track up to the desk.  I think I fell asleep at about
4:00.

   At 7:00am I woke up and noticed my eyes were still doing the same
thing. Still pretty stoned.

   At 12:00 I woke up again. Everything was back to normal. I had a
slight headache that went away as soon as I drank something. For the
rest of the day, I've felt sort of warm and nice, and more solid and
grounded. I haven't eaten all day, but I'm not really hungry. I just
want to lay in bed and read.

   I've talked to my GF, and our relationship is definetly on a higher
level now, so that worked out pretty good (don't try this at home).

   It was definetly a good trip. I'm thinking mid/high second plateau.
Most of the things I saw came from things either one of us said. I
didn't lose any idea of identity or location. I didn't get nauseous
(but I have a very strong stomach), no itching, etc. I came down with
some new perspectives, beliefs and a stronger relationship with my GF.

   Will I do it again? Probably, but not for a while, I have finals,
etc. coming up. This seems for me like something every once in a while
when I'm feeling like exploring.

By Tr10n1x of #HackUK on Undernet.

How to get free calls from a payphone, without pissing about with tone
generators, redboxen and such like. The best thing about this is that
you don't need to ring operators, so they can't trace you. In fact, the
only way people know what's going on is if they compare the phone bill
for the box with the amount of money in the tray, hardly likely that a
BT employee will be able (or bothered) to add-up anyway.

Ok, first, you need a shit old phone. Cut the lead connecting the phone
to the phone jack. Get some crocodile clips and connect them to the
red/blue wires, or the yellow/black wires, depending on the age of your
phone. Don't worry if none of your wires are those colours, just
because YOU'VE GOT A FREAK PHONE THAT'S CRAP AND NO-ONE'S EVER HEARD OF
AND IS SHIT, doesn't mean you can't get free calls from it ;) If you
have got a freak phone, experiment by connecting each wire back up to
the original (before you cut it), and see which 2 wires give you a
dialtone. Attach the croc. clips to those. Right, you now have a beige
box, or linesman's handset. I call mine a glasses box, because I
dismantled my phone and put it into a much smaller container, a glasses
case, to prevent prying eyes wondering what I'm doing with a separate
phone in a phone box. You might want to disguise yours too, if you're
planning to use a phonebox in urban areas (not recommended).

Next, you need to go outside <SHOCK, HORROR, SUNLIGHT, NO COMPUTER!>
and hunt for the right kind of phone box. Don't even think about going
anywhere near the new glass phone boxes, because you've no chance, AND
they're always in highly public areas, so you're a prick if you plan to
use them :) You're looking for an OLD red payphone. Found one? go
inside, and look at the floor underneath the money box. You see a big
metal triangle on the wall of the box, with a metal tube going up to
the phone. Get a hammer and wrench this casing tube off. You'll now
have a wire. Pull this out from around the back of the money box.
Eventually, this cable will meet with a white phone line. They'll be
connected by two wires, (if there are lots, you want the blue and
orange ones). Strip the wires back partially (about 1/2 a centimetre)
and attach your crocodile clips from YOUR phone to them. Check that you
have a dialtone, and BINGO! Free calls, paid for by BT. When you're
done, tuck the wires back where they were, so people don't think it's
been tampered with. Oh, one last thing, NEVER call home unless it's an
emergency, and ALWAYS dial 141 before all calls, that stops Big Brother
from tracing you.

Welcome. Are you pissed off with paying for calls? Me too. Are you
pissed off with shit blueboxing files? Me too. That's why I've written
this text. The basic structure of a blueboxing file goes:

                       Here is how to bluebox
                   Here are the tones you'll need
                          Go get Bluebeep
                          Find a C5 line
                            EXPERIMENT

The one that really pissed me off was the last one. Experiment.
Frankly, I don't want to. I want to be able to bluebox straight away,
no questions asked. I imagine that's how you feel, so I'll teach you.

First, what is blueboxing?

Blueboxing is possibly the most commonly used skill in the phreaking
community. Or at least, it was. Don't worry, it's not extinct, that's
bullshit. It started in the US (quelle suprise?), when phreaks got
tired of paying for calls. They found out that if they sent 2600hz
down the phone line to a local number they'd already dialed, they
could dial any number they want in the world, all for the cost of a
local call. It used to work here, but no longer. Which, in a way is a
good thing, because now it means we don't have to pay the local call
either, it's all free. Basically, the 2600hz tone told the fone company
'This person's hung up, stop charging them'. And from there, the phreak
could call anywhere. It's called blueboxing because there used to be a
little box that made the tones needed, and funnily enough, it was blue.
Anyway, in the UK it's a little more complicated.

What do I need to bluebox?

The program found at hackuk.8m.com, S|ain's UK tone Emulator.
A soundcard. A phone near your soundcard. A C5 number.

A what number?

A C5 number, it's an undeveloped phone line that still thinks certain
tones mean the caller has hung up. They are usually 0800 890 ***, and
they connect to various poor countries. I know of two that are
currently useable, the first being one I can't get to work, Uraguay
direct, and the second, the one I use, Bolivia Direct (0800 890 059).
If it packs up, just go to the back of your phonebook and you'll find
more there. You'll know they're C5, as there'll be a high-pitched CHEEP
CHEEP when the other end picks up. Bolivia is especially good, as it is
automated, so no operators will get pissed off with you, trace you,
send you to prison and get your parents/guardians (see how Politically
Correct I am?) pissed with you so they disown you. Which they can do,
by the way, in case you're thinking of calling Bolivia direct without
dialing 141 first. Not that that'll save you anyway. 

I'm sorted, now what?

Dial the number, wait about 5 secs, and you'll hear a cheep cheep,
followed by some Bolivian speaking to you (It's automated, don't worry,
they won't laugh at you when they realise you've failed miserably and
start bleeping at them). That step's to make sure you know what your
dialing, and that you've dialed it right. Hang up.

Ok...and now?

Open S|ain's program. Click on Blue Box. Ignore what's written on the
buttons, it's wrong. Press all the buttons to make sure they're
working. Keep this program open.

Right, get on with it, I want free calls! FUCKING WAIT. Pick up your
phone and call Bolivia (0800 890 059). Put your phone next to the
speaker from which your tones flow out. Press the button (on the
program) marked '2400/2400 mix'. Now press '2400 hz'. Hold the phone to
your ear. If you hear a long bleep, you've fucked up, you've got to
press 2400 hz really quickly. If you hear nothing, good. Put the phone
back to the speaker, and press KP now dial the number you want to call
(inc. country and area code). Press ST. You're there, the call's being
connected.

A basic summary of what to press

0800 890 059--> 2400/2400 mix--> 2400 hz--> KP--> Country Code--> Area Code--> Number--> ST

Ok, redboxing. This takes more guts than blueboxing, but not much, you
just need social engineering skills (the ability to persuade someone to
give you what you want). For more info about social engineering, just
ask Mister-X ;) Right, first, what do you need?

Things you'll need:

              S|ain's UK box emulator at hackuk.8m.com
                 A tape recorder (dictaphone ideal)
                            A walkman
                 A small (walkman headphone) speaker
                           A phone box

OK, set up your dictaphone or tape recorder to record from your PC onto
either. The recording MUST be clear, but I'll leave that to you. Load
up S|ain's UK box emulator. Click on Redbox. Start recording on your
tape player/dictaphone. Click on the 50p button. Wait 2 seconds, then
click on 50p again. Repeat this until you've got enough for the call
you want to make. But the tape in you walkman, and plug in the speaker.

Go down to your local telephone box. 

Next step, dealing with the operator. Putting money into a phone box
creates tones. The only way an operator knows you've put in money is if
they hear these tones. These tones are the ones you've just recorded :)
Decide where you want to call. First, dial 155 to report a fault to the
operator. Say that you can't call a number, because the (whatever)
button is broken. Operator will ask you to insert money. Here, you play
the tones back to them. They'll then connect you. You now have free
calls!

Bad things to do:

Decide you're calling 0891 33 99 55 and tell them the '7' button's
broken. Be rude to them. Be mouthy. Tell them what to do, they're an
operator, it's their job, if you tell them what to do, they won't.

Bye and stuff:

<*> The wonderful and evil world of e-mail
<*> The art of e-mail forging and tracing explained in one simple text

This is my second article on hacking my first being the ethics of a
true hacker which is available on my web site at
http://mobboss.dragx.cx. This article will touch on the subject of mail
forgery and tracing. Please beware any info learned this article is to
be used only for the purposes of information and not wrong doing. The
Mob Boss will in no way be responsible for your stupidity. Now on with
the article. Now there has been several guides written about this on
the internet yet a lot of people still don't understand or haven't read
about it yet. Most of the guides fail to show you how to find a willing
server as well since that is the major problem these days.

 I. Forgery

 - E-mail forging, how is this done?

	This is quite easy to do as long as you can type and boot up
telnet. Telnet is a program for connecting to remote hosts and it ships
with Windows 9x and all distros of UNIX. To run this program simply
go to run then telnet or the DOS prompt then simply type telnet while
in the c:\windows. That's simple enough and I hope that every newbie
hacker who is running windows becomes good friends with telnet because
if you want to ever want to hack your going to do it through it telnet
that is for sure when you are running Windows for your main operating
system. Now the second step is connecting to a remote host, the
computer you want to do this from. Now I will almost guarantee on your
first shot you will not get to forge mail your first time because over
the years security has become better and sysadmins are stopping the
routing of mail. Anyways, click file and then remote host. This brings
up a box in which you choose a port and a host. Now for port notice
that a default value of telnet is in there. Thats' the equivalent of
port 23. That is used to physically log into a system such as into your
ISP shell account which allows you to give UNIX commands to one of your
ISP's computers.

We won't be working with that default port, the telnet one, we will be
working with port 25 the standard SMTP port which is the port that
sends out mail. This is the port which mail forging, mail bombers, and
those sendmail exploits you see so much of occur on. So lets begin by
choosing a host and then a port 25. Now if this doesn't work on the
first computer don't get discouraged that's the best trait a hacker can
display, persistence. Now when we telnet in we will be displayed with a
welcome message which will have the computer's name and hostname. It
will be followed by the daemon software they are using usually
sendmail, which runs on a UNIX platform and is to say the least an
intruders best friend in gaining root. Now the second step is to greet
the computer (they have feelings too you know):

helo Dreamer.Foobar.com

Then the computer will say hello and will display where they logged you
from. The next thing to do is to specify a return address. For this put
in any god damn thing you want, remember you are in control
muhahahahahah:

mail from: President@whitehouse.gov

Now if everything goes according to plan and the machine allows routing
well then bingo you won the booby prize. But were getting ahead of
ourselves there is still another crucial step. We have to specify a
recipient which will tell us whether or not this computer wants to be
our friend or not:

rcpt to: Lewinsky@interns.com

Now if you get a message such as "Sorry routing not allowed" well then
you're out of luck and move onto the next machine. But if it excepts it
then you have found that trusting machine. Notice on the different
machines how the message, "Routing denied", can vary in its tone and
pleasantness. Anyways on to the next step the body of the message: data

This tells the computer you are ready to write the message. It will
then say enter your message and end by hitting enter, then a period by
its self and enter.

Hey Monica, my place or yours?

Then it will say message excepted for delivery. Just enter the command
exit and it will close you out of the system. It's that simple. 

 - What the hell is this any use for?

This is one of those most basic and helpful hacks you can learn.
Whether you aspire to be an evil criminal, or in the words of Carolyn
Meinel, a whitehat hacker then you need to know this. It gives you some
practice in a command line atmosphere where all the real hacking takes
place, very little is or can be done in a graphical windows interface.
Now the other thing this is good for is if you are a eager beaver when
it comes to social engineering. The wonderful things that could be done
with an e-mail appearing to be from system administration. Another
handy thing is that this can be used as an impressive trick to show
your friends who are clueless in AOL la la land. They'll find this very
impressive. If you have ever used a mail bomber maybe you'll remember
it asking for a server and it allowed you to send e-mail from any 
address. This is all because it uses the same principle that we have
learned today. As you can see this is quite useful for a variety of
things and is something every inspiring hacker should learn.

 - WHAT THE FUCK!? It won't let me route or something?

Ok now, calm down. The reason is because the sysadmin at the computer
you were trying to telnet into and forge from is smarter then the
average bear. But this is the MOB BOSS your talking too so of course
I'll give you some hints on how to find open boxes. First of all don't
attempt this on any military computers all you 31337 hacker buffs,
unless you enjoy being interrogated (though I should write an article
on that). Now after you narrow that down try to forget about government
computers like courthouses and state agencies. Although there are some
good boxes, it's a unnessecary risk. Your best bet will definitely be
*.edu servers. Colleges and Universities have the most lazy security
although I have found some very secure computers at those places of
learning. A good place to start looking is on a search engine such as
altavista (www.altavista.com). From there, pour yourself a big cup of
coffee and prepare for some searching. Look up universities and
colleges. There are so many variations you can do, its pathetic. Now
make a nice long list of them and then once you have a fair amount
hosts start telneting.

This might be a happy or discouraging moment but no matter what don't
give up. Persistence will beat all, at least most of the time. Take a
look at the versions of sendmail, those computers that are paying off
are usually old dusty versions huh? Anyways I have found this the best
way to look. Now these can be used for a variety of purposes.
Mail bombing and mail forging alike but under all circumstances be sure
not to use one server too much. This can piss of a sysadmin royally
especially if you and a buddy are being idiots and using his computers
to mailbomb constantly. If you do idiotic things like this expect your
ISP to find out and kick your ass off. Now since good ISP's are hard to
come by these days this might be a royal pain in the ass so watch
yourself. Now once you have a few computers which route go trade with
friends who do the same or in chat rooms. Expect that they'll want
something in return though. Nothing is free.

II. Tracing e-mail 

 - What's the point?

Well ever want to get revenge on that spammer or the schmuck who
bombed you well tracing the messages back to the idiots ISP is a good
start. Now also I have had many attempts on my accounts with trojans
and viruses but once I spotted the mini intruders I traced it back to
the ISP and informed his sysadmin. Never had anything else from him
again hahahahahahaha. Also its the best way to scare a stalker or an
abuser. Those threatening e-mails may leave some people helpless but we
are hackers so we take action. The hunted becomes the hunter. This can
all be done by turning an e-mail and tracing it.

 - Ok sounds good so how is it done?
	
First step is to check out the full header. I am way too lazy to tell
you how to do this because its in the manual but I'll tell you right
now on web based e-mail the option for full headers is usually in
options although on hotmail I hit reply and the header is right there.
Ask your tech support people if you can't figure it out yourself.
Anyways in that header there is a variety of info there that we want to
know. There are two main things you want to know though. The biggest is
going to be mail received from thing. Its here where you want to look
for an IP address. One you have that its time to DNS that. If you have
a shell account go to it and do nslookup IP addy. Once you get the
servers name you'll do a whois query. Hopefully your target has a small
ISP or university account. If this is true you will know his state and
possibly town. Using this info casually in an e-mail to him will make
him worry.

Also you will know have the power to inform the sysadmin of the IP addy
and exact time it was sent. This is so simple yet very few people do
it. My suggestion is to look at all full headers you can. It will give
you addresses to telnet into look around and will also give you the
power to know exactly who the son of a bitch is. Now if you want to be
really slick you might have one of those Yahoo accounts and will be
informed immediately of any new mail which was just sent then you'll
have his current IP hahahahaha. This might be the perfect time to
attack. Teach the guy a lesson if you must or turn him in its up to
you. Practice this techniques you never know when it'll come in handy.

<*>              Getting Free Dial-Ups From Free CDs
                +-----------------------------------+

INTRO
-----

Most ISPs are freely willing to send you their sign-up CDs in the post
or they've got their files on cover CDs freely available from your
newsagents. The other similarity that most ISPs have is that they
distribute Internet Explorer to their customers as the default browser.
To do this easily they use IEAK (Internet Explorer Admin Kit) which is
freely available from the Microsoft site and is used to produce full
installation packages for ISPs.

Right, enough of the background...

IE4
---

The installations are often in their own directory called IE4 or
similar and are normally made up of a bunch of .CAB (Microsoft's
compressed files) and a few other executables. If you can't see these
in your IE4 directory then make sure you've got the latest version of
WinZip and right click on executable file in the directory that looks
like IE4, if you're lucky then it will have an "Open with WinZip"
option which allows you to open the installations file's built in files
and extract them without installing them. If you still can't find the
IE4 install files then you're in the wrong directory or your ISP's got
wise, but this is rare and they're normally easy to find.

In these install files is at least one .isp file which is normally
called setup.isp (although the name isn't set, make sure you're not
hiding the extensions and use explorer to look for the file). Once
you've found the file hold down shift and right click the file then
choose the "Open With..." option followed by Notepad (Or you're fav.
text viewer!) This .isp file hold all of the information that IE4
install uses to dial into your ISP and sign you up a new account, to
dial into an ISP you need a username and password of course, but
you've not been assigned one yet since you're not a member of your ISP,
so instead IE4 dials into a signup account while IE4 arranges to give
you your password. The user name and password can be found in this .isp
file along with the phone number of your ISPs reg-server.

Depending on how well your ISP's set up there server will depend on
what you can access through this dial-in account, normally it's just a
single URL or server which has the registration process on but if you
strike lucky you'll find an ISP who's security is lame and allows you
to have full internet access through the account, providing you with an
anon, free account. If the ISPs get annoyed and change their password
then simply re-apply for a sign-up CD and pull the password off again!
I can't see there being any change in the IE5 distribution so it looks
like this problem is around to stay :-)

IE3
---

After trawling through zip files it looks like the same trick can be
done with IE3, but from my test install you're gonna need something
which can open install.exe files, like WinZip. The general method is
pretty similar, I played with the netcom install files and here's what
I found, first extract the files from msie30uk.exe or whatever the IE3
install file is. From here you need to open the iexplore.cab file and
extract the contents, these include the set-up info.

The test install had a phone.icw file which held the numbers for the
local dial-ups it also contained pointers to .dun files depending on
the location, opening these up in notepad revealed that these looked
similar to IE4's .isp files containing user and pass info, simply match
these up with the number in phone.icw and happy surfing!

PROBLEMS
--------

The only problem that I've come across while using this method is with
the InfoTrade ISP (Run by Mitsubishi and has numeric user-names, Urgh!)
I sifted through the .isp file, but I couldn't find the username/pass
anywhere, I dialed in through HyperTerminal and sure enough it wanted a
login, but alas there wasn't one anywhere, when I ran the .isp file it
also prompted me for a username/pass, looking through the documentation
it appears that each new subscriber is given a user name and pass to
sign on with that then becomes their permanent account, no why haven't
the rest of the ISP's done this? Simply because they don't treat you as
a number but more of a person so unless you pre-arrange the username
this can't be done, it just goes to show how much difference it takes
to prevent this hole from coming to light!

                       :.Dealing With Payphones:
                       :.:.::..By T|rant..::.:.:

<*> Most of you have seen War Games, right? Remember the part where
David was stranded in Colorado and needed to call his girlfriend in
Seattle? I knew you did. If you didn't, what David done was unscrew the
mouthpiece on the payphone and make some connection between the
mouthpiece and the phone.  Well... that was pretty close to reality
except for two things...

1> Nowadays, mouthpieces are unscrewable.

2> You cannot make long distance or toll calls using that method.

Maybe that DID work on older phones, but you know Ma Bell. She always
has a damn cure for every thing us Phreaks do. She glued on the
mouthpiece!

Now to make free local calls, you need a finishing nail. I highly
recommend "6D E.G. FINISH C/H, 2 INCH" nails. These are about 3/32 of
an inch in diameter and 2 inches long (of course). You will also need
a large size  paper  clip. By large we mean they are about 2 inches
long (FOLDED). Then you unfold the paper clip. Unfold it by taking each
piece and moving it out 90 degrees. When it is done it should look
somewhat like this:

                             /----------\
                             |          |
                             |          |
                             |          |
                             |          |
                             \-----

Now,  on to the neat stuff. What you do, instead of unscrewing the
glued on mouthpiece, is insert the nail into the centre hole of the
mouthpiece (where you talk) and push it in with pressure or just hammer
it in by hitting the nail on something. Just DON'T KILL THE MOUTHPIECE!
You could damage it if you insert the nail too far or at some weird
angle. If  this happens then the other party won't be able to hear what
you say.

You now have a hole in the mouthpiece in which you can easily insert
the paper clip.  So, take out the nail and put in the paper  clip. 
Then take the other end of the paper clip and shove it under the rubber
cord protector at the bottom of the handset (you know, the blue guy..).
This should end up looking remotely like... like this:

                             /----------\      Mouthpiece
                             |          |      /
             Paper clip -->  |          |     / 
                             |      /---|---\
                             |      |   |   |------------>
         ====================\---)))|       |  To earpiece ->
                                    \-------------------->
                   ^              ^
                   |              |
                   |              |
                 Cord          Blue guy

(The paper clip is shoved under the blue guy to make a good connection
between the inside of the mouthpiece and the metal cord.)

Now, dial the number of a local number you wish to call, sayyyy, MCI.
If everything goes okay, it should ring and not answer with the "The
Call You Have Made Requires a 20 Cent Deposit" recording.  After the
other end answers the phone, remove the paper clip. It's all that
simple, see?

There are a couple problems, however. One is, as we mentioned earlier,
the mouthpiece not working after you punch it. If this happens to you,
simply move on to the next payphone. The one you are now on 
is lost. Another problem is that the touch tones won't work when the 
paper clip is in the mouthpiece. There are two ways around this..

A> Dial the first 6 numbers. This should be done without the paper clip
making the connection, i.e. one side should not be connected. Then
connect the paper clip,  hold down the last digit, and slowly pull the
paper clip out at the mouthpiece's end.

B> Don't use the paper clip at all. Keep the nail in after you punch
it. Dial the first 6 digits.  Before dialing the last digit, touch
the nail head to the plate on the main body of the phone,  the money
safe thingy... then press the last number.

The reason that this method is sometimes called clear boxing is because
there is another type of phone which lets you actually make the call
and listen to them say "Hello,  hello?" but it cuts off the mouthpiece
so they can't hear you. The Clear Box is used on that to amplify your
voice signals and send it through the earpiece. If you see how this is
even slightly similar to the method I just described up there, kindly
explain it to ME!! Because I DON'T GET IT!

Anyways, this DOES work on almost all single slot, Dial Tone First
payphones (Pacific Bell for sure). I do it all the time. This is the
least, I STRESS *LEAST*, risky form of Phreaking.  And remember. 
There are other Phreaks like you out there who have read this article
and punch payphones, so look before you punch, and save time.

If you feel the insane desire to have to contact me to bitch at 
me for some really stupid mistake in this article, you can reach me 
in #hackuk on Undernet.

Also,  if you think of any new ideas that can be used in conjunction
with this method, such as calling a wrong number on purpose and
demanding your quarter back from the 0perator, tell me!! Find me on
Undernet or email me. Oh, and if this only works on Pac Bell phones,
tell me also! Thanks for your time.

<*> DAB
<*> Digital Audio Broadcasting....

NOTE:
-=-=-

With the release of this file I am in no way stating that I am an
expert in the radio field but read on if you think it is something that
might interest you...

START:
-=-=-=-

We all by now know that the digital television phase has suddenly taken
over the standard analogue television set's job of giving you you
a standard cable operated amount of channels and turning it into a
multi functional 1000+ channel high quality receiver. Well the second
phase of this digital takeover is now on its way to now give you the
same operation accept this time its on your car radio.

It's called Digital Audio Broadcasting and it's the most fundamental
advance in radio since FM. Now, for the first time, you can tune into
pure CD quality sound over the airwaves. Without interference, fading
or distortion. With more stations and services to choose from. And text
pictures and graphics can be sent to support audio programmes. DAB is
compatible with other digital services, such as the internet. All of
this, in-car. Created in 1987 by a European consortium, DAB (also known
as Eureka 147) is the only system in the world to receive International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) recognition as a world-wide standard,
and the word is spreading fast. DAB services will soon be available
throughout most of the EU. At least 100,000,000 people are already
within reach of DAB transmissions.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

With DAB, the audio signal from each programme is converted into a
stream of digital data bits. This digital data is combined by a
multiplexing technology known as COFDM into one Ensemble - an Ensemble
consists of up to eight principal programmes, as well as additional
programme related data and data for use with ancillary data services.
COFDM spreads the data stream over the time and frequncy spectrum,
eliminating the effects of radio interference. This gives continuous CD
quality sound for uninterrupted listening pleasure. COFDM also enables
the creation of Single Frequency Network (SFN). This allows the
broadcaster to build a network of transmitters, each of which use the
same frequencies. This eliminates the need for retuning, and adds to
the convenience of the DAB service. 

                           
                              -=DAB=-

MULTIPLEXING:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Multiplexing, in terms of digital broadcasting, is the process of
interweaving two or more lower-speed data streams into a single high
speed radio frequency channel, or Ensemble. DAB offers the possibility
of Dynamic Multiplex Reconfiguration. This means that the Ensemble
contents can be adjusted according to the requirements at any time,
allowing a different choice of programmes and services at different
times. For example, the broadcaster can choose to simultaneously cover
a football game and a tennis match, instead of only offering one sports
programme (See Diagram). Broadcasters now have more flexibility in
programming and the listener has more choice. The Ensemble may also
contain Programme Associated Data (PAD), Programme Type (PTY)
information, Dynamic Label Segment (DLS-DAB Text), Language information
and Announcement support information.

<*> Introduction

[Overview]

 Subscriber Units are Customer Line Interfaces, this is where two or
 more phone lines intersect, they are multiplexers which connect up to
 the local switching hub. They are sometimes installed in houses where
 a second phone is placed. Or you may have seen boxes on telephone
 poles where about fifty or more of the phone lines in a neighbourhood
 all join up. The reason for this is convenience, the lineman might
 need all the local lines in one fixed place at his disposal, and you
 probably thought all those commercials on television claiming
 convenience was just some slick telco advertising campaign.

 Ok, I'm not going to bore you with a list of the some telco acronyoms
 and seeing as they are mostly country specific and usually corporate
 speak it would be dull and useless to most people. I'm just going to
 talk a little subscriber units in no great detail. They are largely
 experimented with by the phreaking community due to their high level
 of accessibility, they are outside which makes the possibilities
 endless. For more information head down to the back of your local
 telco yard with a balaclava and backpack or search in your local
 library under telecommunications.

<*> General Information

[Overview]

 Boxes located on the sides of roads to deal with all the lines in that
 area, some subscriber units are full of hundreds of wires for that
 area whereas others can be much smaller. I would recommend having a
 look inside one of these as they are totally full of wires but don't
 get caught opening one of these as you might be arrested! If you open
 one of these subscriber units you can beige box off it, good fun if
 the unit has hundreds of lines in it as you can easily seize lot of
 peoples phone lines and hook up to your laptop. Alternatively, many
 have operator test sockets which you can simply plug your phone cord
 into. All the residential phone lines join into them and are connected
 by fibre optic cables to the local switching exchange.

  /  __     __  \  This is a very rough diagram, especially considering
  | __   __ |  that subscriber units can be big or small, black or
  | __   __ |  green, whatever. It all depends on what country you
  | __   __ |  live in, but aesthetic details such as size and
  | __   __ |  colour are not important, what matters is the phone
  | __   __ |  lines inside. The diagram to the left shows a very
  | __   __ |  general example with seven ring and tip pairs on
  |         |  either side. There are many different kinds of
  \__\\-----//__/  copper pairs each with their own colour coding, but
       |   |       that goes beyond the scope of this file. This ascii
       |   |       diagram is best viewed in the Fixedsys font.

<*> Country Interfaces

[Overview]

 Customer Line Interfaces vary from country to country, size and shape,
 colour and context, many different types and styles. This section is a
 meant as a resource for looking up information on subscriber units in
 a small handful of countries.

[United States]

 A subscriber unit in this country is officially referred to as
 Telephone Line Interfaces but more loosely called BellCans. In most
 states they are small green boxes usually going down into the ground.
 These Junction Boxes (as they are also sometimes called) can be black
 or green depending on which telco administrates them e.g. Bell, GTE,
 MCI, AT&T etc.

[United Kingdom]

 A subscriber unit in this country is called a Cable Access Box (CAB)
 and they are generally big green boxes with the majority fixed by pole
 installation. The newer standard BT models have sockets where the
 phone is plugged into. They are also known as PCPs.

[Spain]

 A subscriber unit in this country is called a Telefonica Rectngulo De
 Ensambladura. That roughly translates as Telefonica Junction Box, it
 is worth noting that Telefonica are the telco that hold the monopoly
 on the Spainish telecommunications market. 

[Ireland]

 A subscriber unit in this country is called a RBM. I'm not sure what
 that stands for but it is a foreign acrynom as Telecom Eireann's RBM
 supplier is Tadiran Communications, a company based in Israel. They
 are small black boxes found on poles etc. They are never buried
 underground. The most common models come in two and four copper pair
 units.

<*> Manual Installation

[Overview]

 Below the overview is instructions for installing a subscriber unit.
 Ok, so maybe most phreaks won't care, but going with the philosophy
 that all knowledge is power I'm going to include it anyway. It is an
 extract from a manual that was given to me along with some other
 interesting items by a friendly lineman. It is supposed to be info
 reserved for telco employees. The official title is Installation
 Instructions For The RBM 2 Subscribers Unit. This particular unit is
 only compatible with European phone systems as far as I know.

[Unpacking]

 1. Open the plastic bag.
 2. Open the RBM housing cover by unscrewing the two slotted screws.

[Wall Installation]

 1. Select an appropriate location on a vertical smooth surface for the
    Subscriber Unit.
 2. Attach the RBM box, using the enclosed screws.

[Pole Installation]

 1. Secure the RBM box to a pole with a flexible strap (not supplied).
 2. Thread the strap through the pair of holes provided on the upper
    and lower parts of the unit and fasten around the pole.

[Wiring]

 1. To insert wires into the box - cut grommet bosses located on the
    front cover and route the wires through.
 2. Strip away approximately 8mm. of wire insulation.
 3. Pull out the connector from its housing.
 4. Insert the wires into the connector (see diagrams), using the
    plastic lever (the plastic lever can be use for all 11 positions).
 5. Replace the connector into its housing.
 6. Close the front cover.

[Inspection]

 1. If the DLX unit is operated and connected to the digital line,
    verify that the green SYNC light is on. This indicates that the RBM
    2 Subscribers Unit is synchronised with the DLX. Note: The light
    will begin to glow within 60 seconds of connector insertion.
 2. If the subscriber lines are connected to the exchange, connect a
    telephone set in parallel with the subscriber connections and
    carry out operational test.

    Vegetable Shortening Bomb
    -------------------------

         Materials:
              Chlorine Bleach or pool chlorine
              Vegetable Shortening

         Procedure:
              Mix the two together and watch the smoke pour out. Don't
              inhale the fumes they are dangerous to your health


    Pipe Bomb
    ---------

         Materials:
              Pipe with threads on one end
              Cap for pipe.
              Paraffin
              Steel disk size of pipe
              Hydrochloric acid

         Procedures:
              Take the pipe crimp one end closed and fill about 3/4
              full of paraffin, poke a number of holes in the paraffin.
              On top of this place the steel disk (**make sure it fits
              around the top of the pipe completely) Put some HCl on
              the disk put cap on set with paraffin end down and get
              the hell away from there. In 2-5 minutes depending on the
              thickness of the disk... it goes kaboom cause the
              pressure builds of from the chemical reaction of the
              paraffin and the acid... the cap or the pipe (whichever
              is stronger) bursts

    Light Bulb Bomb
    ---------------

         Materials:
              Light Bulb
              Drill and Small Bit
              Gasoline
              Some silicon or something to plug a hole in the bulb.

         Procedures:
              Drill a small hole in the bulb fill it 1/2 way with
              gasoline plug the hole with the silicon (or something
              like that) screw it in (with the power off of course) and
              when the person turns it on boom!!!!

    Small Explosive mixtures:
    -------------------------

         Materials:
              Petroleum jelly
              Potassium nitrate

         Procedure:
              Mix the petroleum jelly and potassium nitrate in a one to
              one ratio.  When wet it is harmless... but when it dries
              it is highly explosive and shock sensitive. Store in oil.

         Materials:
              Potassium iodide
              pure iodine
              Ammonium hydroxide [ammonia water 10%]

         Procedures:
              Mix 3 grams of potassium iodide and 5 grams of iodine in
              a beaker with 50 ml. of water.  Then add 20 ml. of
              Ammonium Hydroxide filter this substance and the
              resulting solid is called nitrogen triiodine. When this
              is wet it is safe but when it is dry it is as unstable as
              the last mixture.

    Common Rocket Fuel
    ------------------

         Materials:
              Potassium nitrate
              Powdered sugar

         Procedures:
              Mix the two together in a 1 to 1 ratio.  Then take an old
              sauce pan and melt it. It should turn into a fudgey
              looking compound Pour this into a cardboard tube and put
              a fuse in. Let hardened. It is easier just taking two dry
              ingredients and packing them in a tube or just lighting
              as a powder.  As a powder it makes lots of smoke.

    Chlorite Mixtures
    -----------------
         NOTE: The main ingredient for this experiment is potassium or
         sodium chlorite. Both of these are equally as good.  However,
         both may prove difficult to find.  Probably the only way to
         get it would be to order it through a chemical warehouse.

         Materials:
              Potassium or Sodium Chlorite
              Powdered Charcoal
              Powdered aluminum
              Sulfur

         Procedures:
              Mix sulfur, charcoal, and aluminum in mortar. Grind well
              to make sure the mixture is evenly mixed. Add the
              Chlorite (**Do not grind after the chlorite is added) You
              can use this for many uses smoke bombs, model rocket fuel
              etc.

    Green Goddess
    -------------

         Materials:
              Zinc
              Sulfur

         Procedure:
              Mix the zinc and sulfur in a one to one ratio. To ignite
              use Magnesium and a blow torch.  Matches won't work. (A
              good source of magnesium is sparklers.)

    Nitrate Compound
    ----------------

         Materials:
              Potassium Nitrate
              Aluminum Powder
              Sulfur

         Procedure:
              Mix 2 Tbsps of the Potassium Nitrate, 2 tbsps of Aluminum
              Powder and 1 1/2 tbsps of Sulfur. Put in a container put
              a fuse in it light and throw makes tons of smoke.

         Here are a few tips:
              a.) To make more smoke add more sulfur
              b.) To make it burn slower, add more Potassium Nitrate
              c.) To make it burn faster add more Aluminium

    Missile Launcher
    ----------------

         Materials:
              empty can (gasoline can preferably)
              gasoline
              paper bag
              aluminium foil

         Procedures:
              Cut a piece out of the bag the size of your can.  Roll it
              up cigar-style and tape the very ends to keep it in the
              same shape. Now, take your missile, and stick about
              3/4ths of it in a pool of gasoline, and let it soak a
              little while. Now, on the upper limit where the Gas hit
              rip a small piece almost completely, bend it and twist it
              that's your fuse.  Now put aluminum foil on the top. The
              amount of foil that you put on determines the range of
              the missile. The more the shorter... makes it easier to
              aim.  Put the missile in the hole in the Gas can so that
              the fuse is lightable and light it, and stand back (it
              makes a bit of a noise.

    Car Bomb
    --------

         Materials:
              Tylenol bottle (empty)
              Liquid Drayno
              Heavy wire or solder.

         Instructions:
              Fill the bottle all the way full of liquid drayno. Close
              the bottle wrap some wire or solder around the neck of
              the bottle (to make it sink fast) Slip it in a car's Gas
              tank and run... In about 5-15 minutes *BOOM*

    Fragmentation Grenade
    ---------------------

         Materials:
              Can of Vasoline
              Rusty nails
              A fuse

         Instructions:

              Remove top from can of vasoline and punch a small hole in
              it just big enough for the fuse to fit through. Put the
              rusty nails in the vasoline and put the top back on tape
              the top securely and put the fuse in... light throw and
              run. ***BOOM*** Nails, glass, and burning vasoline all
              over.

                       :..::..By CrossFire.::..:

<*> CrossFire Presents.......

Introduction
------------

AOL Instant Messenger, the tool of lamers worldwide. It's pretty
obvious right from the beginning that AOL don't think much security is
needed. There are several bugs in the aim software that could possibly
lead to compromise of the victim's AOL account.

Password Hashes
---------------

The Hash that AIM uses to "encrypt" passwords is absolutely awful. An
AIM password has to be between 4 and 16 characters, When the AIM client
signs on to the authorizer, the encoded password presented is the same
length as the decoded form. After a bit of working, I discovered the
hash used to encrypt the passwords looks something like this:

 u_char hash[16] = { 243, 179, 108, 153, 149, 63, 172, 182,
                     197, 250, 107, 99, 105, 108, 195, 154 };

The server then just XOR's this hash with the encrypted password and
gets the plain text pass. In other Words:

           for (i = 0; i < 16; i ++)
           crypt_pw = cleartext_pw[i] ^ hash[i];

This data seems to be static, well it is for the AIM Windows Client,
and I believe for the java client too. Now all you need to do is sniff
this users connection to the authorizer, and you have that user's
plain text password.

Cookies
-------

Once the user has been authorised, the server sends it a cookie, to let
it sign on quickly to another service. But what happens if you can get
that cookie? You can steal a user's cookie, flood the user or reset
their connection so that they can't reach the destination server, and
login with their cookie yourself. I have only tried this with the BOS
server; it will probably work just as well with the ad servers, chat &
chatnav servers, and the directory servers. I assume they all run
basically the same server software, with software modules that plug-in
to provide the various services.

The server also does traffic Filtering, if a host has not received a
cookie, it will not let you access any service. The traffic filter
however, seems to have nothing to do with the cookie, if you have a
legitimate reason to access the server, it will let you.

FLAP
----

FLAP Is the low level protocol used by AIM, it uses TCP, and maybe UDP
but I haven't seen this yet. The FLAP header looks like this: struct
FLAP {    u_char   id;        /* a literal '*' */
          u_char   channel;   /* communications channel */
          u_short  sequence;  /* sequence number */
          u_short  length;    /* length of the data portition of the
                                 datagram */  };

The string "id" is an asterisk character, probably used to quickly
identify the protocol being used. The string "channel" is a numeric
value that allows you to multiplex FLAP. Just think of it like a TCP
port number. The string "sequence" is just that, a sequence number, all
FLAP datagrams must arrive in sequence, as there is no resend or
handshake functions. The string "length" is the length of the data
portion of the datagram - the datagram not including its 6 byte header.

>From What I've found, the 4 channels used in FLAP are:

  1 - Signon, Used to sign onto a server.
  2 - SNAC Data, Used to send data back and forth between the client
      and server.
  3 - Error, FLAP-related errors.
  4 - Signoff, Used to sign off a server.

DoS Attacks
-----------

On the More 31337 h4x0R side, AIM is vulnerable to a DoS attack using
HTML, the problem is:

AOL's Instant message's uses HTML. This enables their customers to
change font sizes, colors, backgrounds, to suite there tastes. Well
here is where the bug comes into play.  All you simply have to do is
send someone who is using an AOL version, that uses the <font> tag, an
instant message of:

<font = 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
999999>

An AOL instant message has to be below a certain character size that
can fit in one message. This goes beyond the valid size, as well as
being an invalid parameter for the <font> variable, creating a buffer
overflow effect. It will cause your AOL software to freak out, and a
GPF will occur. If you're able to stick more 9's in there, then please
do. This HTML thing might also be used to create a javascript message
box, but I haven't tested this yet, and frankly, I cannot be arsed.

RM Connect is now the main networking software for UK schools and
colleges, here's how to hack it...

RM doesn't take use of NT's event logger but instead uses it's own
program. which is almost as good and can log...  log-ons including
terminals and times, some programs used (but ours only does MSword!)
and can see printer by printer stats, it doesn't however log bad logins
or show up anything out of the ordinary since it pulls data from the NT
logs instead of showing it all.

RM user manager is where most things are set up, it's the alternative
to NT's user manager for domains and has everyone grouped into folders
such as 98intake, staff. If you ever get a look at this note the
"Homeless users" which is where most admin accounts hide. User manager
doesn't allow you to see which groups users are in (well not proper NT
groups any way) and so adding a backdoor to the Domain Admins will
probably go unnoticed. There is a link to NT user manager but it
doesn't have pretty pictures so most admins hate it :-)

RM FileProtector is another RM only app. You can tell if it's running
by changing the file attributes to almost anything in the windows
directory, if it's on you get a lovely blue screen warning you
something's up, but since Windoze is full of blue screens of death
anyway, no one notices!. There are a few files that it excludes so play
around and see if you can't find them! 

To disable FileProtector modify:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ResearchMachines/NOATTRIB.VXD

and make the new value of LoadVxd '0'. You can now rename files and
save to the Hard Disk of the computer. 

RM have QuickView installed as default so using MSword etc. open *.*
files and right click on your favourite exe, choose quickview and
choose the top left button to run the prog. There is a CD dump of the
windows CD (I think that's what it is) which is normally on:

\\server1\win95

and is used when progs want the CD, not had a chance to play with this
yet!

Machines can be "built" with a "Build Disk" which formats the HDDs and
reinstalls all the software, so if you see one of these lying around
they may B useful. You'll need the setup password for these disks, the
default can be seen above.

Pulling the "bit of network string" out of the back of them and then
changing the domain to log onto should result in a fully functional
desktop.

Most machines boot as A,C so dump a boot disk in and play with DOS.

A point that Yoda brought forward was that logging into admin areas
often brings up the dodgy wallpaper so be very careful when doing this
and use Desktop Manager to sort out this prob... You'll need to have
the password to DeskMan area though.

By bringing back the shutdown command (using poledit/regedit/grpconv)
you can restart without the files being overwritten if you hold shift
while choosing "restart windows".

The directory c:\backups is where the back-ups of the system are kept
that RM uses to overwrite at startup, but if you modify these then your
changes will stay. This can be easily done by...

cd\backup
attrib *.* -r -s -h
del *.da0
cd\hds
makebak

This makes your new changes to custom settings stick by using the built
in batch files in c:\hds.

If you find yourself in an unrestricted area you can setup shared
drives for windows, because user-level shares are setup you'll get a
full list of users from the server, these can make an interesting read.
If you do share the drives be sure to put a $ after the share-name to
"hide" it.

If you want to leave a picture/logo/message on the RM connect login
screen then overwrite the bitmap file in the c:\program files\rm folder
which will modify the picture of the 5 computers at the top of the
login screen. The bitmap there as default id blank and when opened in
notepad says "Dummy Logo" so if you want the computers back you'll need
to recreate the original file.

Having a look on the 404 page I came accross another way to break into
not only RM networks but any using Dr Soloman's Antivirus. The virus
checker is "un-killable" so even logging off will not kill the progarm,
if you log into any area then click the icon in the start bar this will
bring up the program. Now log off and the program will stay active and
hide behind the login screen, ALt+TAB to bring the program into focus
and then choose Help -> Contents to bring up the help file. From here
you can go File -> Open which brings up a common dialog box, and we all
know what fun they can be. Explorer your way into c:\windows and then
right click explorer.exe (you'll need to look for all files not just
help files) from the right click menu choose open which will bring you
up an unrestricted desktop, bewarned that any wallpaper changes etc.
are made to the desktop that is displayed behind the login screen
normally.

As far as I know you can tell if accounts exist with-out even logging
into the machine. To do this enter a login name and password and try to
login, if you see a pointer and hourglass combined cursor then the
account exists, if you see an hour glass quickly folowed by the error
message then chances are the account doesn't even exist! You may need
to try this on slower machines but that shouldn't be too much of a
problem in schools :-)

The propagate area is a much talked about feature of RM connect which
was previously thought useless. Propagator is a set of programs, the
application wizard scans systems before and after software
installations and then allows you to allocate the "packages" to other
machines. It does have it's own area though which at first looks seems
secure, there are two ways around it though, firstly you can use the
AntiVirus trick (brought to light by CFiSH, Toxic Fox and Drew I think,
see above) or you can modify the area in a cunning way. Since propagate
isn't supposed to be used it doesn't have a start menu (well nothing on
the one it has anyway), instead it uses the one in:

 c:\windows\start menu\

which can be modified from any area and then by logging into propagate
the new contents will be displayed, dumping a new folder in the
"startup" works well!

A bug in RM networks allows you to get an unrestricted shell fairly
easily, if you log into your area and then change the password, then
log into another machine ASAP I'm told you get all the run of an
unrestricted shell!

My chums at 404 have discovered another bug which applies to all
computers including RM ones. Called the "Green Screen Bug" it involves
hitting CONTROL+ALT+DEL while the machine boots to display hidden 
programs which can then be destroyed, for more info check out the 404
site at http://the404.hypermart.net !

I'm told that while propagating if you hit Control+Alt+Delete it will
drop you into an unrestricted shell, but I have my doubts about this
since I've not had the opportunity to try it, the source I got it from
has a lower IQ than cheese and Propagate runs as the Propagate User
which is highly restricted. The other problem with this hole is that it
only happens when your machine is being propagated, i.e. new software
is being put on it, so it only applies to rich/new networks.

Another tasty morsel from the 404 dudes is that if you dump stuff in
the:

c:\windows\spool\printers

directory it will stay there even after a reboot, I guess this is where
the files go that sometimes pop-up after a crash informing you that you
can print un-printed documents.

For additional holes read my Windows9X Security Holes doc available
from: 

http://www.infowar.co.uk/hacknet

If you know of other holes I'd love to know so I improve this text
file.

Here are accounts of how areas were gained...

I got "propagate" by disking Snadboy's Revelation
(http://www.snadboy.com) and adding it to the "Run Services" Registry
Key. Then, after running grpconv.exe, a Shift-Reboot ran it at the
prompt which pops up with this account and the star'd password (When
there's no cable attached).

BitStream

By scanning the network for open shares I discovered that one of the
machines' HDDs in the offices was shared, by editing win.ini I added a
keylogger and grabbed the admin password.

Just wait until you have a lesson in the computer room and all or most
of the computers are being used or off and say "Oh, dear mrs/sir I've
forgotten my password and need to do some real important work, can you
change it please?" The teacher (if its a computer teacher they'll have
admin access) will then see that all computers are taken or off and
then your computer will be the quickest to use ( no powering up) and
they will then log on to change the password. Before that of course you
disable the virus protection (if it is a recent version) and install
BO turn keylogger on close BO and loggoff - trust me it still records
keystrokes if you point it to your machine and turn it off. Once that's
done you have a file in the C:\ with the teachers password!!! Yipe -
don't open in that lesson, you could get caught.

<*> AlphaVersion's Guide To Anonymous Hacking 
<*> A comprehensive guide to wingating and hiding your idenity

Howdyz!

First of all let me tell you that English isn't my native language, so
if you find a few spelling errors learn to live with it.

Ok, so you want to keep the FBI/Secret Service/police/mom and dad/ISP
/little brother/dog off your back, something that sounds harder than it
is (except for the mom and dad/little brother/dog, which, if you
haven't noticed yet, won't be in this guide anyway). This file is
mainly going to concentrate on WinGates and proxies and shit. I know
it's basic but this is a newbie text after all.

If you plan on doing some hacking never use daddy's account, if
something goes wrong his ISP will cut off his account, making him
very pissed off, he'll probably never let you near his (or your own)
computer ever again. Better use a stolen account. I've read texts 
that suggested setting up an ISP account under a false name and paying
for it in cash, these texts are kinda old but I doubt ISP's accepted
cash in '93 and i'm sure they don't do it now. Dialing into your stolen
account from your own phone line isn't the safest thing to do either,
but sometimes you don't have a choice.

Your best bet is bouncing off a few WinGates too, along with a stolen
account. First some background info on WinGates...

WinGate is a program for Windows used to let several computers on a
LAN (Local Area Network, but if you didn't know that, stop reading)
connect to the internet with only one modem, the computer that has
WinGate installed will act as a gateway. But WinGate wouldn't be that
interesting for us if it wouldn't have some strange flaws and
defaults. The most important one is, as a default it opens port 23
(standard telnet port) and lets others connect to it. If you connect to
a WinGate you can use it to connect to another computer, the other
computer's logs will show the IP address of the WinGate, not yours. But
there's another interesting one, as a default WinGate doesn't log any
connections it gets.

Of course you don't have to go with the defaults but it is a Windows
application, most people install it with the default Windows way. Next,
finish and just go with the defaults, leaving everything open. WinGates
aren't that hard to find, there are several programs around the
internet that scan for them. But that takes up a lot of time,
especially when you don't know where to look. You may know about cable
modems and their high bandwidth, a lot of people want to share this
bandwidth, they're the ones that use WinGate a lot. If you find an ISP
that offers cable modem accounts you can scan their IP range. You can
also do it by hand, but that's not a viable option, that's like walking
to the the other side of the country when you have a train ticket.

A lot of people that use WinGates like to chat on IRC, a lot of IRC
servers have this thing against WinGate and g-line them (a g-line is
when a certain IP address gets banned from an IRC server). /stats g
will show all the IP's that are g-lined, when it says "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
insecure WinGate rejected" you found yourself a WinGate. Before you use
it for a hack you'd better see if it works (note that when you try 
it out it may work, but people sometimes turn their computers off or
close their connection with the internet, don't ask me why, also some 
ISP's give out dynamic IP addresses, which change everytime someone
logs into their account there). Telnet to that IP address, when you
are greeted by the infamous "WinGate>" prompt you've found what you're
looking for. But one isn't enough, you'll need more if you want to
stay out of shit. Was there only one insecure WinGate in the list? Try
some of the "Automatically banned for excessive connections". They
could be WinGates too.

Keep in mind that some WinGates do log any connections so it's best to
use more then one, I always use 5 to 10 myself. But sometimes all 10 of
them log, but as long as you don't do any damage they won't track you
through 10 WinGates, it'll cost too much. They'll just close whatever
hole you used, change all passwords and go on with life.

To bounce from one WinGate to another just type the other computer's
hostname or IP address (whether it's another WinGate or the target).
WinGates can also be used to remain anonymous on IRC (remember that
the WinGates you found by giving the  "/stats g" command won't work on
the server you found them). Connect to the WinGate's port 23 from your
IRC client (/server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 23) then connect to your favourite
IRC server by typing /raw diemen.nl.eu.undernet.org (or whatever server
you want). It will want a nickname, type /raw nick <nick> Give your
username and your IRC name by typing /raw user AlphaVers 0 0
:AlphaVersion (replace AlphaVers and AlphaVersion with whatever name
you want to use). On some clients you may need to use /quote instead of
/raw.

Have you ever noticed how e-mails send along your IP address in the
header? If you telnet to a WinGate and bounce a little you can change
that. From a WinGate type mail.whatever.com 25 (replace
mail.whatever.com with a genuine server running SMTP protocol of
course, 25 is the standard port for the SMTP daemon). For more info on
forging mail and sending it through telnet please read The Mob Boss's
article, "The Wonderful and Evil World Of E-mail" at
http://mobboss.dragx.cx/mail.txt

Hey, hey, HEYYY!!!

okay well I hevent mailed ya in fucken YEEERS but, hey, I'm a lazy
bollox, what can I do about it!! :)

well, cybie boy, i must give you credit. From reading you upzine, I
wasnt too sure that you were making a right decision, and I even
doubted your ability to produce a completely technically correct
article. But the articles have been getting better, and I can see that
you really do research some of stuff you've written. Your upzine
certainly seems to be on the up & up, and I've been even considering
helping out a bit with it, maybe an issue or 2 down the road :)

Ok well I'm working now for the summer. upgrading a personnel package
from 16 bit to 32. Tis pretty hard work, and thats what I like about
it. I could give you funny stories about the business, but they're

Yes, I think that mail sums up the philosophy carried by Up staff. Our
original motto "We're on the Up and Up" was not chosen by total
coincidence, when we compiled our first two issues we knew that we
were capable of so much more. This was complicated by real life stuff.
In fact getting out this issue was a big struggle, notice how people
all over over the world, particularly in America and the United Kingdom
have been doing exams recently? Any help GPF#2 has to offer would be
gladly appreciated. In fact, any help anybody has to offer whether they
already know staff members or not is so very welcome.
