INTRODUCTION:

C=The *use* of our credit system for personal gain & financial freedom!
H=The practice of accessing *secure* computer systems with innovative techniques
I=Assuming or establishing *new* identities for privacy and/or personal freedom.
P=The art of telco. manipulation for control and knowledge of it's systems.


    Some Personal Guidelines:

      These are my own personal guidelines concerning any of the subject matter
   within these texts. I never insist they are the *right* guidelines or the
   *rules* of the trade, because in this trade there really are no rules & regs.
   but your own.... and only they will decide your destiny.

  1). Greed is your worst enemy. Greed of material gain, mental gain and greed
      in self-realization. Basically if you take more, learn more or *think*
      yourself as deserving more - than anyone else, you will lose even what
      you have gained until not even freedom is yours'.

  2). In dealing with people/companies/authority, place yourself in their posi-
      tion and ask, "would I be hurt in any way by *my* actions. IE: If you
      assume an identity of another person for whatever reason, than do only
      what you would allow someone to do with your name, because one way or
      another *someone* WILL! Take nothing away from someone that you, yourself
      would not mind losing, because you will. Try not to see *things* as being
      yours' & never see others' property as yours', it never really will be!

  3). Lastly, when you must deal with the questions of right or wrong & should
      or shouldn't *I*, don't always decide with the mind, which is better left
      to instinct and our survival here on earth, whereas the soul & the heart
      have much deeper & longlived interests in such decisions... and therefore
      are far more dependable and truthful.

*C* - CARDING>                  /|\


Intro:
    Well, this being the first text file that I have ever written, I'm going
to begin it with a subject that I am the most familiar with of these four.

   "Carding" seems to be a fairly common practice nowadays. 3 years and a few
close calls later, I think I can safely say that I now know a few tricks of the
trade that could provide anyone with a bit more knowledge and insight into what
is a somewhat complex system.... I have decided to start out this text with a
"bang" so to speak, instead of starting out with the usual- "How To...Trash,
Get Carbons, and Buy Stuff... without getting caught", BS! ....Think small, and
that is what you'll get. Think BIGGER, but not TOO BIG... and it'll be cool.

     Now this segment of *C.H.I.P* is Carding, and there is so much info I
could include here that I figured the best item to write on would be the newest
item, at least to me anyways. I have seen a few files here and there on CC algo-
rithms, and found most of them to be fairly accurate, but kinda hard to grasp
for any prolonged amount of time (very short attn. span, I guess). So with the
aid of a cc verifier program, called "Vericard", written by: Daniel J. Karnes,
I think I have come up with a totally accurate, as well as VERY easy system to
figuring out *your* next "gig" or cc number.
 
 Will work with
 these Formats:   xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxXX;  xxxx-xxx-xxx-xXX;  xxxx-xxxxxx-xxxXX.

Intro:
   The following file is a list of "Computer Live" nos. found in the 818 NPA.
These phone nos., at time of this file's development were ph. nos. which ans.
with a carrier (modem). The date of this file's origin is Aug. 19, 1991 & the
final date of completion is: Nov. 07, 1991. This file is intended to provide an
up-to-date record of phone nos. that answer with a carrier, and therefore are
connected in some way with a host computer/network?....

   Your mission, should you decide to accept it (why not?.... most of the "work"
is done), is to call these nos. and find out what the heck is on the other end.
It seems that a lot belong to Tymnet, Telenet, as well as businesses, and some
independent store chains. Of course, even a few BBS' are included as well.

   If there are any that are of major interest, or if any findings are made
worth noting, then please add this info to the END of the file. This not only
will help you in future referencing, but will also help any other users who use
this file to gain even more insight to what's out there. Such organiza-tions as
the FBI, CIA & many law enforcement type entities can and do use a computer in
their day to day "activities", and these nos. (if any) should be noted below.
That will keep us all a bit safer, when exploring the unknown...

I - IDENTITIES


Intro:
    This chart is of California SSN's and their corresponding year of issue.
This is not only important in ascertaining the age of a SSN holder, but can be
used to assure accuracy in "making up" one's own SSN. This list is taken from
the very same pubs. that are used by our DMV and SSN offices and therefore is
very accurate (less any mistakes made in the transcription). It is fairly easy
to use, and I have found it to be useful in many situations as well.

  1). To figure out someone's age by their ssn (CA SSN only on this list), just
match the two middle numbers (IE.-xxx-XX-xxxx) with the chart below. The top
line of the chart lists the year of issue for each ssn series. After you have
figured out the year of issue for their ssn, then just subtract '16' from the
year of issue and you will have a good 'estimate' of their birth year.

   Example: 552-50-xxxx was issued in 1954, therefore they were probably born
in 1938.  Let's say that you want to know the birth date for xxx-57-xxxx, which
is not on the chart- Most SSN's after 1978  were issued in segments of four/yr.
xxx-53-xxxx for 1978; and- xxx-57-xxxx for 1979; xxx-61-xxxx for 1980, and so
on through xxx-97-xxxx in 1989.*^<-[+4 for each yr.]->^* -In 1990 of course
came the 1st of the 6xx-xx-xxxx series to be issued, although I am not yet sure
how the new series is being issued-... YET! anyways.

Here's the chart:

*P* - PHREAKING>


Intro:
   Well, since I am not all that knowledgable in the area of phreaking and
since I think every area of the subject has been covered by various other groups
quite well in the past, this will be the shortest of the articles in this text.
About the only two things I have of interest are items that I have not yet seen
in any other text files on other boards. Though they may be out there somewhere
1). is determining the phone number which you are calling from, and 2). covers
the CN/A number for ALL California NPA's, as well as Nevada's NPA (702).

  1> To find out the phone number of a phone you are using in the Pacific Bell
(Pacbell) service area, you just push <1223>. If you are in the GTE service
area- push <1114> or <1141>. What should happen then is a voice recording of
that telephone's number where you are calling from. It is extremely useful in
locating a particular line at say an apartment bldg. or other place where there
are ALOT of tel. lines to sort through, or when you are at a number that you
want to know, but for various reasons don't or *shouldn't* know it.

  2> Customer's Name and Address/Locality Office - CN/A Number. This office is
set-up for determining a telco. customers name and address, when only the phone
number is known. This office serves the 209, 213, 310, 408, 415, 510, 619, 702-
(NV), 707, 714, 805, 818 and 916 areacodes (NPA's). For the name and address of
ANY customer in these NPA's, you need only their telephone number. You then call
415/781-5271 M-F, 7am to 5pm and give the cna operator their number. If you are
out of state your acct. code is 2826, if you are within CA., then your account
code is 1659. They will probably ask you for this code so have it handy when
you call them. Again, this service will supply the cna for listed AND unlisted
nos as well...

.....see I said that would be short!  Well Sorta!...

   Anywayz, use this, abuse this, but don't lose this... and please include the
ENTIRE file when uploading to other systems or sharing this text file with other
users'/friends, because what may be one man's junk is.... well, you know..?!

The "Preceding" was brought to you by the writer of The "Following"..... and
therefore it should start to making some sense momentarily. Have fun, -JC>.
