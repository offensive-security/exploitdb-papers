Compact Disc Scam                                                         by Tequila Willy                      >>> a cDc publication.......1991 <<<                        -cDc- CULT OF THE DEAD COW -cDc- ______________________________________________________________________________     With a wonderful title like that, how can I go wrong?     This little scam will not reap heaps of completely free CDs, but it willallow you to increase your CD collection substantially.     Currently there are a couple (maybe even a few) large Compact Disc clubsthat specialize in mail order.  These clubs advertise in many magazines andoften boast things like, "DISCS, DISCS, DISCS, DISCS!  PICK ANY 8 CDs FOR APENNY Plus a chance to get one more CD-Free!  ANY 8 CDs FOR ONE CENT OR TAKEANY 4 CDs FOR ONE CENT!"  (Columbia House, 1400 N. Fruitridge Ave., P.O. Box1129, Terre Haute, IN 47811-1129)     The fine print informs you in a FRIENDLY manner that you must buy six moreselections at regular prices in the coming THREE YEARS.  After you do that, youcan CANCEL ANY TIME without any further OBLIGATION.     So, here's what you do.     Pick out your 8 CDs (for JUST ONE CENT!) and wait.  Then when you get yourlittle catalog immediately buy your six CDs and fulfill your obligation (thisway they get used to your BIG ORDERS.)  After they arrive, order 6 more CDs(oh, what the hell, make it 8 more.)  After they arrive wait a few days andcontact them complaining that you still haven't received your selections.  Theythen proceed to send you the same ones again.  You now have two sets of thesame CDs, send one of the sets back and say you "CHANGED YOUR MIND" (this isAmerica, you can do that.)  Since you don't pay for anything until you receiveit, you pay NOTHING (except for those six that you PROMISED to BUY).     You now have (COUNT 'EM) 8 + 6 + 8 = 22 CDs for the price of SIX (plus ONECENT).     Well, it's nothing to spit at.     What you do from here is up to you (like it always was-HEY, I DON'TPRETEND TO RUN YOUR LIFE!)  But, in case you aren't too bright (but that's notlikely) I'd like to share a little tip with you.  They MIGHT CATCH ON ifeverything they send you keeps "GETTING LOST" and you keep "CHANGING YOURMIND", so take it EASY and we can ALL ENJOY this little bit of FUN.     What do those things cost to make?  A DIME?  That MUCH?  Well, if I sawyour mug, I'd charge you FIFTEEN BUCKS too.  This is America, we can chargeeach other whatever we damn well please.     I'm proud to be a capitalist (but that's another t-file).  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |Copr. 1991 cDc communications by Tequila Willy         08/31/91-#192|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
