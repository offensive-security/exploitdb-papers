Ratte')           This article originally appeared in HIGH TIMES, May, 1989. ______________________________________________________________________________     In a hearing held last September, DEA chief administrative law judgeFrancis L. Young declared marijuana to be "one of the safest therapeuticallyactive substances known to man."  Citing reliable medical authorities, Youngstated that "There are simply no credible medical reports that suggest thatconsuming marijuana has caused a single death."  Young went on to say, "Bycontrast, aspirin, a commonly used medicine, causes hundreds of deaths eachyear."     Despite Judge Young's ruling that pot is safer than aspirin, thousands ofAmericans are persecuted, prosecuted, harassed and jailed each year because ofthe stigma attached to this relatively harmless drug.  The recent passing ofthe Omnibus Anti-Drug Bill marks the climax of the anti-drug hysteria that hasbeen building for the last eight years.  And with the ultra-conservative Bushadministration taking over, things don't look as if they'll be improvinganytime soon.                                 STATE BY STATE     Leaving the new Omnibus Anti-Drug Act and all other federal laws aside,individual states still have widely varying statutes regarding the possession,cultivation, and sale of marijuana.  What will get you one year in Tucson, mayonly get you a small fine in Toledo.  Some states, like Oregon, are verylenient when it comes to possession, but watch out if they nail you forgrowing.  Even one plant can get you a 20-year sentence and a $100,000 fine! The discrepancy between laws of different states is confusing, to say theleast.     Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, NewYork, Oklahoma and Oregon are states that distinguish, and give lesserpenalties for, persons caught with small amounts deemed for "personal use" inprivate.  The same amount used or displayed in public reaps a harsher penalty.North Dakota and Mississippi both have provisions in their laws for marijuanafound in vehicles, making possession violation much more serious; both stateschange a fine into possible jail time.  New Jersey has a two-year loss ofdriver's license provision attached to its already stiff possession penalty.     Quite a few states, Arizona and New Jersey among them, doubled thepenalties if the drug violation occurs within 1000 feet of a school even if youare busted for drugs in your own home!  It makes no difference if school is insession -- it could be 2 A.M., mid-July, or during recess -- minors don't evenhave to be anywhere near the bust.     On the other hand, it's very possible you might have to spend the rest ofyour life in jail if you're caught cultivating or selling large amounts of weedin Montana, Missouri, or Nevada.     Although it's not quite a life sentence, Arkansas, Connecticut, Oregon,Florida, Louisiana, Virginia, Rhode Island, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi andNorth Carolina slam the large scale grower/salesperson with a possible 30-yearincarceration.  North Carolina's law has a new mandatory minimum sentence of 35years for possession, sale, or cultivation of over 10,000 pounds.                                   FORFEITURE     Many states have forfeiture provisions written into their drug laws,making properties attached to the drug offenders liable to seizure by thestate.  On the federal level, the US Customs Service's "Zero Tolerance"crackdown, netted the service a fleet of luxury yachts in the last year.  Theever-zealous Coast Guard, which can seize boats found to be carrying even thesmallest amount of drugs, confiscated one unlucky man's yacht after finding afew seeds and two stems on board.  Possibly the most famous case of boatseizure came when the infamous "Monkey-Business" -- the "love boat" of would-bepresidential nominee Gary Hart and paramour Donna Rice -- was impounded afterthe Coast Guard found one joint on it.  Only after paying a hefty fine was thevessel returned to its owners.     Forfeiture provisions are not limited to boats.  The Federal governmentcan seize property involved in any kind of drug activity.  In Illinois, theJustice Department seized a suspected drug-dealer's gas station.  They laterreturned the property to his widow after discovering that the business camewith an outstanding $125,000 bill from the Illinois Environmental ProtectionAgency for emergency cleanup.  A Florida man, arrested by the US Border Patrolwith a small amount of marijuana and more than $400,000 cash in his car, woundup being with possession of less than one ounce of marijuana -- a charge whichwas later dismissed -- but ended up losing his bankroll.  Governmentprosecutors deemed that the money should be forfeited because the man wasallegedly on his way to purchase a large amount of marijuana -- a charge hedenies.     After stopping a car for a routine traffic violation, a Florida HighwayPatrol trooper confiscated $8,180 in cash when the driver could not give theofficer an "acceptable" explanation for carrying such a large wad.  The cost oflitigation involved in small forfeiture cases often discourages the victim ofwrongful seizure from fighting the case in court.     State governments usually have different forfeiture guidelines fordifferent amounts and types of drugs.  These guidelines include the forfeitureof drug containers, cars, money, and other valuables.  But in California andmany other states they can't seize your car if it's your family's sole means oftransportation.     Only 17 states currently have the same type of real estate forfeitureprovisions that are already written into Federal Law.  This figure is sure tochange for the worse in the next few years, so that not only can the USgovernment take your home, but the local sheriff's department can join in thebounty-hunt as well.                         CONSTITUTION? WHAT'S THAT?     Getting illegally-obtained evidence to stand up in court has always been aconstitutional nightmare for prosecutors.  Illegal searches (those carried outwithout a warrant or probable cause) are usually considered unconstitutionaland the evidence contained from them thrown out of court.  However, a recent USSupreme Court decision allowed prosecutors in Florida to introduce evidencegathered by police using a helicopter.  The whirly-bird flew 400 feet over agreenhouse that had marijuana plants growing in it, visible only from the sky.The police used the information gathered from the flight to obtain a warrant,but the Florida Supreme Court ruled it an unconstitutional search.  The USSupreme Court disagreed -- a fixed-wing aircraft can fly no lower than 500feet, but since there are no regulations regarding helicopters, this was notconsidered invasion of privacy.     In yet another case of civil rights erosion, a Florida State Court ofAppeals ruled that police can search passengers' luggage on public busses atrandom.  No reason necessary -- a funny haircut, suspicious walk, and yourprivacy is history.                          THOSE MADCAP POLITICIANS...     As if the current climate wasn't hostile enough towards pot smokingcitizens, there are always a few politicians ready to make things even moreoppressive.  For example, the Tennessee Sheriff's Association feels that anyoneconvicted of hawking drugs to a minor should be executed!  This would includefirst-offense sale of marijuana to a teenager.     A bill introduced in the Delaware State Senate would bring back publicwhippings as punishment for those convicted of drug offenses.  Delaware, thelast state to abandon the whipping post (in 1952), still had corporalpunishment on the books until the early '70s.  Democratic leader Senator ThomasB. Sharpe feels that the drug problem is serious enough to warrant restoringthis sadistic practice.  The ACLU, which vehemently disagrees, is currentlyinvestigating the constitutionality of the whipping post.     Representative Al Edwards of Texas has a novel, not to mention morbid,idea for dealing with drug dealers.  The bill he's sponsoring calls for dealersto lose the tip of a little finger the first time they're convicted.  With eachsubsequent conviction, they would lose a full finger.     While these penalties seem farfetched, these are the opinions of thepeople running this country!  Drugs are being used as a scapegoat for theproblems that America faces today -- homelessness, AIDS, unemployment, crime,and hunger.  The politicians feel it's easier and safer to attack drugs than itis to deal with deeper and more controversial issues.  And they don't care ifthey end up shredding the Constitution to do it.                STATE-BY-STATE COMPARISON OF THE MARIJUANA LAWS     compiled by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws                                    (NORML)ALABAMAPossession: 0-2.2 lbs.
