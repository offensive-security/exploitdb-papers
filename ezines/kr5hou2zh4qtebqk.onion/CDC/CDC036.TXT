It's the words of David Tarling, recording engineer, and talks of hisexperiences with Black Flag in their heydey as one of the best of the earlierhardcore bands in the U.S.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"We were all surfers.  We had skateboards.  Rollerskating, too, up and down the Strand.  It made sense to revolt eventually..."OK.  Here's where the Bop drops like big drum solos being played way out therebeyond the horizon, far past the waves pounding out the suburban rhythm ofHermosa Beach.  Y'see this is what a lot of the Black Flag thing means to me."Back in the mid-70's this dog gave up on the overly-glittered rock 'n' rollworld of Hollywood.  In Jermosa Beach I embarked upon my current engineeringactivities (please, let's not call it a career!)  when i discovered Media Art,a recording studio under construction.  So there I was fulfilling one of mybiggest dreams.  But on the other hand there I was recording some absolutelygodawful music played by people with absolutely no talent.  And then there wasthe wonderful Disco Era!  Yuk!  But that's the life of a studio staff engineer,uh, what the hell!So what about Black Flag?  Sometime in 1976 I began writing music reviews forthe local newspaper (Easy Reader) in an attempt to supplement my nonexistentincome.  This is when I first encountered Greg Ginn who was one of thestrangest people I had ever met in the South Bay.  Here was someone totally outof step with the sunshine and the surf and the skateboards, and although youdid have your outcast types who blended into the environment he even seemed outof step with them.  But leave it to my knack of communicating with thesestrange individuals.  Greg and I ended up in many discussions on music.One night we got into a particularly opinionated discussion about one of myreviews.  During the course of it he said how he wanted to start his own band.I thought: "What?  This geek in a band?"  So I asked:  "What kind of band?"  Heanswered:  "A punk band."  That was it!  I couldn't hold it back!  I laughed inhis face and said: "That's the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard!"  But thegeek didn't blink.  He just kinda twitched a little without seeming any lessdetermined.  Oh, what the hell?  That was my first real encounter with a musicthat I considered to be a lotta noisy bunk (Yeah, I admit it.  Back then I wasinto the progresso-sophisto music thing.)  Anyway,  Greg and I continued ourassociation and one day he loaned me the Ramones' first album which I thoughtwas great.  Not quite a religious musical experience, the Ramones at least hadan overload of grinding chainsaw noise and straightforward rock 'n' roll 4/4energy.  Y'know, the kinda stuff that was missing from modern music.  I lovedto play it for people.  I like to watch them cringe...Transition: 76-77 About this time Ginn formed his first band, a 4-piece unitwhich was minus one member.  Greg invited me to play bass with them and Iaccepted.  Sure, it's something to do.  The band rehearsed deep within thebowels of the Hermosa Bath House.  So one night I walked down to the Strand,banged on the door and went in.  Greg gave me this funky cheapo bass guitar andI plugged it in.  He picked up his guitar and started playing loud distortedatonal riffs and I cringed and wondered what I was doing in this dank decrepitdungeon with these strange cretins.  The band had a total of six songs, each ofwhich lasted no longer than one minute.  Greg showed me the simple repetitivechords--"Ok, do you want to try it?"Sure, why not.  "Ok, here we go, 1-2-3-4!! and BANG!! the drummer startedsmashing out a fast trashy straight 4 pattern and the wiry little singerstarted bellowing and jumping around wildly and Greg's body lurched forward ashe underwent a remarkable transformation from Jeckyl to Hyde.  His head shook,eyes flashed and teeth bared maniacally as he began to grind thick chords outof a guitar that in the shadowy light could have been mistaken for a chainsaw.Within seconds it was over.  Jeckyl calmly stepped out of his Hyde as ifstepping out of routine nightmare."You want to try it again?"  "Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, well uh, yeah...."  I wasdumbfounded, shocked, my eyes wide in amazement, my mouth hanging open indisbelief.  We played again.  1-2-3-4!!  Jeckyl became Hyde,  Music becamenoise.  Punk rock became a resident of Hermosa Beach.Ten minutes later we had played the entire six song set twice.Within a week Chuck Dukowski had joined the band as the permanent bass player.I continued on with my recording activities and eventually convinced the bandto record their first record at Media Art, which they did in early '78.  Beingstill an apprentice engineer my involvment in the Nervous Breakdown sessionswas limited to setting up microphones and later running some rough mixes forthe band."...using the record as a badge of legitimacy we were finally able to get ourfirst L.A. club gigs.  The first was a two night stand at the Bla Bla Cafe.The club hated us and our friends who had come to hear us.  They cancelled thesecond night and refused to pay us.  Our second was with another South Bayband.  The Last, at the Honk Kong Cafe in Chinatown.  We played anywhere andeverywhere we could and plastered the city with our posters and etc. with aliteral vengence.." -C.D.From '77 to '79 I was fanatically involved with radical rollerskating of the vertical kind and, except for studio work and photography, I did almost nothingelse.  Some of the sessions I did during this period were early Dangerhouse andPosh Boy projects, jazz sessions and, of course, the usual godawful disco shit.And it was when most of my rollerskating friends turned to learning (ugh!)disco steps that I said later with noise!"By its very nature Civilization dictates the need for undisciplinedacts."--"Beyond every horizon is an expanding Universe that grows out of tune,out of sink with itself. Harmony  No Harmony  Jazz  Uncontrolled Expansion  Theonly universal order is questionable.  It may not exist...it probably doesn'texist at all,"--"In a recording studio Jazz and Punk can be very similar.  Theperformances are often brilliant though lacking in polish."--"When in doubt godirectly to Punk,  Do not pass Jazz, do not collect $200 in Disco chips."-         -exerpts from the continuing SPOT journalSo there I was gone back to basics, back to music, back to a new insanity, andto Polliwog Park.  This was the gig that made me want to "produce Black Flag'salbum before they get killed.""...People threw everything from insults to watermelons, beer cans, ice, andsandwiches at us.  Parents emptied their ice chests so that their familiescould throw their lunches....Robo's shiny head made a great target...AfterwardsI enjoyed a lunch of delicatessen sandwiches which I found still in theirwrappers..."   -C.D.Yeah, a whole brand new insanity.  Shortly after the Polliwog gig I fell asleepin my house while the exterminators were spraying for bugs and nobody knew Iwas there.  True story.  I don't think I've ever recovered all the parts of mybrain since then, but so what!  I had the Black Flag album to work on so itreally didn't matter.The first session was nothing more than having the band tape a live rehearsalin the studio.  A few weeks later came the real thing.  One night while layingdown the basic tracks of "No Values" we had one of Greg's guitar cabinets outin the echoey hallway turned up full blast at 4:00in the morning with bothkitchen windows open onto the still night air.  That was enough to bring atleast one complaint.  So without further ado two night prowling cops invitedthemselves up by uninvited means.  Some could call it breaking-and-entering,others could call it whatever they want, but Greg insisted that he had closedthe door behind him when he last came in.  As the cops were exiting they asked:"What band is this?"  I should have said something other than Black Flagbecause they rejoined with "Ah, yes!  We've seen their graffiti on the Edison wall!"Once they were gone I immediately deadbolted the front door, closed the kitchenwindows and helped Greg put an attuator on the cabinet in the hallway. We thenwent on with another take of "No Values".  The next day while analyzing theprevious night's tracks I was certain I could detect the sound of footsteps inthe hallway and the moment when one of the cops opened the studio door.That's how "Jealous Again" started.  Immediately after recording all the basictracks Johnny Bob left the band."...He decided he never wanted to sing again.  He smashed his records andguitar and walked out disapperaing for a week.  He told me he had quit for good and had no intention of finishing the album..." -C.D.I had a real nervous breakdown.  Then Chavo was picked as a replacement but hewas nowhere near ready to record and the tapes sat on the shelf for months.  Weresumed recording when Chavo was ready but by that time he developed anannoying practice of walking out of the session in mid-take.  Verydisconcerting.  He quit completely in a dramatic walk-off during a gig at theFleetwood."...When he sang Jealous Again he had just gotten back from the hospital whereone of two girls fighting over him was recovering from a bottle broken over herhead.  It seemed to help him understand..."    -C.D."...No food, love, beer, and ego drove poor Chavo crazy..."   -C.D.-"I'd rather live in interesting exciting times than in placid dull times."   -Joe Nolte (The Last)The days of the Fleetwood were an incredible experience.  The epitomy of theHate-Kill-Destroy "Ethic" where the Huntngton Beach types reigned.  The H'Berswere all leather jackets, chains, macho, bloodlust, and bravado, and exhibitedblatantly stupid military behavior.  It was never a dull moment.  There was amass brawl every five minutes and as stage manager I had a chance to witnessthem all.  Sure, the fights were quite pointless but they were determined tohappen.  Face it, there were those destined to throw the punches and therewere those destined to be on the receiving end and a lot of us were destined towatch it all happen.  But forget about the simple answers.  It was a real lifesituation being played out with real life characters who dripped real lifeblood.  John Lennon was once quoted as saying something to the effect of:  Ifthere were no fights, It was not a good gig.When Chavo quit in the midst of BF's set he threw down the mike, jumpedoffstage, and for a while no one knew what to do.  Neither did the band.Imagine: hundreds of edgy, uncertain punks ready to use any excuse to createmass violence; the remaining members of BF sitting dumbfounded onstage:  I wasabout ready to grab the mike and tell everyone to "Go Home."  Greg told me:"no, we're going to play."  They resumed playing.  Some young kid jumpedonstage, grabbed the mike and started singing "Nervous Breakdown"  Allhell broke loose.  A couple of other kids jumped onstage and started fightingover the mike.  A guy named "Snikers" (ex-lead singer for the "Simpletones") jumped up and began singing "Louie Louie" and then proceeded to perform a mostdisgustingly drunken striptease during which cans, bottles, spit, sweat, andbodies began flying with a vengeance.  It was the finest rock & roll show I hadever seen.The ensuing Black Flag shows were just as inspiring.  Considering the fact thatthey had no vocalist, anything was bound to happen.  "Guest" vocalists took thestage and many of these people bragged up and down the west coast how they wereBlack Flag's " new singer."A few weeks after Chavo quit he and the band arrived at a mutual decision tocomplete the project.  Recording the vocals in a posthumous manner Chavo wassuprisingly cooperative and I was moved to remark:  "This is so easy now!  Whydidn't you quit the band before this?""...We also were thinking that a friend of ours would be a good addition to theband.  Dez joined as guitarist and we decided to try him on vocals if he couldpull it off..."  -C.D.Summer '80 and Dez became the new singer.  In later July BF was kicked out theChurch in a crazy melee that easily brought the police forces of three SouthBay Cities to the scene but not before the band had split said scene toeventually resurface in Torrance.So "Jealous Again" was still not completed and had taken on a reallysisyphus/Pride and the Passion-type felling.  I mean I had nothing better to dothan remix a song here, remix a song there "just for practice", and one night,about a week after he had joined VF,  I took Dez up into the studio as kind ofan experiment  "just to hear what it sounds like, y'know."  We put down a vocalon "Jealous Again," made a fast mix, and damned if I didn't try to talk Gregand Chuck into redoing all the vocals on all the songs with Dez.  Well theydidn't want to do that.  We recorded a few more of Dez's vocals but eventuallyreleased "JA" with the Chavo tracks.  Finally!  More than a year after theproject was begun!The above should therefore explain why there are so many different versions ofso many songs with all three singers.  Needless to say, remixing some of thesetracks two years later was like an audio treasure hunt.The latter half of '80  was also ripe with some of the wildest, craziest,"police participation" gigs.  Y'know, the Black Flag "Creepy Crawl" era thatprompted all the major and minor newsservices to jump onto the coverage of thegood ol' "PUNK ROCK VIOLENCE" issue. F'rinstance:  At the infamous Baces Hall gig in East Hollywood I was once againacting as stage manager.  Outside the hall was a state of near pandemonium withhundreds of punks milling about, dozens of cops wanting to shut the place down,photographers, reporters, and TV cameras waiting for the inevitable riot.Inside the hall existed a state of real pandemonium which I was trying to holdtogether.  At one point I was given the thankless job of announcing that "TheLAPD riot squad is outside and we have to shut it down!  Black Flag will not beable to play!"  To which I was showered with angry "Fuck You's!", beer cans andbottles with or without their contents, and hundreds of warm slimy globules ofspit.  I then thought: "Well maybe I can talk the cops out of stopping theshow." I pushed through the thick sweaty crowd and under the icy, quiveringlight of the circling helicopter I somehow managed to convince the officer incommand to let Black Flag play a short set.  Which they did.  The cops thencame inside and joined the party.Of course, not content with in-town destruction, Black Flag took their uniquebrand of Creepy Crawlism across the country in December of '80 on their firstU.S. tour.  By this time I had "volunteered" as BF's full-time live soundman.Whatta job, lemme tell ya!  Have you ever tried to mike a 100-megton blast?In the wonderful windy waste of Chicago was where we met our new hero, thelegendary Harold Schvenkel, former session musician who "aaah...worked with allthe greats!  Like yer Steely Dans, yer Eagles, yer Joi Mitchells, yer Queens,yer uh.. what the hell!  There's no integrity left in the business these dayand I need to... uh, let my nose heal, uh.... what the hell!"  Well Harry really dug the Black Flag thing and decided that the only way to kick a nastycocaine habit was to change his life, move out to California, and become aproducer.Arriving back in LA, we embarked upon our first 24+track recording session (allprevious recordings were 16-track) which became known as the "Aborted PoliceStory Project".  From this came the "Louie Louie"/"Damaged I" single.  This wasalso the final session done at Media Art which lost its lease and ceasedoperation in spring of '81, and where I had been living throughout all thismadness.  The vocal on the version of "Louie, Louie" contained herein was thevery last track I recorded at the studio.  The next day was when the controlboard and the machines were disconnected and carried out the door.In March came U.S. tour #2 which was a particularly fun one.  Back in LA wemade another attempt to record the album, this time in a new studio (GoldenAge) with Geza-X coproducing. From this was released the "Six Pack" single andtwo other songs "Machine" & "Police Story" for compilations.And that's about it, y'all.  Except for the commercials but there we have aclear-cut case of combined Black Flag/Merril/Spot overgelatination being fedtoo many pots of generic coffee during those crass midnight hours.  But likeour hero H. Schvenkel once told us:  "Aaaah....  What the hell!  Why get punched when you can get fully blasted?"                        -SPOT"I guess I was the first person to record Black Flag.  They looked real strangeand they had these big amplifiers.
