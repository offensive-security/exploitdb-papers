The Illusion of Motion                                                         by Tequila Willy                      >>> a cDc publication.......1991 <<<                        -cDc- CULT OF THE DEAD COW -cDc- ______________________________________________________________________________     There is only one being, continuous, material, and motionless.     Let's take a moment to examine a number line.<----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---->     5   10   15   20   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   70     It's pretty simple to understand.  The line represents a distance, and the"|" characters symbolize different points on the line-the exact points aredifferentiated by the number below them.     Any number line is understood to have contain points which aren'tnecessarily designated by a number.  For example, on the above number line weknow that between 5 and 10 we can find the point 7.  This example isillustrated below.     <----|-|--|---->          5 7 10     In fact, it is understood that there are an infinite number of points onany number line.  Between 5 and 7 we can find the points 5.009852, 5.9, 6,6.262623627000029873257690125762, 6.3336, 6.999, 6.9999, etc.     Rulers are examples of how we might commonly use a number line.  Differentrulers mark off different distances such as yards, feet, inches, centimeters,millimeters, and so on.  Obviously rulers cannot be used to measure alldistances because some distances may be too small to be measured practicallywith the naked eye.     Hypothetically speaking, let's say you had a worm and a razor blade.Let's also hypothesize that this particular worm is two inches long.  Now ifyou were to cut this worm exactly in half you should have "two worms" each oneinch long.     If you then took one of those one inch pieces and cut it in half you wouldthen have two pieces each one fourth of an inch long-I don't really know howmany times you can cut a worm in half before it stops becoming two worms andjust becomes pieces of worm.     Theoretically, if you had the right tools, you should be able to continuecutting that worm in half forever.  You simply take one of those 1/4 inchpieces, cut it, and then you have a 1/8 inch piece.  Then you cut it again, andyou have a 1/16..1/34..1/68..1/136..etc.  And why not?  If you placed this worm(prior to cutting it at all) on a number line and found it covered the distancebetween 1 and 2 (and we all know there are an infinite number of points on anumber line) then you should be able to use the worm as a kind of ruler and beable to locate an infinite number of points on it.     Okay, so now we know worms are an infinite number of points long.Skyscrapers are also an infinite number of points long.  Therefore, worms areas tall as skyscrapers.  Skyscrapers as tall as worms.     Because everything has an infinite number of points and is infinitelydivisible, then everything must be equal in length (width, height, etc.).     How is this possible?  Simple.  The universe isn't made up of manydifferent things, it's just one singular object.     Okay, let's consider another point.     You might think it's reasonable to believe that you walked across the roomand sat down in the chair in front of your computer, yet, as I will explainmomentarily, such a notion is ludicrous because motion is an illusion.     If motion is an illusion then clearly the universe is not made up of manydifferent objects (e.g. a chair, a battleship, a moon) but rather the universeis one large singular object.     When you see someone walk across a basketball court you tend to think youare observing motion.  But what are you really observing?  This person appearsto be traversing from point A to point B across the court.     A ----------------------------> B     Let's say that it takes this person 15 seconds to appear to move frompoint A to point B.  If this is the case, then the person is travelingthrough an infinite number of points in a finite amount of time because theline the person walks from point A to point B can be represented as a numberline (and we know that number lines contain an infinite number of points).     Because infinity implies no end, it's impossible for anything to travelthrough an infinite number of points in a finite (limited) amount of time.Therefore any apparent motion is actually an illusion.     The reason this person cannot move across the basketball court is becausethe assumption that many things exist also assumes that everything is divisibleand therefore the distance that any thing must move is divisible into aninfinite number of points.  And if, then, a person moving across a basketballcourt can never reach any point without first reaching its previous midpoint,and if there are an infinite number of points, it is impossible to traversethis infinite number of points in a finite amount of time.     Motion, then, is an illusion and there is only one being, continuous,material, and motionless.  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |Copr. 1991 cDc communications by Tequila Willy         08/31/91-#188|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
