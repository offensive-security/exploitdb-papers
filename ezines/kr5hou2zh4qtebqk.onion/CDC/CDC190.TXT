Hewoke up and fell out of the bed and on to the floor.  His eyes refused to focuswhen he finally opened them.  This had never happened before, so he began tofrantically rub his eyes, trying to somehow bring them into focus.  Eventuallythey focused themselves, and he calmed down.     Tim went into the bathroom and took a shower, and as the water sprayeddown on to him he looked at one of his arms and noticed a bunch of bumps onthem.  His mind was sent reeling at the notion of having some kind of adisease.  With an act of sheer will, he managed to concentrate on gettinghimself clean, steadfastly ignoring the bumps on his arm.     After he was fully dressed, Tim made himself some breakfast and sat downto read the paper while he ate.  On the cover of the paper was theheadline: "AIDS Cases In Green Bay On The Rise."  He went visibly pale at thethoughts that began to form inside his head.  It's very possible, he thought ashe continued to read.  After he finished reading the paper he went to work, histhoughts still on the AIDS epidemic.  After work he drove over to the freeclinic to have an AIDS test, just in case.  The nurse told him that it wouldtake about a month to process the blood, and they would have him come in whenthe results got back.     Over the course of the month the panic came more and more often, leavinghim physically and mentally exhausted.  To alleviate the tension, Tim began todrink to calm himself down.  After a week of drinking, his appearance began todecline, he forgot to shower and shave, and he was always late to work.     The third week after the test he was fired from his job, and he couldn'tface a day of work without being drunk anymore.  None of his friends knew whatto do, they were all concerned, but he wouldn't talk about it to anyone.  Hishouse was getting filthy by now, liquor bottles laying everywhere, andsomewhere in the house the smell of vomit was growing stronger.     Finally the day that test results were due in came along.  A lady fromthe clinic called him to come in to find out the results of the test.  Beforeleaving the house Tim drank a couple of shots of vodka, just to calm him downenough for the bad news.  He was driving across town on the interstate when hiscar swerved into the oncoming traffic, killing him and four others along withhim.     The doctor at the clinic got the news of the accident and sighed as hethrew the folder with the negative test results into the garbage can.  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |Copr. 1991 cDc communications by Obscure Images        08/31/91-#190|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
