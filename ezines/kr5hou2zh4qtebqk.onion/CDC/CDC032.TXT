-cDc-_______________________________________________________________________________--FIVE YEAR PLANI lose you winI lose you winI lose you winI lose againBut you're on my five year planYour time will comeWhen you least expect it, expect it!     The five year planYou fucked me overYou did me wrongYou know whyI wrote this song(CHORUS)Until then I'll just pretendThat you are still my friendBut in the end your time will comeWhen you least expect it, expect it(CHORUS)I don't forget so easilyNo, I'm not so quick to forget(CHORUS)I hold a grudgeI live for revenge(CHORUS)I win you loseI win--TEAR IT DOWNFighting this society there's onlyOne way to winWe must stick together throughAll thick and thinCross over the line ofYour stubborn closed mindDon't be surprised at whatYou might findThings you thought wrong may haveAlways been rightYou'll probably find faultIn your reasons to fightYou really don't differ fromWhat I can seeAin't it time to unite or is it just me?Just as we watch themBuild this empireSo they shall watch us tear it downIf not with our words then withThe power of our sound!Fighting this society there's onlyOne way to winWe must stick together throughAll thick and thinCross over the line ofYour stubborn closed mindDon't be surprised at whatYou might findWe are the future soLet's get things straightCombine our forcesBefore it's too lateFighting ourselvesCan't go on any longerWe must fight togetherIf we want to grow strongerWe can tear it downWe must tear it downWe will tear it down--COFFINA coffin is uglyA coffin is sadDestined to beOne's last padTo lay in as a corpseFor the rest of your lifeIn another coffin, of courseNext to you, is your wifeA coffin is lonelyA coffin is badThe shape of seclusionA coffin is sad--PROBATIONThey set the rulesThey want me to breakTake all my moneySet me straightThen they confine meMake me check inAnalyze my pissAsk me where I have beenThey send me to classesThey say I've been badTake some more moneyProve to me I've been hadAnd they'll keep on tryingTo straighten me outAnd the more that they tryThe more I doubtThis system of corrections That they put me throughHasn't brought about changeBut this is nothing new--I.D.K.Y.Look into my eyesTell me what you seeAmplified starlightPure energyYou cringe from my powerGo home and take a showerI am intelligent lifeYou are lessLook into my heartTell me what you feelPain and agonyFrom a horrid ordealYou flee from my sadnessFinding no gladnessI can handle it o.k.You really can'tLook into my mindTell me what you thinkOf the mange and madnessOf a missing linkYou stiffen and turn sourDescending from my towerYou fall and turn awayYou are mine!--DECISIONSYou ask me questions I can't answerGive me problems I can't solveOther suggestions I can't respectIs there anything at all?You give me reasons for your ideasAll the facts behind your thoughtsTell me of your observationsAnd count the number of my faultsI hide a smile, I wear a frownAlways wanting to play the clownI make my plan, I lose a chanceAs I perform a long death danceLife or death, it's all straight upMake my choice and throw it upShot glass full, down the hatchMy mind's made upNo second chance--HOOKEDYou're tied downYou're locked upYou've got no way outYou're broke downYou're fed upYour lungs start to shoutYou're wincingConvulsingYou're aching with painGasping for breathAnd you're feeling insaneHole after hole just proving your pointPoint after point just digging your holeSlow digging with a spoonHOOKEDYou're hooked on a drugThat's controlling your mindHocking your soulFor that measly last dimeYou're dragged offAnd thrown in yourOwn padded cellYou've reached end of ropeAt bottom of wellYellow-black arm holeOf eager junk acceptanceThin steel prick cums in your armI see you fall over and over againHanging on to nothing you thoughtWas a friend--GO DIE!You're bothering meFor anything freeWhy can't you see?I'm out on a limbMy nerves are stretched thinYou really don't win     GO DIE!You seriously askFor my autographI can't help but laughJust leave me aloneWhy can't you go homeA brain you don't own     GO DIE!Following me aroundJust like a lost houndAnd you're bringing me downI tell you goodbyeAnd you ask me why     GO DIE!Guess I'm just shy--RED LINEWay past overdriveFull on redlineNo easing upYour life's flying byPushing and passingYourself you've just passedFirst over the finishYou still come in lastFace turned to stoneYour eyes owl wideNo easing upMore speed is your highLook and feelTwice your ageGrinding in your silent rageDying atTwice the speedYet not enojugh toQuench your need--NO RELIGIONWon't see me on my kneesTake my soul and save it pleaseTen Hail Marys for my sinPaying heaven to get inGot no money for your basketA million times you can ask itFind your Bible far too oddAin't got time for your God     I've made my decision     Don't want your religion     No more church bound prison     Or Jerry Falwell televisionDon't forget he's coming backSo put your dollars in the stackThe second coming's getting closeSo pay up now and get the mostForm a line for all to payAnd do the same next SundayStep right up and clean your soulSingle file, young and old(CHORUS)Wash your brain, a strange obsessionYou're an angel post confessionHoly book tells right from wrongLast donation, overdrawn--FUN N' GAMESStep on mine, I'll step on yoursTake what's mine, I'll take what's yoursBleed on me, I'll spit on you     Inconsideration     Part of the game     Voted rules     Are always changed     Plans are made     But rearranged     And only one thing     Stays the sameYell at me, I'll yell at youPush on me, I'll push on youFuck with me and I'll screw youI turn it up, you'll turn it downI speed up, you'll slow downAnd you'll reject what I accept(CHORUS)You stay healthy, I'll be sickYou dominate but you've been trickedThink it's over, it's just begunTo you a nightmare, to me it's fun!--OBLIVIONThe day has comeThe time is nearFor all to endIt's true, it's hereIt's all over nowNo way to stopThe button's been pushedThe bomb's been dropped     The city is melting     The sky burns red     The ocean is boiling     We'll soon be deadDeath has come knockingThe door's open wideHe's let himself inNo place to hideA tidal wave of powerComing over the hillA great wall of thunderSwooping down for the killLeveling, destroyingEverything in its pathJust seconds left nowTill we feel its wrath(CHORUS)People run rabidFrom the great blastThe Beast is upon usIt's here at lastThe streets echo screamsFilled with fearAll through the universeBut no one will hear-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hey hey...my eyes are dead and the file's done.  ...this is
