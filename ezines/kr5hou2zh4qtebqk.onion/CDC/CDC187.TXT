The rap records which were being made in the beginning, like theones on the Sugar Hill label, were disco records with a guy rappin' on top of'em.  That's because these were companies who, before rap became popular, weremaking disco records.  What I tried to do was make records that had more to dowith what the rap scene was about in the clubs, where the kinds of beats theywere rapping over weren't disco beats; they were Billy Squier and Aerosmith -rock and roll beats!  So I thought what needed to happen was to make the beatson these records more oriented toward rock."     ADLER: "Rappers make rock and roll.  My notion of rock and roll isn'tpegged to a big, noisy guitar.  I think rock and roll has always been aboutattitude and rhythm; it's about aggression, rebellion, sex, and a big beat.It's also about intelligence and wit.  And if those are the qualities that youlook for in rock and roll, you're gonna come to rap."     RUBIN: "A Run-D.M.C. concert, which, two or three years ago, would drawmaybe a 70 or 80 percent black audience, is now drawing a 70 or 80 percentwhite audience.  I'd say that's a crossover.  Things are definitely changingin rap."     McDANIELS: "When we did 'Rock Box' and 'King Of Rock,' these headbangerscouldn't believe the tracks we made.  They like, 'Yo, man, that's really bad!' It definitely brought them in, and now, they still with it.  Even if Run-D.M.C.don't put a metal track, they gonna buy the album and they'll wind up liking ahip-hop jam, they'll end up liking a cut like 'Run's House' or 'Beats To TheRhyme.'  Now they understand it.  They followed the guitar in there, and thenthey found out there was a whole other side to it."     ADLER: "Can I tell you why this music wins?  Because it is intrinsicallypowerful.  This is some of the most exciting popular music being made by anyoneanywhere on the planet.  I've always said, 'Please let us play on a bill withBruce Springsteen or whoever most white people think is an exciting rock androller.  We'll go on first!'  Let me put Public Enemy on before BruceSpringsteen; that would be it for brother Brucie; he'd be finished!  He'd haveto go and take an early shower!  Public Enemy would get off the stage and thecrowd would head for the exits!"     SILVERMAN: "Is rap rock and roll?  Rap is what rock and roll should be.When rock went to sleep, rap rose from its ashes." _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/     The chapter on rap in the late '80s will have to be written whenhistorical distance affords a little objectivity.  It's safe to make severalpredictions, though, based on the words and music of some of the moreinnovative rappers.  For example, it seems clear that we'll be seeing a returnto the use of live musicians in the studio and onstage.     SILVERMAN: "Stetsasonic is the first rap group to tour with a livedrummer.  It's sort of a retro movement, because all the sampling that'sdone is James Brown stuff, which was live drums to begin with.  Stetsasonichave three emcees, two deejays, a guy named D.B.C. ['Dynamic Beat Creator']who plays synthesizers, a live drummer, and a guy who makes scratch soundsand beats with his mouth.  It's sort of like a hip-hop orchestra."     McDANIELS: "People are startin' to put basslines in it, and pianos andhorns.  A lot of the records you hear on the radio now got good tracks behind'em.  The music is maturing, progressing, and as it does, the rap scene does. The rappers and the deejays go into the studio and put a beat down and rap overit and then they say, 'Hey, I know a bass line that would go great with that!' So I would say the scene is getting more musical.  Or at least, people areutilizing more musical sounds.  Musicians play an important role; they add theflavor to the beats.  We always have a lot of real instruments on our tracks. But people are still sampling.  We're still dropping in beats from James Brownor Billy Squier or the Meters."     The tug of war over the ethical and legal aspects of sampling willcontinue as rappers go on painting remarkable pastiches in sound.     GEHR: "So far, the big case involves the Beastie Boys, and the groupthey ripped off for their tune 'Brass Monkey,' off of LICENSE TO ILL.I suspect that will be settled out of court, because everyone's afraid ofsetting a legal precedent for this stuff.  If record companies were smarter,they'd say, 'Sure, anybody can do it,' because people from their recordcompanies are going to want to rip off people from other companies.  Butthey're so concerned with keeping their turf that that's probably not goingto happen.  There will probably be these dippy little court cases that getsettled out of court without setting any legal precedent.  I don't think it'sgoing to be etched in stone."     ROBINSON: "We've never really used bits and pieces of other peoples' stufftoo much, because a lot of groups are getting involved in lawsuits over that. We just take ordinary sounds, like if I hear a noisy car outside, I'll grab thelittle sampler and sample that.  Or if I hear people talking, I'll sample thattoo.  Or if I'm watchin' TV and I hear somethin' from a commercial, like wherethey say, 'Parkay... Butter!,' I'll sample that."     DADDY-O, from Stetsasonic: "Our latest single and video, 'Talkin' AllThat Jazz,' is pro-sampling.  It's almost like an anti-James Brown nowadaysrecord, now that's he's coming back with this static about sampling.  I'mjust establishing what we intend to do with sampling.  We sometimes use thewords 'recontextualization' or 'revivification,' but it means the samething, which is to take something old and make it new again.  The strongpoint of what sampling does for us, as a music form, is to establish somesoul groove and some old funk that's lost with today's R&B in the name ofcrossover, in the name of pop charts, in the name of Whitney Houston,whatever.  You know what I'm saying?"     STEVE ETT, engineer and co-owner, Chung King House Of Metal studios:"I'm with everybody who steals stuff to make new stuff, because in my book,one plus one equals three.  If you take one thing and add it to somethingelse, you get two in mathematics.  But in the real world, when you take onesound and add it to a second sound, you create a third sound.  By stealing abass line from one old record and sticking it into a drumbeat, you create awhole new song."     McDANIELS: "If you use somebody's material, just give 'em their royaltiesand everybody will be happy and merry.  That's something you should do rightaway instead of waitin' until your records sell, because if your record doesgood, the person will be like, 'Yo, I want mine.'  Then you can't put the albumout 'cause you be goin' to court and then you sittin' there mad, you know?"     Rap is travelling beyond its old neighborhoods, and adapting to diverseclimates throughout the world.  In the U.S. strong growth pockets in LosAngeles and Miami are creating new sub-styles of rap.     SILVERMAN: "There's a Miami sound called 'bass music,' with modulatingbass and a heavy 808 sound.  And there's a California sound, which is totallydifferent, typified by artists such as Ice-T, people who are selling a quarterof a million or more records in L.A. and don't ever get played in New York. All of the California stuff and a lot of the Miami music is high-speed rap of120 beats per minute or more.  It all sounds like 'Planet Rock.'     BAMBAATAA: "It's spreadin' from country to country.  You have Jovanotti,this white Italian guy who had a Number One rap album in Italy.  You haverappers in Holland.  You have a couple of groups comin' out of Belgium andGermany.  A lot of the European rappin' is mixed, where you have blacks andwhites doin' it together.  I'd say France, besides England, has the funkiestacts.  France is the only place that had a syndicated TV show called HIP HOPthat was on for two to three years."     SILVERMAN: "A British school of rap is beginning to rear its head.Derek B., Cookie Crew, and a whole new level of rappers are starting toemerge from there, with very strong Jamaican roots.  If anything, they're alot more knowledgeable about reggae, which sells a lot more in that countryper capita than it does here.  So I think that they're going to have a legup on us when they do get into rap."     RUBIN: "I think the British scene might be the future of rap.  Muchlike Led Zeppelin taking the American blues and doing a white boy bastardizedversion if it, the British might do the same thing with rap.  I don'tnecessarily like what they've done to it, but I think that's the onlychance it has."     GEHR: "The interesting thing about the British rap phenomenon is that whatmost hipsters seem to be into in England isn't rap at all; it's hip-hop.They're not into rap as an American derivative of Jamaican toasting, so much asthey're into the idea of hip-hop being a larcenous kind of music that borrowsfrom a lot of other sources, reorganizing them in interesting ways.  They'reinto rap more as radical music than as social commentary."     McDANIELS: "I like them English guys.  They seem to be with it.  They'rejust as enthusiastic as the people over here in the States; I think they wantit more, even, 'cause they're not from here, you know what I'm sayin'?  A lotof rappers do good over there, get a lot of radio play, do successful tours. It's very, very easy to get on TV over there, they got so many music shows. The scene over there is very good for this music, and I like the rappers thatare comin' outta there.  I think, right now, they just wanna see who's the bestrapper, who got the best beats and stuff like that.  But eventually, you'llhave some of 'em comin' out, discussin' what's goin' on in the streets, givin'a message, making a strong social statement." _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/     Rap, it seems, is everywhere.  But despite its escalating sales, anddespite the push given it by respected critics in THE NEW YORK TIMES, THEVILLAGE VOICE, and other publications, it continues to receive little or noairplay on white or black radio.     ADLER: "There's a kind of paradox build into our success.  At the sametime that we've achieved enormous critical and commercial recognition, we'vealso had to face an awful lot of resistance in the form of bans on radio.If Public Enemy got airplay commensurate with their true popularity, they'dsell ten times as many records as they're already selling.  They've alreadysold 750,000 records in six weeks without any airplay!  Everybody in the musicindustry understands that radio is the chief sales medium and yet we findourselves banned.  Why is this happening?  Because rock radio doesn't play rap. There's a more or less blanket ban on music by artists of color.  They don'tthink that black musicians play rock and roll.  That's why we think AOR means'Apartheid-Oriented Radio.'     "The thing to understand is the difference in the cultural climate todayvis a' vis the '60s.  Take Woodstock, for example: There was an even balance ofwhite and black artists there.  Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone were the heroes ofthat event in a lot of ways, but there was Crosby, Still, Nash & Young forpeople who liked folk rock, Joan Baez was on the bill, The Who were there, andthey were all mixed up together.  And that wasn't unusual because that's theway radio was at that time.  When Sly Stone had a hit and The Beatles had ahit, you heard them back-to-back on the radio.  What happened, in the early'70s, was that the once-monolithic rock audience was demographed by radioprogrammers.  Now, there's so-called 'rock radio' for white kids in the suburbsand so-called 'urban radio' for black kids in the cities and there's verylittle actual crossover in terms of day-to-day programming.  So rock radioplays virtually no black artists, even though there are musicological linksbetween the staple music of AOR and our music.  An artful programmer couldprogram Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, and Eric B., along with Van Halen and therest of those bands.  Why aren't they doing it?  It's racism!  They're afraidof black people!  It's all-white staffs and all-white deejays playing all-whiteartists for an all-white audience.     "Now, black radio is fucked up on the basis, not of racism, but of class. To put it in current cultural terms, it's a war between the buppies and theB-boys; buppies are black yuppies and the B-boys are our guys.  Black radio isrun by upwardly mobile black men who, even if they come from a background likeChuck's, don't want anybody to know about it.  Rap music pulls them right backto the streetcorner, which is distasteful to them, even terrorizing.  It'sblack, aggressive, loud, sexual music, and it has very little to do with LutherVandross, who's a staple of black radio at this point."     Rap, according to Adler and others, has also been virtually ignored bythe technically oriented music press.  The problem, it seems, is thathip-hoppers simply don't fit the white, middle-class definition of a musician. A musician, according to that definition, is someone who toils over manuscriptpaper in an age where the studio has become the standard notational tool.  Amusician is someone who values manual dexterity above all else, in an age wherecomputers may soon circumvent that aspect of music-making altogether.  Amusician-the subtext reads-is a lanky-limbed Briton with a mid-'70s shaghaircut playing florid, high-register arpeggios that are equal parts Liszt andLiberace.  What a musician is not, and could never be, is a black kid from theBronx making whukka-whukka sounds with a record needle.     SILVERMAN: "To me, hip-hop deejays are musicians.  The technique that'snecessary to be one is at a level of sophistication similar to what it wouldtake to play an instrument.  It's really difficult to do what they do, playingthree seconds of a beat, in rhythm, and locking it so that it loops and theycan play it back and forth without missing a beat.  They're taking platters,throwing them on, cueing them up, and going back and forth between twoturntables so that it sounds like it was recorded that way.  Making new musicfrom seven or eight other records is an incredibly difficult thing to do.  I'veheard people cut as little as one beat back and forth, from one turntable tothe other, left, right, left, right, without headphones or anything!"     "Current hip-hop represents the use of synthesizers and drum machines bypeople who are musically illiterate but could be musical geniuses.  I believethat there could be Beethovens and Mozarts in the ghettoes of the United Stateswho never surface because they can't get access to the tools of music.  As theprices have come down on synthesizers and drum machines, they now have accessto instruments which they don't need manual dexterity to be able to play,because of sequencing.  They're able to put down musical ideas which they can'texpress on an instrument that takes some type of musical articulation."     "Without any airplay, rap sells more concert tickets and more recordsthan any of this.  Anything that can sell more than 30 million albums a yearwithout any airplay-more than Marillion or most of these groups that you readabout in technical music magazines-is a legitimate art form that people areappreciating.  Rap music is real.  Rap isn't a bunch of middle-class guys withmoney going out and putting on makeup and talking about throwing their parentsout the window [Twisted Sister].  It's about people who are living in ghettoesand have no way out.  And it's also a mega-business, practically an industryunto itself.  I mean, how long can you ignore it?"     D.B.C. ["Dynamic Beat Creator"], sampler/synthesist for Stetsasonic:"Who's to say what music is?  As we move further toward the future, music isgonna change even more drastically, and then what you gonna say?"  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |1991 cDc communications by Mark Dery                   08/31/91-#187|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
