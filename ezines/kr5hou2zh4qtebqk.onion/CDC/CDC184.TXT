It Looked Back at Me                                                         by Tequila Willy                      >>> a cDc publication.......1991 <<<                        -cDc- CULT OF THE DEAD COW -cDc- ______________________________________________________________________________     Purloined Sirloin sat across the table from Micrometer Eyeball. Micrometer Eyeball didn't have that standard pair of eyes which you can fingeron most human beings, instead she had one large eye set in the center of herforehead.     Because it stuck out so far, it looked as if that eye would fall out atany moment.  It twisted and turned in the light, the pupil dilated and lookedat him.  The muscles in her skull gripped that eye like a hand wears a glove.     It didn't have an eyelid and that bothered him.  He could sit here andtalk to her, but that eye never shut.  It never blinked, it just stared throughhim like cold steel moving through his hot belly.  A moist pink nerve wasvisible near the back of the eye.  It pulsated with a steady rhythm.     Twitching, moving, looking, always looking.  He tried to stare back, butthat eye was unmerciful.     Without warning, Purloined Sirloin jumped up and tackled MicrometerEyeball.  Pushing her to the ground he sat on her.  He had one thigh on eachside of her chest.  Though she struggled and screamed in surprise, that eyejust keep looking and watching.     It was as if that eye wasn't a part of her.     It was then that he leaned over and began to chew on that eye.  His teethpierced it like a hard boiled egg.  Micrometer Eyeball screamed in pain asblood began to dominate her face.     The eye had the texture of Jello in his mouth, but the lens was chewy likesquid.  The eye was easy to get at because it couldn't protect itself with aneyelid.     Purloined Sirloin stood suddenly and washed down his meal with the rest ofhis beer.     Belch.  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |Copr. 1991 cDc communications by Tequila Willy         08/31/91-#184|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
