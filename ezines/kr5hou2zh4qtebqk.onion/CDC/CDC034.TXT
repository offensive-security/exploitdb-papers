They'recrawling all over....The companies think it's time we all sit down, have aserious get-together--START ANOTHER WAR......The president? He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro....Napalm....People runningdown the road, skin on fire....The Soviets seem up for it....The Kremlin's beenitching for the real thing for years.  Hell, Afghanistan's no fun....So whadyasay?.....We don't even have to win this war, we just want to cut down on someof this excess population.....Now look.  Just start up a draft: draft as manyof those people as you can.  We'll call up every last youngster we can get ourhands on, hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use anautomatic rifle and send 'em on their way.....Libya???  El Salvador?  How 'boutnorthern Ireland?  Or a "moderately repressive regime"  in South America?....We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story in the Middle East--We need thatoil.... We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Kjadafy's hit squad didn'teven show up, I tell ya....That man is UNRELIABLE.  The Kremlin had theirfingers on the button just like we did for that one...Now just think for aminute--We can make this war so big--so big....The more people we kill in thiswar, the more the economy will prosper...We can get rid of practicallyeverybody on your dole queues if we plan this right.  Take every loafer onwelfare right off our computer rolls....Now don't worry about thosedemonstrations--just PUMP UP YOUR DRUG SUPPLY.  So many people have hookedthemselves on heroin and amphetamines since we took over, it's just likeVietnam.  We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong, keptthe war functioning just fine.  It's easy, we've got our college kids sointerested in beer they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombsagain.  Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, they would't even know whatit looked like.....So how 'bout it?  Look--WAR IS MONEY.  The armsmanufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full productionthe whole economy is going to collapse....The Soviets are in the same boat.  Weall agree the time has come for the BIG ONE, so whadya say?!?....That'sexcellent.  We knew you'd agree....The companies will be very pleased.                                  -THE PREY-You're from out of townI can tell that by your shoesFlew in for the conventionGetting tipsy in a barYou're leavin' pretty lateGotta get up in the morningThinking she's just too expensiveAnd you know you're...Probably....Right!There's no one on the streetsAnd you can't find your hotelYou walk a little faster--Someone's following youThe wallet-size bulgeIn your double-knit buttHas money for meAnd maybe credit cardsYou dart around the next cornerYou can't look aroundQuick now, fish for the keysFor the doorYou don't even know where you areYou walk a little fasterI walk a little fasterSensing that I sense youNow there's no escape I can almost taste your dandruffAs I reach for your face--And I strike                           -BUZZBOMB FROM PASADENA(Words: Biafra; Music:  Ray & Biafra)Buzzbomb Buzzbomb macho-mobileThe road's my slave, that's how I feelI cruise alone, I cruise real farShoo young punk!
