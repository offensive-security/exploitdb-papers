With itsre-release, cDc comm. is quite orgasmic to announce The Raver's unceasingfulfillment as a child of the Cow.                             -SR_______________________________________________________________________________In the Beginning...     The house was as silent as the moon was bright that dark, perilous nightback in December.  The living room was dark...the stairs, equally so.Surveying the upstairs hall we see that all is dark, save a narrow bar of lightescaping under one of the white doors.  The faint sound of tapping could beheard...     Behind this particular door was the bedroom of a teenage boy.  The room'soccupant, one Harry Poindexter, was present.  He sat in his "self-styled"throne tapping away incessantly at his keyboard.  Let us look and see whathe is doing... click click click..."Damn!"...click click click...     Harry, an accomplished hacker, called himself the Avocado Bandit, inmemory of his greatest hero.  He was using his Apple IIe to attempt to breakinto a local system that he had just recently discovered.  Here is what hismonitor echoed to him...CONNECTPurgatory Systems, Inc. UNIX System V;login: _     What utter melancholy thoughts draped this young boy's mind.  He had beentrying to gain access for the last six hours.  Thoughts of getting a super-user account and the powers he could wield brought him to the brink of orgasm."I must succeed," thought Harry, "I will succeed ... for I am the AvocadoBandit!"  As the last of his default logins failed, he sat back and thought ofevents that occurred earlier in the day...     When he had skipped school so he could log on to all the boards and leavemessages about his newest victories, when he called his poor mother a worthlessdog, when he sullenly apologized a half hour later and went to the grocerystore with her so he could get some "Mr. T Cereal", and when he set up aconference with some of his "k-phriends" so that they could exchange codes andinfo.     He told AE to autodial the number again and resumed his task with arenewed vigor.  This time when the login prompt appeared, he felt a cold chilland a single word materialized in his cranial passages ... Lucifer.  Here iswhat happened when he logged on again...CONNECTPurgatory Systems, Inc. UNIX System V;login: luciferpassword: _     Getting worried, he hung up and thought.  Small beads of sweat appeared onhis white fulfillment.  Although he had posted logins on boards all over thecountry he had never actually hacked one out.  Nay.  He simply "leeched" thelogins from other systems and re-posted them saying that he had hacked it.Now he was worried.  He had gotten through the first door.  Now how to getpast the second?  "Lucifer," muttered Harry, "What word is akin to that?""Satan?  Belial?  Beelzebub?"  He dialed the number yet again...CONNECTPurgatory Systems, Inc.

With that, Harry tried theever-useful who command...$ who am ilucifer  tty08  Feb 13  02:06     For the next hour Harry played with the unusual UNIX system.  By 3:30 AMhe had created himself a super-user account.  He hung up and dialed in again totest out his new account...CONNECTPurgatory Systems, Inc. UNIX System V;login: sammypassword: toyzLast login: Sat Feb 13 3:24$ _     "Man," exclaimed Harry, "That's so K!"  He hung up and went downstairs tothe kitchen.  His rummaging around in the refrigerator woke his mother up.  Shecame downstairs in her bathrobe and went to the kitchen... "What are you doing,young man," she exclaimed.  "You know it's way past your bedtime."     "But mom," whined Harry, "I'm just getting some Kudos and a glass of milk."  Harry poured his milk into his Superman glass and listened intently tohis mother.     "Son, it's 3:30 in the morning.  Why don't you eat your snack, wash andbrush, and go to bed.  Please, son," pleaded his mother.      "Okay, mom," said Harry, the resentment in his voice plain as day.  Withthat his mother went back upstairs.     A few minutes later Harry went back up to his room (which he calledPirate's Zone) and sat down on his bed to munch upon his Kudos and milk.  Afterhe was done eating, he set the dishes down in the corner and lifted up themattress of his bed and retrieved a ragged, dog-eared issue of Penthouse.  Hesat in his bed and tossed off for a while.  When he was done he just looked atthe pictures for a while and wished that he could kiss a girl... He then fellinto a deep sleep, his light and computer still on.The Next Day Is Not Always Brighter...    On Sunday, Harry awoke with a start.  He had had raving nightmares allnight.  In one particularly horrifying episode he had dreamed that he was tiedand bound to a post on a ledge far above a vast cavern.  Filling the cavernwere hundreds upon hundreds of demons.  In front of him was a large iron anvilandhis limp cock was tied to it with a thong of black leather. In front of hissweaty face dangled a microphone with a small ID badge on it. The badge read"HBC Radio 666". He looked around the cavern. The reddish glow horrified himthe most. He whimpered and was shocked to hear that such a small sound echoedthroughout the dankness of the cavern at such a high volume. His mortal mindattributed that to the microphone that swayed gently before him. His feargrew stronger when he heard the thumping of footsteps to his right. He lookedover his shoulder and saw a demon approaching him. The demon had the torso ofa man and the legs of a goat. It had a pentacle burned into its hairy chestand wore both a headsman's mask and a necklace of linked golden discs. Themasses cheered as this executioner approached poor Harry. Harry was confusedand bewildered, that is until he saw what the demon cum executioner carried,a large sledge hammer. Harry glanced down at his dongle and choked back ascream. The masses were going crazy as the executioner hefted the sledgehammerup high. Harry screamed as the sledgehammer connected with his cock. That waswhen Harry awoke with a start...His mother was calling to him, telling him to come downstairs to eat hisbreakfast. Harry got up and slinked over to his computer, clutching at hiscrotch all the way. On the screen was printed something that horrified him.Here is what Harry saw on his monitor...Did you enjoy your nap? We're waiting for you to come and visit us..._Harry stifled a gasp and flipped the ON/OFF switch at the back of his Apple.The monitor shimmered, flickered, and then went blank. Harry ran downstairsto eat his breakfast...When Harry had finished filling his stomach with eggs and pancakes we ambledback upstairs to get ready for church. He undressed and hopped into the shower.He liked to pretend that it was the transporter chamber on the U.S.S. Enter-prise^^ on StarTrek. As he turned on the water he heard a chilling voice...         "Ready to beam down...energizing..."As Harry shrieked the water turned a crimson hue and he passed out. When heawoke he was in fetters and chains and naked as could be. He tried to hidehis "manhood" as he stood before the great, iron-wrought throne of Satan,Lord of Hell. Satan smiled at him... all Harry could do was whimper. As Harrystood there, cringing before the might of Satan, he tried not to think of thedreams he had had the night before...Into the Lungs of Hell..."You are a pitiful sight, mortal. Had you not hacked your way onto one of myUNIX systems I might never have known of you," said Satan, "but the thingsthat you have done to my Purgatory are great indeed. Do you know what troubleyou have caused, boy?" A tear streamed down Harry's cheek, "But all I did wasto create a super-user account. Honest. I swear to God...ulp." Satan bellowedforth with an intensity that shook the very foundations of this text file...         rumble...rumble...rumble..."Enough!" screamed Satan. "I sentence you to never-ending aeons of punishmentand torture! You will forever wish to die! Just when it appears that yourmortal body can no longer take the punishment I shall give it you will behealed. Thus you will never die! In fact, I bequeath upon you that which manhas sought for all eternity... immortality!" And with a mere flick of Satan'staloned hand Harry instantaneously reappeared elsewhere in Hell...Harry was sweating profusely when he found out what kind of predicament he wasin. Lying on his back, the warm and rocky floors of Hell gave him little com-fort. He was still naked and he was in a spread-eagle position, hand and footbound to an iron stake firmly implanted in the barren floor. High in the dim,reddish skies of Hell circled several vultures, eaters of carrion. He couldhear the screams of anguish of his "neighbors". What was his fate?Less than a score of minutes later the punishment that Satan had ordered wasbrought down on him, never to cease. Four imps of Hell fluttered over on theirsmall, membraneous wings. They landed to his sides and snickered in their eviland high-pitched voices. One of them grinned and bit his leg. Harry screamed.The gaping wound in his left thigh seemed a well of crimson. But as Harry wasexperiencing the pain of such a wound it miraculously healed up. Harry, fulfillment'no longer in pain from the bite, was still screaming his lungs out... It wasthen that another of the imps assaulted him. This one raised his iron pitchfork up high in the air and brought it downwards, mercilessly grinding itsthree forked points into Harry's crotch. The screams filled the air, the goreand blood welled, all to no avail. For as soon as the damage was done thewound healed itself back up.The Light is Always Darkest at the End of the Tunnel...Thus was Harry's fate sealed for all eternity. But what of his poor mother,you ask? Quite simply answered, friend. When she heard Harry's shriek whilehe was in the shower she ran upwards to see what was wrong. When she got tothe shower where Harry had been she was greeted by an unpleasant sight. Thebody of Harry (or rather an imitation thereof, for the real Harry was inHell) lay over the drain. His body was covered in lacerations and blood wassplashed all over the place. And right in the middle of his forehead stuckout the handle of a knife, the blade buried deep within his cranium. Mrs.Poindexter screamed only once before she died of massive heart palpitations.Thus ends our wonderful excursion into the Lower Infernal Regions. Join menext time when we experience more demonic slaughter...=============================================================================== (c)1988  cDc communications  by The Raver                           2/25/88-47 All Rights Worth Shit                                                                         
