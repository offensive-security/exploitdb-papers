When I left the bar I made her walk several feetbehind me, like Chinese women used to do.  I told her it was because I didn'twant anybody to see me with a woman, but really it was just her-with hercrewcut what would people think?  This was long before punk had made theandrogynous look respectable.  Even inside my building I made her walk a flightbehind me up the stairs.  I was poor then, and lived in a walk-up on theBowery.  And yet I was not unhappy, for I lived entirely for love.  Much of thecity did then, though it never will again.        I put on a record, took out two beers, turned down the lights, and satnext to her on the couch.  I felt relaxed, as I always do with someone lessattractive than me, since then it's up to them to initiate sex.  I would neverhave walked over to anybody who looked like her at the bar.  And yet as Istared at her pale, soft skin, her short, spiky hair, my pants got wet:amazing.  A wave of total peace washed over me and I shut my eyes.  The ballgame was not in my park.  Whatever happened, happened.  I didn't choose it andit was not my fault.        She began to tell me about her life.  She had grown up in some smallupstate town, the kind of dreary town one might look back at with pleasure butwould yearn to escape from at the time.  But even in retrospect there was nopleasure for her, because her father had caught her humping her girlfriend on asleepover date when she was sixteen, and beat her up.  A year later he caughtthem again and threw her out of the house.  The girlfriend left her to marrysome guy, so she moved to New York, where there were other people like her.  Itwas during one of the lulls in the East Village, and she quickly found a sharein a four-room walk-up between First and A.  The normal thing for someone likeher would have been to become a waitress, but she wasn't attractive enough(though in a few years her short-cropped hair and male suit jackets would beall the rage), so she took this job her roommate found her in a T-shirtfactory.  They were lovers, though Diane was fat, unattractive, a real cunt. All day long they hammered stuff on T-shirts-shiny little round things thatmade patterns.  It was lower-class, blue-collar, real boring, back in thosedays before the Sony Walkman.  That is, it was boring to Laura to live it, butnot for me to listen to it.  Everyone I knew was a struggling writer, painter,or some other arty type, so hearing her was refreshing, the way it would havebeen to spend a day in an African village-or Passaic, New Jersey.        She was supposed to be at work by eight in the morning, but she was anight person and often was late.  She'd pick up a coffee and bagel and bring itinto the factory.  Nobody cared, everybody was in their own world.  She hadgotten to be friends with some of them, but Diane was jealous of anything thatmoved.  Lately they hadn't been getting on so well; that was why she was withme now, though if Diane found out she would kill her.  If Diane had walked intoBonnie and Clyde's and seen us talking, she would have beaten Laura up-andmaybe me too.  But luckily she hung out at Gianni's, where the seriousbulldykes went-the ones who were into cross-dressing.  At least that's whatthey used to call it, before the style seeped into the upper classes and gotrenamed the "androgynous" look.  Most of the time Diane was on the wagon, butwhen she got drunk she went absolutely crazy.  She would push Laura up againstthe wall, and throw words like "slut," "bitch," "cocksucking cunt" at her. Then she would slap her.  Laura was thin, pale, soft with tiny birdlike bones,and I could see the pleasure one could get in terrorizing her.  Once Dianepunched Laura in the face and Laura had a black eye and didn't go to work foralmost a week.  She made up some story but everyone knew all about it anyway;they always did.  Laura would tell Diane that Diane didn't love her, that Dianejust wanted to control somebody.  But when Laura threatened to move out, Dianewould threaten to commit suicide, and Laura would end up staying.        "Why did you sleep with her in the first place if she's so horrible?" I asked lazily.  But I knew the answer: it was similar to the reason why I waswith her tonight, though somebody tall and blonde and beautiful was probablylying sleepless now because of me.        "Oh, she's not so bad," said Laura.        The record was over, I thought about getting up and turning it over,but I didn't, then the silence became interesting.  I was spacey from themarijuana, and I realized how tired I was of being even a little bit in charge.Of anything.  It began to seem more disruptive of the mood to put on music thanlet the silence be-though bits of songs played in my head like a movie track. I realized how rarely it was I was with another person without some kind ofmusic in the background.  I wondered if Laura was playing something in her headtoo.  I cleared my throat to speak, but I stopped.  The silence grew more andmore awkward, but then this very awkwardness should compel her to do something.        As I waited I began imagining Laura and Diane together in a bed: a fatbulldyke and a water-pale wisp.  The relationship was mysterious,incomprehensible, but what relationship wasn't?  The tall blond woman whowaited for me-my official-who was she and what did it mean when she said sheloved me?  What could it possibly mean when i told her I loved her?  Whatrelationship did the person I thought I was have with the one sitting here onthe couch, my pants wet at the idea of having sex with someone I kept tellingmyself disgusted me.  Was it that I secretly liked her, and was embarrassed bymy attraction, or was it the disgust itself I liked?  Did Laura put up with thefear and beatings because she liked Diane, or was it the fear and beatings thatshe liked?        "What are you thinking?"  she asked.        "Oh, nothing."  I waited awhile "Actually, I was thinking about Diane. Whether she'll punch you out when you go home."        "Does it turn you on to think about that?"        "Maybe."        Her hand slipped inside my blouse and touched my nipples.  They wereerect.  Her hands were cold.  I heard myself breathing fast, and the uttershamelessness of this-the person I was breathing fast for-only made me breatheeven faster.  Had I ever been more turned on?  And yet, she was scarcely doinganything-barely circling the tips of my nipple with her finger.  Why couldn'tshe put her mouth there?  My body strained toward her as in a bad porno movie. She shoved her hand inside my closed jeans, though because of the tightness ofmy jeans she couldn't get very far, maybe a little south of my belly button.  Itwisted to meet her fingers, to move my pubic hairs a little more toward her. I yearned for her to undo my belt, unsnap the snap, push down the zipper, slideher pale white fingers inside my underpants, spread my legs, drive me crazywith her icy touch.  But no, she continued this lazy circling of her finger. Gradually the yearning turned to anger, that she was dawdling, torturing me bythis slow tease.  And yet, oddly, the angrier I got, the more my respect forher grew.        Finally she put her mouth on my nipple, undid my belt, unzipped myjeans, and shoved her hand inside my pants.  Even then, she didn't slide herfingers straight in, but kept tweaking my pubic hairs, somehow managing toavoid both my clitoris and vagina.  The bottom of my body bucked in a way thatwas at least partly nonvolitional.  Her arm pressed down on my pubic bone and Ifelt like I couldn't move (though of course I could).        "God, you're wet," she said.        At last she pushed her fingers inside my vagina and crawled on top ofme, so that the weight of her body was on the arm that was inside me.  Whereasbefore she had been gentle, now she became incredibly rough, jerking her armback and forth very quickly.  I was so wet it didn't hurt.  "I bet I could getmy whole hand inside," she said, as if in a question.        "Okay," I whispered.  At that moment there was nothing I wouldn't havelet her do (though of course there was).        She cupped her fingers, trying to get her hand inside.  It was as if Ihadn't felt her before, as if my skin had been numb to individual sensations,that I'd been this wet tunnel down which something smooth had been shoved.  Butnow I could differentiate her various fingers.  "Three," then "four," shecounted out loud.  She had to struggle to get the last one in, and so did I. "Am I hurting you?"  she asked.        "That's okay."        "If I'm hurting you I'll stop."  She started to withdraw her hand.  Mybody sucked out after it.        "It feels good," I had to whisper.        "Oh."  Was I imagining the triumph in her voice?  In any case, shespread me wide, as if she were about to give me a D&C, then I felt herknuckles.  She was trying to bend her hand into a fist.        This really hurt, in a way that was hard to tell whether it waspleasurable or not.  The tips of my nipples were no longer erect, and thewetness seemed, not a response to some unfulfilled yearning, but a reflex nomore interesting than the turning on of a faucet.  And yet I was pushing mylegs apart as far as possible so she could get her fist inside my vagina. Peaceful, I guess you'd best describe it, almost as if I could fall asleep.  Imoaned when she put her teeth around my nipple.  "You're very sweet," she toldme.        I have always felt this to be true, though very few people haverecognized it as such.  With my nipple still in her mouth she pushed my jeansdown so they encircled my ankles.  I as sweating and messy.  She was muchcooler than I, almost clinical as she proceeded, which not only aroused me butmade me like her better.  Somehow things were more in balance than earlier inthe evening.  I wished she had brought a camera with her so we could have takenpictures of me masturbating to the sight of her naked body-and ever after Icould torture myself as to what she had done with them.        Abruptly she pulled out her hand, then I heard her stand up.  I kept myeyes shut, wondering what she was doing, if she were going to search up somestrange toy in her pocketbook.  I heard her walk away, then behind my lids Isaw, or perhaps felt, the warmer glow which I pretended was sun, but which wasreally a distant light in my apartment.  I heard the toilet flush, but not thesound of the sink.        She came back.  Her hands made me shiver.  I opened my eyes.  "Did youwash your hands?" I asked.        "What do you think?"        They were cold, so I decided to assume she had.  I lay there, the jeansstill around my legs, in the same position I had been in before, as if I weretied up and couldn't move.  This passivity both embarrassed me and turned meon.  She took my right hand with her left and gently brought it up over myhead.  She held it down with her arm as she lowered her head onto my breastsand bit my right nipple.        "Ow," I moaned.  But I didn't push her away.  In fact, the lower partof my body gyrated toward her.  She took my other hand and placed it above myhead.  She held both my arms down with one of hers as she crawled on top of meuntil her knees held down my arms.  She pulled my belt through the loops on myjeans, and wrapped it around my hands.  Then she took the end and wrapped itaround my hands.  Then she took the end and wrapped it around the leg of mycouch.        Both the leather and buckle cut into my wrists.  The belt wasn't verylong and I had to lean partway off the couch.  "That hurt," I said.        "But you don't mind," She said.  Silence.  "Do you?"        "Not exactly."        "I didn't think so," She stared at me rather impersonally, then slappedme lightly on the face.        "Ow," I said.  But it didn't really hurt.        "Come on," she said.  She ran her fingers very lightly down my stomach,then all of a sudden slapped me again.        This time it did hurt, but I didn't say anything.  "How does thatfeel?"  she asked.        "Okay," I said        "'Okay?' Is that all?  We'll have to do something about that."  Sheslapped me again, even harder.        "Ow."  this time I wasn't so sure I liked it.  It was no longer part ofmy fantasy.  I wasn't sure what was coming next.  For the first time I reallypulled at my hands to see if I could get free.        "Roll over."  she said.        "What?"        "Roll over."  With the belt around my hands it was hard to do this.  Ihad to move even nearer the couch leg and kind of slip my head around under myarms.  Gently she ran the tips of her fingers over my ass.  It rose slightly inthe air, waiting for her.  Whether the goosebumps were from her touch or thecold, I didn't know.  I kept worrying I would fart.  She stroked down the crackto my vagina, where she soaked up some goop with her finger.  She used this tolubricate my asshole.        "One sec," she said.  She got up, went over to her jacket to getsomething, came back.  With my eyes shut I waited for her finger, or maybe evena tongue (this being long before the Plague), but I felt something hard andunfleshy-feeling press against me.  "You ever use this?"  she asked.        By turning my head as much as I could, I could see the black leatheraround her groin and the pink latex in the shape of a penis sticking out fromit.        "Not this way," I said. "Won't it hurt?"        "That's up to you."  She spread apart my cheeks and moved forward overmy ass, then began to press the dildo into me.        "That hurts," I said.        "Just relax."  She ran her fingers over my ass, and I felt thegoosebumps again.  I realized I was holding muscles tensed, and told myself tolet go.  As I exhaled she pushed it in further.        "Ow!"        "I told you.  Relax."  She moved a hand back inside my vagina, and inspite of the pain the wet began to flow, as if there were two separate bodiesinside my one head.  The other hand continued to help ease the tip of the dildofar enough into my body so that it wouldn't fall out.  When I had relaxedenough to open myself to the pain, she put the hand that had been holding thedildo inside my mouth.  The hand smelled like wet rubber, and I liked it.  Shemoved her fingers in and out of my mouth in a kind of lulling rhythm; I drooledon them as if it were a cock I was sucking.  Then she began to move her fingersalong my gums and the muscles under my tongue, even in my nose, then back intomy mouth.  It was strangely erotic, though I did begin to worry about germs. With all this distraction I did not have much mental space to concentrate onthe area of diffuse pain around my asshole where she was still pushing in thedildo.  When on occasion I thought of it I moaned, but the pain, althoughintense, was made bearable by the thought of my strange submission.        Not just bearable-pleasurable-at the thought that all my holes werefilled, my body possessed, not by just anyone, but by this being who disgustedme.  Had it been someone I cared about it might have been different, but sinceI did not know her, and there was nothing I could do about it, I might as wellrelax and enjoy it.  No doubt I would have been happy enough with her on adesert island, where I could let her make love to me all day and no one wouldever know.  And yet, with world enough and time, perhaps I would not havewanted to let her do it, or she herself might not have wanted to do it.  For isit not often true that when you want someone to make love to you all day, theydon't want to, so you have to make love to them in order to get them to want tomake love ot you-so the person who wants sex the least generally gets more ofit?        Then, beyond the pain and mental pleasures, came a powerful sensationof peace.  I realized all my life I'd wanted something in there.  The hand thathad pushed in the dildo now cupped my right breast, as if a boat had capsizedand she was hanging onto me.  I was tired and wanted to go to sleep.  The sweaton my body was drying up.  I hadn't had an orgasm, and I knew I wouldn't getone.  "I'm cold," I said.        She kissed the back of my neck, which made me shiver further.  Then shetook her hands off my breast and out of my vagina and began to push herself upoff my back.  The dildo pulled out a little, which hurt, though not as much aswhen she had put it in.  "Ow," I said.  But what I really felt was sadness.  Ihad gotten used to it being there.        "Shh."  She fiddled with something, then abruptly stood up.  Thepeaceful sensation was still inside my body, but less so.  When I turned myhead I saw that the dildo no longer was attached to the black leather belt. She untied the end of my belt of the couch leg and carried me perhaps fifteenfeet over to my bed.  "Be careful," I said.  She was so small and I was scaredshe'd drop me.        She placed me down on the bed, my ass still in the air with the dildosticking out of it.  The pants belt was still looped around my hands.  She tooka blanket and placed it over me.  It pressed down on the dildo a little, whichfelt good.        Then she crawled on top of me, turned my head to the side and kissedme.  Her lips were incredibly soft, and in spite of my fatigue I felt sexualstirrings again.  "What can I do for you?"  I asked.  In spite of my disgust, Iwanted to bury my head in her, in order to fall asleep.        "Nothing."        "You sure?"        She kissed me again, then stood up and began to walk away.  Again Ishut my eyes.  I wondered what other trick she was going to come back with:blindfold, handcuffs, tit clamps.        "Goodbye," she said.        "What?"  I opened my eyes.  Whether it was because I didn't want her togo, or because I didn't want that peaceful sensation that had spread from myasshole to the rest of my body to leave, I couldn't be sure.  I began toimagine my loneliness after she'd gone.  "I give the best head in the world," Isaid.  "Haven't you heard?"        "So that's who they were talking about at the bar."  She was so deadpanthat for a moment I got paranoid.  I never expected anyone I was with to havethe slightest sense of humor.        "I really do," I said.        "Some other time."        She moved toward me, and I waited for her to remove the dildo. Instead, she pushed it in further.        "Ow."        "That's in there pretty good now, isn't it?"  She patted it.        "Yes."        "I'm going to leave you like this."        "No. It hurts."  But the more it hurt, the more I liked it.  And her,standing calmly by in her jacket, indifferently pushing the pink latex into me.        "You don't really mind, do you?"  Silence. "Do you?"        "I guess not," I admitted.        "I knew you wouldn't."  She gave it a last shove, then bent down tokiss me briefly on the mouth.  Then she moved to the door.  I knew it could bedangerous to be left like this, my arms still tied by my belt, but I loved theidea of being able to tell my friends about it in retrospect.        "Will you come back and get it?"  I asked.        "Maybe.  You never know."  She opened the door, then left.  The words"I love you" played through my mind, but I knew it wasn't true.  But I felt assad as if they were true.  For a while I lay there, then I maneuvered the beltoff my hands, pulled out the dildo, and went into the bathroom to brush myteeth and wash my face.  Even when I was back in bed, listening to the countrymusic station play songs from a region I wished I had been able to escape from,rather than move toward, as I was doing now, the sadness stayed with me.  Itwas the same sadness that was always there, and it occurred to me I must likeit.  Why else did I keep going to bars, if not to find it?  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |1991 cDc communications by Jane Delynn                 08/31/91-#193|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
