Aquaman and Twinkies Cakes
"THAT DIRTY BEACH"

Special Thanks to The Zimmie

Box one:  The ocean is filled with dirt and sharks.  A lifeguard is turning
away swimmers.  A sign reads "BEACH CLOSED INDEFINITELY"

Grime of the century closes Beaches.  Shocking reports of undersea creatures
attacking swimmers.

Important Man:  "Aquaman, I know I can depend upon you to remove this stain
from our beaches.  Without your help our beaches are sunk!"

Aquaman:  "Something smells fishy!  I'll investigate--you can depend on me."

Businessman 1:  "Without the beaches, who'll buy suntan lotion?"

Businessman 2:  "No beaches, nobody buys bathing suits!"

Hot Dog Salesman:  "You better do something fast!!"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Box two:  The four look on as Aquaman enters the water.

Aquaman (to himself):  Holy Mackerel!  I'm entering troubled waters!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Box three:  Sharks circle Aquaman.  KABOOM!  One is attacking!

Aquaman (to himself):  These sharks aren't responding to my call--it looks like
I'll have to fight them tooth and fin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Box four:  Aquaman has taken out all the sharks and is after their leader,
Slud-Jak.

Slud-Jak:  "Aquaman!  You land lover!  Humans pollute our homes, and now I'm
getting even.  If you take a stand against me, it will be your own downfall."

Aquaman:  "Slud-Jak, you're fighting dirty!!  Besides, two wrongs don't make a
right!  Now try MY right on for size."

BOOM!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Box five:  Aquaman has won... but has he?

Aquaman:  "The answer is to negotiate to Slud-Jak.  But you'll need pretty good
bait to get him to the bargaining table."

Important Man:  "Delicious HOSTESS(R) TWINKIES(R) CAKES will be the thing to
clear up this mess."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Box six:  A bubble underwater.

Later--

Aquaman:  "Agreed!  Now we've got clean beaches and a new undersea treat!"

Slud-Jak:  "HOSTESS(R) TWINKIES(R) CAKES--delicious!  Whale of a taste!"

Important Man:  "Scrumptious HOSTESS(R) TWINKIES(R) CAKES... the best food on
the land and in the sea."

YOU GET A BIG DELIGHT IN EVERY BITE OF HOSTESS(R) TWINKIES(R) CAKES.
