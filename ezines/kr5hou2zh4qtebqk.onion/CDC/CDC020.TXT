You do not like them.
So you say.
Try them!  Try them!
And you may.
Try them and you may, I say.

Sam!
If you will let me be, I will try them.
You will see.

<at which point in our story, the heretofore tormented hero cautiously 
 takes a bite of the "green eggs and ham">

Say!
I like green eggs and ham!
I do!  I like them, Sam-I-am!
And I would eat them in a boat.
And I would eat them with a goat...
And I will eat them in the rain.
And in the dark.  And on a train.
And in a car.  And in a tree.
They are so good, so good, you see!
So I will eat them in a box.
And I will eat them with a fox.
And I will eat them in a house.
And I will eat them with a mouse.
And I will eat them here and there.
Say!  I will eat them ANYWHERE!

I do so like
green eggs and ham!
Thank you!
Thank you,
Sam-I-am!
