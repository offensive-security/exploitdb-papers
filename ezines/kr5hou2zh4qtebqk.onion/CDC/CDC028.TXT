When call forwarding is  activated by a customer, all calls to that line are automatically routed  to another line designated during activation. [C.F. is ESS's answer to  the diverter]  Call Store  ~~~~~~~~~~  The equipment unit of an Electronic Switching System that provides temporary  memory storage of information pertaining to call processing & maintenance.  Call Waiting  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  The custom calling service adored by millions that provides a tone burst  to a customer on an established call when a second call has been directed  to that line. The notification tone is heard only by the called customer,  whereas the incoming caller hears regular ringing. The customer can place  the existing call on hold, connect to the calling party, and then repeat  the procedure to reestablish the original connection. This operation can  be done ad nauseum.

Many information channels can be carried by one broad-  band carrier system. Common types of carrier systems are frequency-division,  in which each info. channel occupies an assigned portion of the frequency  spectrum, and time-division, in which each info. channel uses the trans-  mission medium for periodic assigned time intervals.  Carterfone Decision  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The MONUMENTAL decision made by the FCC in 1968 to the effect that telco  customers should be allowed to connect their own equipment (i.e.  DATA MODEMS) to the public telenetwork provided that this interconnection  not adversely affect the telco's operations or the utility of the tele-  phone system to others. Prior to this wonderful decision, only telco  provided equipment could be hooked up to the network. Let's take a  few moments to thank the Modem Deity for Equal Access.  CCH                 See Connections per Circuit Hour  ~~~                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  CCIS                See [yawn] Common Channel Interoffice Signaling  ~~~~                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  CCITT               See Intl.

The operator secures the calling  number from the customer and keys the number into the centralized  automatic message accounting equipment.  Centralized Intercept Bureau (CIB)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  That type of bureau that is part of an Automatic Intercept System and is  associated with one or more automatic intercept centers. It provides  facilities whereby operators situated at auxiliary service positions  furnish assistance to calling customers whose calls have been intercepted  and who require help beyond that furnished by the auto. intercept center.  Centrex  ~~~~~~~  A service for customers with many stations that permits station-to-station  dialing, one listed directory # for the customer, direct inward dialing  to a particular station, and station identification on outgoing calls.  The switching functions are performed in a central office.  Channel  ~~~~~~~  A transmission path between two points. The term channel may refer to a  one-way path or, when paths in the two directions of transmission are  always associated, to a 2-way path. It is usually the smallest subdivision  of a transmission system by means of which a single type of communication  service is provided, i.e., a voice channel, teletypewriter, or data channel.  Channel Bank  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  Channel terminal equipment used for combining (multiplexing) channels on a  frequency-division or time-division basis. Voice channels are combined into  12- or 24-channel groups.  Channel Busy Tone  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An audible signal indicating that a call cannot be completed because of  trunk or switching system blocking. The tone is applied 120 times per  minute. Also called fast busy or (the ever-popular reorder) tone.  CIB                 See Centralized Intercept Bureau  ~~~                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Circuit  ~~~~~~~  (1) A communication path between two or more points.  (2) A network of circuit elements, such as resistors, inductors, capacitors,      semiconductors, etc., that performs a specific function.  (3) A closed path through which current can flow.  (4) A term no 'philter' would ever dream of asking.  Circuit Order  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The document used to transmit engineering design of a public telephone  network trunk or special-service circuit to the department that  implements the design.

See Coherent Modulation System or a physicist near you.  Coin-First Service  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Coin telephone service in which an initial rate deposit is required to  obtain a dial tone. Coin-first service is being replaced by dial-tone-  first, an improved service requiring additional functions in the station  and in the switching system. (Thus the BIOC concept that areas with  coin-first fortress phones are served by older switches.)  Coin Relay  ~~~~~~~~~~  A relay in a coin telephone that collects or returns the coins under the  control of the central office. This relay is activated by CO tones,  and in areas that do not use out-of-band signaling, Red Box tones can  mean free calls by activating this relay.  Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  This is as precise a definition as I could find. I remember on Phreak Klass  2600 (in 806), the arguments used to rage as to what CCIS is and how  it negates or prevents boxing. Sigh. I'll go into all that here, since  CCIS is one of the Top Five most-likely Philter Questions.  CCIS is a signaling system, developed for use between stored program  switching systems (i.e., ESS et alia), in which all of the signaling info.  for a group of trunks (i.e., operator or 'blue box' MF tones, Green and  Red tones) is transmitted over a dedicated high-speed data link, rather  than on a per-trunk basis (i.e. inband signaling, whereby tones  were actually 'shuttled' on your voice trunk). CCIS can reduce call setup  time and save money (yeah!) compared with individual trunk signaling.  That is the definition. Now, you may wonder what the difference  is between out-of-band signaling and CCIS. Alright, though some will  say that they're the same, that's not quite so. CCIS is out-of-band, but  out-of-band is not always CCIS. Got that? That is to say, out-of-band  is the generic label of signaling that occurs outside the voiceband.  This method usually places signaling at frequencies beyond the voice  frequencies, but not necessarily on a dedicated-trunk (CCIS). Thus,  per-trunk signaling COULD be out-of-band. CCIS, on the other hand,  devotes a separate trunk to signaling data. Thus, all such signaling  is carried over a trunk separate from the voice trunk. This is out-of-  band in a sense, then. The following is a letter I wrote to 2600 Mag. and  their response. It's not too explicit, but it may help clarify a touch.  Dear 2600:       In the course of two years of telecom, I've read countless Gfiles  which describe the (virtual) spectrum of 'boxes'. Yet few files give  a clear explanation as to why boxing is impossible in many electronic  switching offices. Would you mind explaining CCIS, and just how this  'prevents' boxing? Thanks.  Reply: "Put quite simply, it's impossible to blue box in an electronic  switching office under CCIS because the equivalent of the blue box tones  that a phreak would send are transmitted over a completely different line.  Since you don't have access to these lines, blue boxing no longer works.  This is ALSO called out-of-band signaling."  Common Control  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An automatic arrangement in which items of control equipment in a switching  system are shared; they are associated with a given call only during the  periods required to accomplish the control functions. All Bell System  Crossbar and ESS systems have common control. This is in contrast to the  individual relays of Strowger switching.  Common-Control Switching Arrangement (CCSA)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An arrangement in which switching for a private network is provided by one  or more common-control switching systems. The switching systems may be  shared by several private networks and also may be shared with the public  telephone network.  Common Language Code  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Codes used to ensure uniform abbreviation of equipment and facility names,  places, place names, etc. (Be nice to get ahold of a summary...anyone?)  Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Created by authorization of Congress in the Communications Satellite Act  of 1962. This private corporation (NOT any agency of the U.S. Government,  though subject to governmental regulation) was created primarily to  provide for the establishment, operation, and management of a commercial  communications satellite system. COMSAT presently acts as manager for  INTELSAT and also represents the U.S. in INTELSAT.  Community Dial Office (CDO)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A small automatic switching system that serves a separate exchange area  having its own numbering plan and ordinarily having no operating or  maintenance force located in its own building; operation is handled and  maintenance is directed from a conveniently located and beautifully  landscaped point referred to as an operator office.  Compandor  ~~~~~~~~~  An abbreviation for compressor-expandor. A device used to compress the  range of talker volumes at the input to a carrier system (in particular,  to increase low-level talker volumes) and to expand the received volumes  at the output of the carrier system (to provide complementary function  and to make the transmission system transparent). This technique improves  the signal-to-noise ratio for low-level talkers and provides a  substancially reduced received noise level during the so-called quiet  intervals. A miracle, really.  Compandor Mistracking  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If this shows up on a philter, leave me mail. Mistracking refers to the  failure of the expandor-characteristic of a compandor to complement  exactly the compressor-characteristics, thereby causing signal distortion.  COMSAT              See Communications Satellite Corporation  ~~~~~~              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Concentration  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  (1) Applies to a switching network (or portion thereof) that has more      inputs than outputs.  (2) In a traffic network, combining calls arriving on many lines or trunks      to transmit them more efficiently in a trunk group.  (3) Locating as much equipment as possible at a given place to achieve      economies in such things as building costs, maintenance, etc.  (4) Something VERY difficult to maintain when reading tech. manuals.  Connecting Arrangement  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The implementation for connecting arrangement service. A connecting  arrangement consists of an interconnecting unit, a Technical Reference,  and a tariff offering.  Connecting Arrangement Service  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A service providing electrical connection to the public telenetwork of  customer-provided equipment.

(Great SE term!)  Connection  ~~~~~~~~~~  (1) A point where a junction of two or more conductors is made.  (2) Generally, a telfo connection is a 2-way voiceband circuit completed      between two points by means of one or more switching systems. It      contains two loops and may contain one or more trunks.  Connections per Circuit Hour (CCH)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An indication of holding time of calls. Under normal circumstances, ACH=  CCH which is about equal to 6 in busy hour for trunk groups excluding  high-usage groups.  Connector  ~~~~~~~~~  In Step-by-Step switching systems, a 2-motion electromechanical switch that  operates on the last two digits of the telephone number to connect from a  selector to any one of 100 customer loops. The connector performs the  following functions:  o Tests for busy  o If busy, returns busy tone  o If idle, rings the called party and returns ringback tone to calling line  o Provides a supervisory signal indicating that answer has occurred and    trips ringing  o Provides talking battery to the calling line on intraoffice calls and    to the called line  o Disconnects when the customer hangs up  Construction Program  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A detailed plan of placement, removal, and rearrangement of facilities to  modernize and expand the capacity of the facilities network.  Conversion (Converting)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  In signaling, the substitution of one, two, or three digits for received  digits for the purpose of directing the call through the next office.  Coordinate Network  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A switching network consisting of incoming and outgoing talking paths  arranged at right angles to each other with fine-motion or electronic  switching elements at intersections.  CORNET Network  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A private telephone network serving Western Electric and Bell Laboratories;  CORNET is a contraction of corporate network. This network uses common-  control switching arrangements (CCSA).  Country Code  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  The 1-, 2-, or 3-digit number that, in the world numbering plan, identifies  each country or integrated numbering plan in the world. The initial digit  is always the world-zone number. Any subsequent digits in the code further  define the designated geographic area (normally identifying a specific  country). On an international call, the country code is dialed before  the national number.  Coupler  ~~~~~~~  An alternate name for an interconnecting unit.  CPSK                See Coherent Phase-Shift Keying  ~~~~                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Crossbar Switch  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The basic element of any Crossbar System. A crossbar switch is a relay  mechanism consisting of 10 horizontal paths and 10 or 20 vertical paths.  Any horizontal path can be connected to any vertical path by means  of magnets. A 2-stage operation is used to close any crosspoint. First, a  selecting magnet shifts all selecting fingers in a horizontal row, then a  holding magnet shifts a vertical actuating card to close the selected  contacts.  Crosspoint Array  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An arrangement of switching elements used in some switching networks,  characterized by incoming and outgoing talking paths arranged at right  angles to each other, with switching elements at intersections.  Crosstalk  ~~~~~~~~~  Undesired power coupled into a communications circuit from other communi-  cations circuits.

CLASS is one of the Bell Network's futuristic  services meant to prop-up profits and presumably make the customers' lives  a little better. This service includes such features as call-blocking  and filtering, coded/priority ringing, and customer-accessible ANI on  incoming callings. CLASS is but one facet of the ultimate telco network,  ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network).  Customer-Premises Equipment  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Equipment normally installed on the customer's premises, such as telephone  sets, key telephones, PBX's, etc.  Customer Trouble Report Analysis Plan (CTRAP)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A plan that provides manual and mechanized procedures for recording troubles  reported by customers and analyzing the reports to obtain statistical data  regarding customer service._______________________________________________________________________________~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~That's about it for Volume II.
