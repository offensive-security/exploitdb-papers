As I'm writingthis in late July, the MURPHY'S LAW album won't be out till November, C.O.C.won't be out until October, and the "Live In N.Y.C. '91" video won't be outuntil September.  So don't go badgering your local alternative record shop forthe above releases....AGNOSTIC FRONT, SICK OF IT ALL, GORILLA BISCUITS: Live in NYC '91 video(In-Effect)     In January of 1991, the fourth annual "Superbowl of Hardcore" was held atThe Ritz in New York City.  Three of the bands that played, AF, SOIA, and GBwere filmed for this video.  You should know that it was done on video and notfilm, so don't be expecting grade-A quality from this.  The live segments aresolid, good sound, many different angles, fans of the bands will love it. Plus, you get interviews with members of the above three bands, along withNuclear Assault, Cro-Mags, and Murphy's Law talking about everything you everwanted to know about hardcore.  At fifty-eight minutes, this is a must for anyNYHC fan, not to mention a good introduction for anyone curious about hardcore.CORROSION OF CONFORMITY   (Combat)     C.O.C. were always on the metal side of hardcore, and now, with theirfirst new album in four years, they've gone way metal.  There is some goodmaterial here.  Slow, creepy, BLACK SABBATH stuff, but a lot of it is justMETALLICA rip-offs.  This is going to sell solely because of the band name, notthe songs.  Still, I have a hunch that I'm really going to love this six monthsfrom now.DOWN BY LAW   (Epitaph)     What you've got here is hardcore legend Dave Smalley (DYS, DAG NASTY, ALL)teaming up with members of the band CHEMICAL PEOPLE.  The result is a verycatchy bunch of melodic hardcore tunes.  It's all pretty poppy, most of thesongs have sappy little hooks, everything moves along nicely paced by a speedysurf beat.  If anything, it sounds like early Dag Nasty.  The main fault I seewith this is that it really doesn't break new ground.  Smalley (who wrotepractically all the music and lyrics) is just re-hashing old business.  Thiswould have been a lot more exciting five years ago.  Still, I can't deny thefact that this album rocks!DYS: Fire & Ice/Wolfpack (on compact disc)   (Taang!)     This isn't new material but a re-issue of the two DYS albums.  For all youyoungsters out there, DYS were one of the first major straight-edge bands,along with fellow Bostonians SS DECONTROL.  So, on this compact disc you getthe first album, "Wolfpack", which is really the "Brotherhood" 12" with 3 extratracks.  "Wolfpack" is some really gnarly insane hardcore.  Horrible playing,horrible production, horrible singing, but hey, it was 1982, what did youexpect?  It's pretty crappy by today's standards, but a classic nonetheless. It definitely provided the blueprint for future SE bands like YOUTH OF TODAY.Around 1984-85, most of the big Boston HC bands like DYS, SSD, FU's and GangGreen incorporated a metallic influence into their sound.  A kind ofSABBATH/MAIDEN 70's metal sound.  "Fire & Ice" is the infamous "DYS metalalbum" which everyone really HATED when it came out.  However, listening to itin 1991, DYS were definitely ahead of their time.  Just as their first albuminspired countless SE bands, "Fire & Ice" no doubt inspired numerous metallichardcore outfits.  You also get a booklet full of lyrics, but no pictures.JAWBOX: Grippe   (Dischord)     Dischord never ceases to amaze.  I thought the HOLY ROLLERS debut wasgood, but this album is incredible!  I suppose you could describe Jawbox ashard-driving college rock with good hooks and a Dischord feel.  This is amust-have.  The one liability to this band is bassist Kim Colleta.  She can'tplay for shit, but don't worry, the bass is mixed way down.  If they're willingto give up their D.I.Y. ethics, Jawbox could probably get signed to a majorlabel within the next few years.LEEWAY: Desperate Measures   (Profile)     Leeway, along with AGNOSTIC FRONT and CRO-MAGS, was one of the firsthardcore bands to come out with a strong metallic sound.  Leeway's 1987 debut,"Born To Expire", didn't impress me too much but I thought they had a lot ofpotential.  Now with this new album, they progressed greatly, but I'm still notsatisfied.  The song "Stand For" is the best song on the album, and an exampleof what they should try to do more of.  When they want to, Leeway can come upwith some really dynamic original material, but too many times they resort tothe old "stomp stomp mosh" chugga-chugga guitar parts which have nopersonality.  This is enjoyable, but I'm waiting for the next one.MURPHY'S LAW: The Best Of Times   (In-Effect)     New York's Murphy's Law return with their third LP, and if you thought thelast one, "Back With A Bong!" was wild, this one is ten times better than thatalbum (which is ten times better than the first one).  The two brothers fromFISHBONE, Fish and Norwood are producing, and other members of Fishbone playhorns on some songs.  Also, Angelo of Fishbone sings "Ebony + Ivory" withJimmy.  Other covers include the "Monster Mash" and even a James Brown song!There're only two songs that can be considered hardcore, "Did You Play War",and "Harder Than Who", the rest is a combination of rock, ska, and funk.There're also two "screwing around in the studio" songs at the end.  This albumis seriously recommended for a raging party, as with this release, Murphy's Lawfirmly establish themselves on the A-List of party bands along with Fishboneand the Red Hots.PRIMUS: Sailing The Seas Of Cheese   (Interscope)     I don't have a lot to say about this.  One thing I can say is that this isNOT, I repeat, is NOT "metal-funk".  For some reason, Primus have been lumpedin with RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, FAITH NO MORE, FISHBONE (not that those bandssound anything alike) as "funk".  Primus have a truly unique sound.  There isno adequate term I can come up with to describe the music.  There is no bandthat sounds anything like Primus.  I'm not even sure if I like this album, butit's certainly original.CHUCK TREECE: Dream'n   (Caroline)     Chuck Treece has been in so many different bands (most notably UNDERDOG)playing so many different instruments that it was only a matter of time beforehe recorded a solo album.  This is certainly a solo album.  He produced it,wrote all the songs, played all the music, and did all the singing.  Well, it'shard rock, kinda like the last BAD BRAINS album.  Some reggae and ska, this isreally more impressive than good.  I hope he gets back in a band soon.YOUTH BRIGADE: Sink With Kalifornija   (BYO)     Following Dischord's example of putting everything a band has everrecorded (or in this case, almost everything) on one compact disc, BYO presentsthe YOUTH BRIGADE discography.  Made up of the three Stern brothers, YouthBrigade will always be famous for appearing in the "Another State of Mind"movie, and they were always an extremely popular band in LA.  They play a basicpunk style, nothing really too distinctive.  The best part about the band wasShawn Stern's voice.  On the CD you get the "Sound and Fury" LP, "What Price"EP, tracks from various BYO compilations, and songs from Youth Brigade's lastshow in 1985.  Included is a booklet with lyrics and a history of the band.Luckily, The CD completely ignores the putrid THE BRIGADE, which consisted ofthe three Stern brothers trying a radically different sound.  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |Copr. 1991 cDc communications by The Pusher            08/31/91-#183|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
