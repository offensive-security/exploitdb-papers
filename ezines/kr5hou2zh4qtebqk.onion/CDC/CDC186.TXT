Stagnant, strangled by commercialism,it has fattened itself at the table of mediocrity, while the public feeds onscraps left over from distant eras of musical plenty.  With more and more starswarbling sweetly in praise of soft drinks, with more and more college radiodarlings dishing up folksy gruel, with more and more doddering prog rockersback from the grave to haunt them, kids all over America are itching forsomething loud and rude and ragged.  Something like early Elvis.  Somethinglike Hendrix or the Sex Pistols.     Something like... rap.     Rap has what rock and roll desperately needs.  It has sauce, strut, andsoul.  It has a big beat, and a message.  It also has an image that manyconsumers can't abide.  Tell ten white suburbanites you think rap is def,and nine will check to make sure their wallet is still there.  (The tenthwill smile sweetly and say, "What a pity.  How long have you been hard ofhearing?")     This is unfortunate on many levels.  In addition to the raising of oldracial specters, mainstream ignorance also deprives mainstream culture ofthe energy of rap, and of the broader stimulus of the hip-hop culture towhich rap is tied.  For roughly ten years, even as such English acts asM/A/R/R/S and Wee Papa Girls have dipped freely into the wells of contemporaryblack music, white America has been turning itself out from the passionateeloquence of Grandmaster Flash, Kurtis Blow, L.L. Cool J, and the latest waveof innovators-Masters of Ceremony, Stetsasonic.     Perhaps this will change.  Perhaps the Beastie Boys will prove to be theElvises of rap-the inevitable white catalysts necessary for exploding blackmusic innovations into Anglo ears.  But it has certainly taken long enough toput rap on the map.  Rap has been around a long time.  Longer than the sixyears since Grandmaster Flash recorded "The Message."  Or the ten years sincethe Sugar Hill Gang set New York street rhymes to rhythm on vinyl.     Arguably, rap is as old as black music itself.  The African tribesmansinging his "Song Of Self Praise" on _Bulu Songs From the Cameroon_ and theemcee puffing his chest out in Stetsasonic's "In Full Gear" have one thing incommon: They're both rappers.  Rap music, with its heavily accented drumpatterns, its syncopated handclaps, and, most important, its vocals-chantedrather than sung, usually in rhymed couplets-is among the oldest of blackmusics.  These underlying ideas of singsong, sometimes extemporaneousstorytelling, sparse percussion, and stamping meters have survived the journeyfrom the African savanna to the graffiti-scrawled projects of New York's SouthBronx.     AFRIKA BAMBAATAA: "You gotta remember that rap goes all the way back toAfrica.  There have always been different styles of rappin', from the Africanchants to James Brown to Shirley Ellis in the '60s doin' 'The Clapping Song.' There's Isaac Hayes, there's Barry White, there's Millie Jackson, thatlove-type rappin', and there's the Last Poets.  And then there's your 'dozens,'that black people used to play in the '30s and '40s.  The dozens is when youtryin' to put the other guy down, talkin' about his mama, his sister, hisbrother, sayin' it in rhyme.  These days, rap is made up of funk, heavy metal,soca [soul calypso], African music, jazz, and other elements.  You can doanything with rap music; you can go from the past to the future to what'shappenin' now."     The instrumentation has changed over the years, naturally.  Where thehereditary minstrels of Morocco, Tunisia, and western Sudan accompaniedthemselves with stringed instruments, modern emcees are backed by drummachines, samplers, and turntable manipulation, or "scratching."  But thehums, grunts, and glottal attacks of central Africa's pygmies, the tongueclicks, throat gurgles, and suction stops of the Bushmen of the KalahariDesert, and the yodeling, whistling vocal effects of Zimbabwe's m'bira playersall survive in the mouth percussion of "human beatbox" rappers like Doug E.Fresh and Darren Robinson of the Fat Boys.  On Fresh's "The Original Human BeatBox," the Fat Boys' "Human Beatbox," Run-D.M.C.'s "Hit It Run," the intro toStetsasonic's "Stet Troop '88," the fadeout of Biz Markie's "Make The MusicWith Your Mouth Biz," and dozens of other records, emcees use their mouths toemulate scratching, Simmons toms, gated snares, and sampled sounds.     DARREN "HUMAN BEATBOX" ROBINSON, FAT BOYS: "That's still the best part ofour concerts, when I do a 'human beatbox' solo.  It lasts for about a minute,and our sound man beefs it up with delay so that it keeps going, doubles it.  Iused to live in Brooklyn, and my family didn't have much money.  I wanteddeejaying equipment like the other kids had, but I couldn't get it, so I juststarted playing the beat with my mouth.  It just came naturally; I'd bestandin' outside and I'd hear a record on the radio or somethin' like that, andI'd just try to play the beat with my mouth.  People started likin' it.  Thenwe won a rapping contest at Radio City Music Hall."     Not only did rap play a vital role in African tribal life, but it appearsin nearly every aspect of the Afro-American musical experience as well.  Thesame emphatic rhymes, stuttering rhythms, and ribald, often downright raunchy,sense of humor that characterize today's rap records crop up in the work songsof the antebellum South, driven by the rhythms of a chopping axe, a poundingpestle, or the sad clink of prison chains.  And the same responsorialvocalizing and "handclapping with offbeat syncopation" in the games of slavechildren that ethnomusicologist Ashenafi Kebede described in _Roots of BlackMusic_, would be right at home on any number of rap records.  Early echoes ofthe genre can be heard in the moans and groans of gospel vocalists, the hoarsewhoops of blues shouters, the expressionistic scatting of such jazz singers asBetty Carter, Eddie Jefferson, and Louis Armstrong, in doowop routines onstreetcorners, in Bo Diddley belting "I'm a Man," in Chuck Berry wisecracking"No Money Down," in the jazz-backed recitations of Gil Scott-Heron.     Not only that, but rap appears in non-musical contexts as well.  Rap isthe exhortations of tent show evangelists, put-down battles in Harlem poolhalls, the slangy, scatological monologues of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor,the sharp-tongued, tightly-rhymed speeches of Jesse Jackson, who, appropriatelyenough, is himself the subject of a 12"-"Run Jesse Run," sung by Lou Rawls,Phyllis Hyman, and the Reverend James Cleveland.  Rap is Muhammed Ali reelingoff rhymes about his opponents, Martin Luther King moving thousands to tears,Malcolm X pounding his fist in righteous fury.  Rap even existed behind bars,in the poetic stories, or "toasts," that circulated among black prisoners.  Thepractically unbroken line that leads from cellblock toasting to contemporaryrapping is underscored dramatically by Schooly D's "Signifying Rapper," a cutfrom 1988's _Smoke Some Kill_ that gives a nod to one of the oldest andbest-known toasts, "The Signifying Monkey."     Two of the most obvious precedents for modern rappers are the hipsters ofthe '30s and '40s and the "personality jocks" of '40s, '50s, and '60s radio. The image of swing-era bandleader Cab Calloway decked out in a flapping zootsuit, whipping his long greasy forelock around and trading hepcat licks - "Lookout, now... skipndigipipndibobopakoodoot!" - with his clarinet player speaksvolumes about the connections between jive and rap.  Calloway's best-knowroutine, "Minnie The Moocher," uses call-and-response "hi-de-hi-de-ho"s similarto the singer-audience interaction one hears at rap concerts.  As British musicwriter David Toop notes in _The Rap Attack_, "Bandleaders like Cab Callowayoccupied a role somewhere between the piano-playing leaders like Duke Ellingtonand Count Basie and the masters of ceremonies who used jive talk and rhymingcouplets to introduce the acts-one of the strongest links with hip-hop, whichstarted out with rappers talking on the microphone about the skill of the discjockey."  Toop offers a tongue-tangling monologue from one of those swing-eraemcees, Ernie "Bubbles" Whitman, as evidence:    "Yessirree, send me that ballad from Dallas.    I'm floating on a swoonbeam.    And right now to keep the beat bouncing right along,    Here's a zootful snootful called 'Mr. Chips,'    As it is fleeced and released by Billy Eckstine    And his trilly tune-tossers.  Toss it, Billy, toss it!"     It's easy to see why rappers are still called emcees-"masters ofceremonies."  Nearly every hip-hop group has an "M.C." somebody.  One group-Masters Of Ceremony-even took its name from the genre that gave birth tobantering, back-talking word-spinners like Whitman.  And it's probably noaccident that one of Stetsasonic's three emcees goes by the handle Daddy-O,also the name of a Chicago deejay-Daddy-O Daylie-whose on-the-air patterrolled jive talk, jazz vocables, the jittery rhythms of bebop and the MadHatter humor of the reefer smoker into a House of Mirrors reflection of theEnglish language.  Daylie and disc jockeys like him-Al Benson ("The MidnightGambler"), also out of Chicago, Maurice "Hot Rod" Hulbert out of Memphis, Dr.Hep Cat out of Austin, Dr. Daddy-O out of New Orleans, Douglas "Jocko"Henderson ("The Ace From Space") out of New York, and countless others-bridgedthe gaps between platters with machine-gunned syllables that came spittingthrough the static and into black living rooms across the States.  It wasgreasier than ribs soaking through a brown paper bag, slicker than a snap-downfedora, hipper than a diamond stickpin in a handpainted necktie.  It was black.It was raw.  It was rap.  And although payola scandals and changing tasteseventually brought down the jive jocks, their rat-a-tat rhymes, bawdy jokes,and onomatopoetic slang live on in the records of L.L. Cool J, M.C. Lyte, DanaDane, Roxanne Shante, Big Daddy Kane, M.C. Shan, and many, many more.     SULIAMAN EL-HADI, THE LAST POETS: "'Rap,' in our vernacular, just meant'talk,' like 'Dig this man.  I wanna slide past your crib and rap withyou.'"     GRANDMASTER FLASH: "You gotta realize this: We don't want to sound likeR&B or pop or jazz or calypso or opera; we wanna sound like us.  And if thatmeans taking an opera 'hit' with a funk foot and a jazz melody line and puttin'the whole ball of wax together with some rap on top of it, then that's whatwe've gotta do!  And we're the only ones who can do it as blatantly as we doit.  We might use a Roland bass drum with a James Brown snare and a Sly And theFamily Stone melody line with an orchestra hit from an opera record, you know?"     Since its beginnings in the early '70s, rap has been bootleg art.  Itis significant that the first rap record-"King Tim III (Personality Jock),"released on the Spring label in 1979 by a Brooklyn-based funk outfit called theFatback Band, probably lifted its hooky chorus and tuneful bassline from RoyAyres' "Running Away."  And it is only fitting that a current rap hit like"Beat Dis" by Bomb The Bass amounts to a witty string of stolen sounds bouncingoff an infectious bass riff and a pulverizing drumbeat.  Gehr, in a May '88Artforum article, tallies some of the song's quotes: "The Dragnet theme, JamesBrown, Aretha Franklin, Prince, Hugo Montenegro playing Ennio Morricone'sthemes from The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, the Bar-Kays' wah-wah guitar rifffrom Son Of Shaft... a Russian voice inviting the listener to play roulette...and a takeoff on BBC-style how-to records (swiped from a previous Coldcutdisc)."     MATT BLACK, Coldcut: "It's like the whole history of recorded sound iswaiting there for us to murder."     Like the Sex Pistols' scabrous deconstruction of Chuck Berry's "JohnnyB. Goode," or Jimi Hendrix' splattery, spinart rendering of "The Star-SpangledBanner," Bomb The Bass' cut-up of funk, TV voice-overs, movie music,instructional records, and Prince questions all of our assumptions about musicin specific and art in general.  Is swiping other artists' riffs andrecontextualizing them a stroke of dadaistic genius or a sign of conceptualbankruptcy?  Is sampling, as Stetsasonic's Daddy-O suggests, a form of art initself, or just a polite name for stealing?  How you define "art," or whetheryou bother to define it, depends on whether you live in SoHo or the South Bronx _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/     The South Bronx has a rat problem.  Dubbed "super rats" by the media,these hearty rodents have developed a hereditary resistance to pesticides.According to one official, they can consume approximately ten times the amountof poison required to kill an ordinary rat.  "They eat the back of the sofas,they eat the curtains," laments one interviewee in a recent televisiondocumentary.  "They're bas big as cats.  Some of 'em are as big as dogs."  Thecamera eye follows a procession of big-bellied, long-tailed somethingssqueaking and scuttling through the rubbish.     Rats aren't the borough's only problem.  Riding the Number 6 or Number2 IRT subway lines north past 149th Street, one flashes along elevated track,past cratered pavement, dilapidated roofs, and fire-gutted buildings whosebroken windows stare blankly, the eyeless sockets of concrete skulls.  Aseemingly endless vista of projects, tenements, and potholed avenues litteredwith rusting car carcasses, this is the apocalyptic landscape that inspiredFort Apache: The Bronx.  These are the rubble-strewn streets where Jimmy Carterand Ronald Reagan stopped and made long speeches about urban blight.  And thisis the birthplace of rap music.    "Broken glass, everywhere, people pissing on the stairs,     You know they just don't care.     I can't take the smell, can't take the noise,     Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice.     Rats in the front room, roaches in the back,     Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat.     I tried to get away but I couldn't get far,     'cause the man from Prudential repossessed my car.     Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge,     I'm tryin' not to lose my head.     It's like a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder,     How I keep from going under."                             --Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five,                               "The Message"     In the '70s, when disco held sway and gold-neckchained nightclubberspacked Manhattan's Studio 54 and New York, New York, Grandmaster Flash-then Joseph Saddler-couldn't get past the doormen.  Neither could fellowBronx resident Afrika Bambaataa, Harlemite Kurtis Blow (born Curtis Walker),or hundreds of uptown teenagers like them.  The glitterati had no desire torub elbows with scruffy, streetwise youth.     BILL ADLER: "The reason that Public Enemy called their first album Yo!Bum Rush The Show is because that's what they were forced to do-bum rush.See, the buppies are guarding the door to the disco.  [Public Enemy emceeand main mouthpiece] Chuck D. and his crew roll up in sneakers and they'renot going to be allowed to get in.  Chuck says, 'Fuck it.  We bum-rushin'!'Meaning, 'We're coming in anyway!'"     D.M.C. [DARRYL MCDANIELS]: "When rap was startin 'with GrandmasterFlash and them, it was just before disco was dyin', around '73, '74.  Us kidsin the streets couldn't get into those places and everybody wanted to be a discjockey, so we took our turntables to the streets.  They had their discothequesand we had our discoparks."     Kids headed for spinning parties in Harlem and the Bronx.  There, inbars, community centers, after-hours clubs, gyms, old ballrooms, and publicparks, mobile deejays, hired by promoters, worked the crowd with a bandleader'ssense of pacing, slowing the mood with sultry ballads or revving things up with120-beats-per-minute sizzlers.     Individual stars began to shine-jocks like Maboya, Eddie Cheeba, andClub 371 regular D.J. Hollywood, whose call-and-response exhortations andscat-style talkovers ["Hip, hop, de hip be de hop, de hiphop, hip de hop, onand on and on and on..."] made him an audience favorite.     Kurtis Blow, then a student at New York's Music And Art High School,was a fan of Pete "D.J." Jones, a disco-style spinner who wowed crowds-not tomention fellow deejays-with his seamless segues.  Jones, he recalls, was his"first role model," a smooth talker who "rocked the house better than anyone Iever saw."  Meanwhile, Flash, ex-Black Spades gang member Bambaataa, and mostof the teenage population of the South Bronx had fallen under the spell of aJamaican-born jock who styled himself Kool D.J. Herc.     Herc, whose given name was Clive Campbell, blew other deejays out of thedance hall with his megawatt McIntosh amplifier and gargantuan Shure speakers -towering cabinets he dubbed "the Herculords."  Surrounded by gyrating dancershe tagged "B-boys"-a term that has come to refer to any black youth from theBig Apple who knows enough to wear his Puma laces untied and his Kangol hat atthe right angle-Herc paved the way for rap.  Eschewing the disco-derivedpractice of "blending," or fading smoothly from one 12" to another, Herc keptthe dance floor at a sticky-sweaty peak by playing only the "breaks"-thetimbale figures, conga or bongo triplets, cowbell accents and butt-funky howlsthat boomed across the mix when the other instruments dropped out.  By slappingthe same record on two turntables, re-cueing one while the other played, he wasable to turn instrumental passages that were only a few bars in length intosweat-drizzled, hour-long workouts.  The audience loved it.     GRANDMASTER FLASH: "The deejay, in rap, takes the best part of the recordand just keeps cutting it back and forth, back and forth, until he decides tochange the record.  The deejays who were popular in the streets were the oneswho knew how to read a crowd.  All you have is records and two turntables toplay with, so you gotta consider what records you should start with, whatrecords you should use to slowly build, which ones will take them to theorgasmic state, and then how you can bring 'em back down."     Sadly, Herc has faded into obscurity.  His career went into a tailspinafter he was stabbed by an audience member during a gig at The ExecutivePlayhouse.  Nonetheless, his hip-hop style of spinning and "dub"-inspiredmonologues left a lasting imprint on rap.     BAMBAATAA: "Rap started with Kool D.J. Herc; he's the man who brought itinto the nation, from Jamaica.  Our style of rappin' is close to the toastersof reggae, although Herc wasn't a toaster.  Basically, the main three whohelped pioneer this-Kool Herc, myself, and Grandmaster Flash-are all of WestIndian background.  What we did was take what was happenin' in the West Indies,put it to American disco and funk music, and then start rappin' on top of thebeats."     The rap-reggae connection is affirmed by Masters Of Ceremony tracks like"Sexy," "Rock With The Master," "Redder Posse," and "Master Move," fromDYNAMITE, all of which feature a Bronx-born but Jamaican-descended toasternamed Don Barron.  McDaniels, who cut a skanked-up rap tune himself withRun-D.M.C. ["Roots, Rap, Reggae," from KING OF ROCK], states, "Them dub boysis incredible, the way they rhyme, the way their lyrics flow, how they useechoes, the bass lines and the drumbeats.  Them boys is no joke; I know weowe a lot to them."  Silverman seconds the motion: "Historically, the biginfluence on the New York-based hip-hop movement has been Caribbean andJamaican music.  I think Bambaataa's mother is Jamaican, Flash has Caribbeanroots, Stetsasonic has a reggae number on every record, even the Fat Boyshave done a reggae rap ["Hard Core Reggae," from FAT BOYS ARE BACK].  We justsigned a girl named Latifah, and she has a record out called 'Princess of thePosse' that has a very heavy reggae groove in it."     The void left by Kool Herc's disappearance was soon filled by Blow, Flash,Bambaataa, and other young deejays.  Of the three, Flash soon emerged as thescene's technical wizard.  A graduate of Samuel Gompers Vocational High Schoolin the Bronx, Flash began deejaying in '75.  He soon realized that Kool Herc'sact had one flaw: Although his mixer had a headphone input jack, he never usedit, dropping the needle into the grooves by eye.     FLASH: "The early hip-hop jocks, when things first started, were hittin'and missin', droppin' the needle and just hopin' that the break was there.It wasn't a perfectly synced thing.  I learned about cueing when I met Pete'D.J.' Jones, who was the hottest deejay of that time.  We became friends, andwhen he would play, I would say to myself, 'How the hell is he mixing hisrecords on time?  He's not missin' a beat!'  So once, when he was taking abreak, he let me take over.  He says, 'Here's the headset,' and I'm thinking,'The headset?  Why is he giving me a headset?'  But then, when I switched [thecue switches for the right and left turntables] back and forth, I says, 'Youcan hear the record before it comes on!'  After I realized that you couldpre-hear what you were doing, it was time to go out into the parks and do it!"     Another brainstorm followed: "punch phrasing," or "cutting," the rhythmicintercutting of sonic bursts from a manually manipulated disc on one turntablewhile a second record was spinning on another.  In a low-tech premonition ofsampling, it allowed Flash and other deejays to drop brass blasts, orchestrahits, and James Brown "Good God!"s into dance tracks, effectively creating newcompositions.  Shortly thereafter, an idea popped into Flash's head that canonly be described as a-pun intended-flash of brilliance: scratching.     FLASH: "Scratching is just cueing the record.  A deejay has to back-cuethe record, but he only hears that sound himself.  We felt, 'Why just let ushear it?  Let's pull the fader halfway up while the other record's stillplaying and make this scratching noise, back and forth, to the beat!'  Atfirst, nobody else was doin' this except me and Grand Wizard Theodore, whoalso helped with the evolution of scratching.  After I popularized it in myarea, I started playing at Bronx clubs like Club 371.  It worked so well that,slowly but surely, it caught on like the plague."     The abrasive, grainy wukka-wukka of a stylus whipping back and forth-heard for the first time by much of white America on Herbie Hancock's goldsingle, "Rockit," from FUTURE SHOCK-has become rap's trademark, as emblematicof the genre as whammy bar orgasms and two-handed tapping are of mainstreammetal.  Almost any rap track can be stripped down to the bare-bones essentialsof a declaiming emcee and the swishing, swooshing sound of a deejay scratching.As McDaniels puts it, "Look, Run-D.M.C. is just two turntables, a mixer, astage, a crowd, and a microphone.  Nothing's on tape; all of it is done byrecords.  It started with deejays and emcees, and Run-D.M.C. is gonna make itend with deejays and emcees."     As individual deejays gathered followings, they began recruiting theirown emcees to sling slang and keep the crowd dancing.  As Flash recalls inHIP HOP: THE ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF BREAK DANCING, RAP MUSIC, AND GRAFFITI,"When people first came to the park, they'd start dancing.  But then everyonewould gather around and watch the deejay.  A block party could turn into aseminar.  That was dangerous.  You needed vocal entertainment to keep everyonedancing.  I used to leave the mic on the other side of the table so anybody whowanted could pick it up."     Early rappers patterned their staccato ejaculations after-who else?-theGodfather of Soul, James Brown.  A quick listen to "(Get Up, I Feel Like BeingA) Sex Machine," "Say It Loud-I'm Black And I'm Proud," and "My Thang," fromJAMES BROWN/SOLID GOLD 30 GOLDEN HITS, offers a crash course in rap cliche's. It's no mistake that such Bambaataa efforts as UNITY and THE LIGHT featureBrown.  Nor is it mere coincidence that Full Force, the production crew behindLisa Lisa & Cult Jam, the Real Roxanne, and other hip-hop-flavored pop acts,recently jumped at the opportunity to work with Brown on his latest album, I'MREAL.  Lyrically and musically, Brown is in many ways the founding father ofhip-hop.  His bass lines, drum licks, and trademark sobs, yips, grunts, andgroans have found their way into innumerable rap numbers, from Spoonie Gee's"The Godfather" to Sweet T's "I Got Da Feelin'" to Kool Moe Dee's "How Ya LikeMe Now," and on and on.  Kurtis Blow surely speaks for all of hip-hop when hesays, "James has that anticipated swing beat that's called soul.  No one elsein music history has captured it like he has."     A subtler, but equally pervasive, influence on rap emcees has been theLast Poets, a raw-talking, fiercely political combo founded in 1968 byJalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin.  Mindblowing Poets cuts like "Niggers Are ScaredOf Revolution" and "When The Revolution Comes," both from THE LAST POETS,cut the die for the current crop of in-your-face rappers like Public Enemy,Boogie Down Productions, and Schooly-D.  Although their spare, bongo-poweredarrangements were a little too jazzy to catch on with the hard-funkin'hip-hoppers, landmark numbers like "Hustler's Convention," released in 1973on Douglas, influenced a generation of rappers.  As Kool Herc himself oncenoted, "The inspiration for rap is James Brown and HUSTLER'S CONVENTION."     Originally a quartet, the group has thinned to a core duo of Nuriddinand Suliaman El-Hadi, who joined in 1971.  Asked to give advice to the movementhe helped spark, El-Hadi observed, "You know, a lot of this is a fad, and ifyou add 'e' to 'fad,' it becomes 'fade.'  Fads fade, but our thing is not atrend that comes to an end, you know what I mean?  I can appreciate all of theyoung brothers and sisters tryin' to do somethin'.  My problem is with thecontent; most of them are not givin' up no message, you know what I mean? They're hung up on a real heavy ego trip.  Everything travels in cycles, and Ithink rap's gotta get back to basics; people are becoming fed up with thenonsense.  They're becoming disillusioned, so I think it's only a matter oftime before they get to basics.  I believe that they wanna slap their feet tothe beat but I think they wanna sing somethin' that means somethin', too."     While early rappers were busy cutting their eyeteeth on James Brown andLast Poets monologues, deejays were mining Manhattan's cut-out bins for obscurenuggets that would make them stand apart from the competition.  AfrikaBambaataa, more than any jock, made a name for himself as "Master Of Records,"quoting from THE MUNSTERS, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, James Brown rarities, andSly Stone freakouts all in the space of a few minutes.  Audiences, in hip-hopparlance, "bugged out."     TOM SILVERMAN: "Bambaataa was spinning at this rap club called theT-Connection up in the Bronx.  He had a business card at that time that said,'Afrika Bambaataa: Master Of Records.'  That was his real claim to fame.  IfBambaataa knows anything, he knows every record that was ever released-rock,jazz, whatever.  He'll use a little lick from Bob James' "Mardi Gras," he'lluse a piece of the Eagles' THE LONG RUN, the Monkees, Billy Squier's BIG BEAT,and so on.  He used to tape over the labels of his records so that nobody couldtell what they were.  The kids would gather around the deejay to watch becausethey wanted to get the records.     "I used to go to a store called Downstairs Records, in New York.  Theyhad a 'beats' room, where they would play old records, cut-outs that theyhad originally gotten for 50 cents or a dollar each and were selling for 15or 20 dollars to little kids from the Bronx who would pool their money togetherto buy them.  These kids would buy the Eagles' LONG RUN just for the threeseconds at the top of a record, just for that little piece with the beat on it!These records weren't readily available, and this was the place you went thathad all the beats.  They'd sell them that way too.  They'd put a sign on THELONG RUN that would say 'Boogie Beat' or something, and everybody would knowwhat that meant.  Every little kid in the Bronx had two turntables; they wereall imitating Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa."     FLASH: "The ultimate goal of a deejay, before hip-hop became a recordedform, was to go out and find record that had danceable drum solos, regardlessof how long they were.  A lot of the records that I used to play, my audienceprobably would never have known that they were by white rock groups.  But witha lot of the white pop songs, they gave the drummer a serious solo, and if youknew your beats-per-minute, you could mix 'em back and forth with the old funkand R&B things and make the marriage work!"     To this day, deejays on the lookout for def breaks can still be foundpawing through the vinyl or jawing with day manager Stanley Platzer at NewYork's Music Factory [1476 Broadway, between 42nd and 43rd, (212)221-1488].There, in neat rows along one wall, are volumes one through 19 of ULTIMATEBREAKS AND BEATS, a legit series of compilation LPs that cram the best beatsonto a single disc.  One volume, for example, includes "Granny's Funky RollsRoyce," "Funky Drummer," "Walk This Way," "Johnny The Fox," "Ashley'sRoachclip," and three other cuts.  There are no artist listings, and volumenumbers are given only on the handlettered cards rubber-banded to each record. As Stanley says, it's the breaks-"the bells, man, the bells"-that matter, andnothing else. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/     Throughout the '70s, recorded rap existed solely in the form of live showstaped on cassette, duped on double decks, and passed from fan to fan.  Then, in1979, with the release of the Sugar Hill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," everythingchanged.  Although "King Tim III (Personality Jock)," the B-side of the FatbackBand's "You're My Candy Sweet," hit the charts earlier that year, it didn'tcause quite the stir "Rapper's Delight" did.  For one thing, more than a few ofthe uptown emcees recognized their own rhymes in "Delight."  It wasn't longbefore the record, with its infectious hook "borrowed" from Chic's "GoodTimes," went gold, selling more than two million copies and slapping the tag"rap" on the genre forever.  Emcees and deejays scrambled to sign with Sylviaand Joe Robinson's New Jersey-based indie, Sugar Hill.     Later that same year, Kurtis Blow's novelty single "Christmas Rappin'"joined the parade of gold rap records.  Its 1980 follow-up, "The Breaks,"went gold as well, putting rap on the musical map and establishing Blow as amajor label presence on an otherwise indie-dominated scene.     BLOW: "The whole society of hip-hop was really new when I did 'TheBreaks.'  I was sort of putting ideas together, trying to keep the whole fadtrue to its roots.  What I tried to do was make the kind of music that Iwould hear in the clubs, and that's how I came up with 'The Breaks.'  Thebreak was the most important part of the record in discos; people would gocrazy when they would get to the break.  We wanted to make a record symbolizingthat, with a lot of different breaks.  Lyrically, I got into the connotationsof a 'good break' or a 'bad break,' philosophically speaking-the breaks in therecord and also the breaks one can get in one's life.  We had an all-star bandback then; real hot musicians.  Jimmy Bralower was the drummer.  The bassistwas Larry Smith, who later became a big producer; he produced the first twoRun-D.M.C. albums and the first four Whodini albums.  He also became mybandleader, with a band that I started in '81 called the Orange Krush band. John Tropea played guitar, and Denzil Miller, who produced two songs on my newalbum, BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND, played keyboards."     In '82, Bambaataa and Flash grabbed for the brass ring and caught it.Bambaataa and his Soulsonic Force got lucky first with "Planet Rock," anunlikely fusion of bleeping, fizzing techno-rock, Zulu surrealism, anddeep-fried funk.     TOM SILVERMAN: "The kids were really getting into Kraftwerk. 'Trans-Europe Express' was big in the ghettoes.  Nobody at Capital Records,Kraftwerk's label, knew anything about it, but Bambaataa used to spin it inhis clubs.  I thought it would be a great idea to use those rhythms and thatkind of a sound in a black record, so Bambaataa and I went into the studiowith Arthur Baker as the producer.  We needed a guy to put synthesizers down,and somebody recommended John Robie, who had a danceable rock record out onthis disco deejay service.  He came over and we went into Intergalactic Studio,which, for $35 an hour, included a Neve board, a Fairlight, a Memorymoog, and aRoland TR-808.  That was pretty much all we used.  We had these giant orchestrahits in the tune, played in polyphony to make them sound even bigger.  Theywere stock sounds from one of the Fairlight disks.  Today, those chords arestill the basis for samples on about 50 other records!  'Planet Rock' sold over600,000 12" singles; it was one of the first four or five gold 12-inches ever."     In sharp contrast to "Planet Rock"'s glacial strings, zapping synths,and quickstepping beatbox, Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five's "TheMessage" seemed like a step backwards.  Inspired in part by Tom Tom Club's1981 single "Genius Of Love," it is a slow, almost plodding tune, prodded alongby a chicken-picked guitar figure, handclaps on the backbeat, burping synthbass, and a descending melody line that seems to echo into a foggy infinity. Its lyrics, by contrast, are crystal clear, a sharp-focus image of inner cityugliness.  To this day, it remains one of rap's most intelligent, scathinglooks at black life in a white-run world.     '83 ushered in "Sucker M.C.s," by Run-D.M.C., and with it, a new brandof "gangster rap" that scrapped the sixteenth-note hi-hats, ringing 9th and6th chords, and slick vocal inflections that hip-hop had carried over fromdisco.  Driven by a booming 808 kick that ripples through the seat of yourpants, power chords that crisp your face, and hollered lyrics that ricochetaround your skull, Run-D.M.C.'s tunes are headbanging rap at its hardest.Taut as coiled whipsteel, tracks like "King Of Rock" and their lashing,smashing cover of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way" opened the door for L.L. CoolJ, the Beastie Boys, and other "hardcore B-boys."     Producer, guitarist, and Def Jam co-owner [now owner of Def American] RickRubin, who handled production chores on L.L. Cool J's RADIO, the Beastie Boys'LICENSE TO ILL, and other chartbusters, has played an important role inhammering out the metal/rap sound that has been largely responsible forcrossing rap over to a broader, whiter demographic. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/                   ["Hip-Hop Primer #2" is concluded in #187]  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |1991 cDc communications by Mark Dery                   08/31/91-#186|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
