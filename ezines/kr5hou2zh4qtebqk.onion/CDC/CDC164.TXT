     Without doubt Friedrich Nietzsche occupies that select plane of the very
finest philosophical minds.  He has delivered in his vast array of writings
some of the most insightful and thought provoking ideas ever communicated. 
Though he scarcely considers BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL to be any representation of
the apogee of his work, it is nevertheless an extraordinary contribution to
the philosophical field and its value should not be discounted.

     It is here in this file that the results of a year's work of translations
from Friedrich Nietzsche's original writing of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL unfolds
into what I hope to be a valuable contemporary interpretation of this
monumental work.   Because of the vast size of this particular tome, I have
selected the highlights of this leviathan work and presented them to you in a
nutshell.

     Without further ado, I hope you enjoy reading this file as much as I
enjoyed pouring over the original and translating it here for your enjoyment.
