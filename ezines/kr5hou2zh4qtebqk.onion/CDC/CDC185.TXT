Roughly half of theplanet's population had died of AIDS, which, curiously, never was cured.  TheBrazillian rain forest has long-since vanished, as have most of the world'strees, leaving a rank, fouled atmosphere hanging like a dark pall over thedying earth.  Every last river, lake, stream and marsh extent has been reducedto a toxic, mercury-laden swill.  The rains that once brought life now seethean acidic death.  The ozone layer is gone; the sun bathes the world in lethaldoses of radiation-everyone, it seems, has some degree of skin cancer, and mostchildren are born with varying degrees of mutation.  But it is unclear whetherthe source is the polluted water, the UV rays from the sun, or the fallout fromthe bombs.     Yes, the bombs... what a bitter disappointment they had been for all.It was secretly hoped that the world would finally end, mercifully, with abang.  But it didn't.  Indeed, a good number of cities were vaporized inblinding flashes on that fateful day in 2029-but the resulting electromagneticpulse knocked out the computers that controlled the remaining missiles, alongwith everything else.  "Mutually Assured Destruction" ended up as a cruel hoax.More like mutually assured misery for the majority that survived.     Deprived then of their lifeblood-electricity-the remaining cities becamedead, decaying, monolithic hulks haunted solely by murderous, marauding gangsas the populace largely abandoned their former lives and set out into theanarchistic unknown in search of... anything else.     It was in this horrific environment that the Christian Reformists seizedpower.     Leeching off of the desperation of the masses, spouting empty promises ofspiritual panaceas, pointing fingers of blame at alleged "sin," they wooedtheir quarry into their cruel slavery by convincing them that they were EVILand needed to be CONTROLLED-supposedly by God, in actuality by arrogant men.     They backed their claim of "divine right" to power with seeming "miracles"-restoring (strictly) limited electricity to towns and cities under theirdominion; eking out a modest food supply with greenhouses and hydroponics;providing relatively purified water; offering unheard-of medical care to thelucky amongst their obedient herd of sheep.  And all that they asked, or ratherdemanded, in return for their benevolence was the utter surrender of theirsubjects' souls-"to Christ."     It was very much like Iran after the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism latein the Twentieth Century.  It differed, however, from that ugly period in thatit was necessary for the Christian Reformists to dispense with a good degree ofthe basis of their supposed faith in order to maintain their ironclad grip onpower.  Things like love, pacifism, compassion-all that wimpy hippy-esquegarbage that Christ made passing references to every now and again.  That hadto go-couldn't wash in an authoritarian society.  Oh sure, they paid lipservice to it all, but ever since the Inquisition, they never felt any realneed to practice it.     For example: AIDS was still a big problem, and an obvious punishment fromGod for man's deviant sexuality, they said.  And, as Paul said, "It is not goodfor a man to touch a woman."  Therefore, sex was expressly forbidden-except forpurposes of procreation only, and even then ONLY amongst married couples whohad sought and received permission from the church elders.  The punishment forviolating this law was summary execution.     (Actually, this was the church's response to their knowledge that sex isthe single most liberating and enlightening human activity there is.  Can'thave the underlings going about expanding their consciousnesses and feeling anyreal love-would breed deviance)     Another capital crime was Blasphemy, and this could be just aboutanything.  It was really just an arbitrary way for the church to rid itself ofpotential troublemakers.  Questioning the church's authority=Blasphemy.  Death.Using the lord's name in vain (and thus calling into question the validity ofthis totalitarian regime-if you don't fear God, how can you fear the church?)=Blasphemy.  Death.  Sort of comparable to the Reign of Terror in post-revolutionary France.     There were countless other ways one could get oneself put before a firingsquad-listening to old recordings of very forbidden "Rock-n-Roll Devil'sMusic"; dancing; kissing or petting amongst unmarried couples; wearing "whore'spaint" (make-up); dressing inappropriately (a very arbitrary deal); reading thewrong kind of books; drawing the wrong kind of pictures.  These weren't reallycapital crimes as such-generally, if you wept and repented and grovelled wellenough before the elders, you'd probably get off with a cut in your food rationfor a couple of weeks.  But if one showed the slightest bit of defiance or lackof remorse, that was it.  Death.     Although outsiders-stragglers who wandered in from other parts of thestill languishing countryside-were frowned upon because they might bring inunorthodox ideas (they were therefore usually expelled from the territory), therealm had a rabid sense of imperialistic expansionism.  That was the commoners'job; their reason for existing-facilitating the cancerous growth of the realmby restoring electric grids to outlying areas, subjugating the indigenous folkin the yet-unwashed towns, indoctrinating the "heathen" children as to theirown twisted brand of Christianity, murdering those who opposed them, etc.  Itwas the new "Manifest Destiny," and it rolled over the countryside like ajuggernaut, ingesting and annihilating everything in its path.     They arrived here, surrounding our once-peaceful little refuge in thesequiet hills, about two years ago.     Our little town of four hundred had already restored electric power to ourhomes long ago, using windmills.  We also used them to drill wells straightdown to the Edwards Aquifer and thus provide fresh, clean water.  We evenrestored RUNNING water and developed a makeshift sewage system-not like thosefoul pits that the Reformists, in their graciousness, bestowed upon theirsubjects.  And WE knew how to use greenhouses too.  We had plenty of food.     So when their emissaries showed up that day, offering us all the wonderfulamenities of their glorious empire in a mere exchange for our souls, we saidthankyouverymuchbutno and figured that was the end of it.  After all, we feltno threat from "Christians."  We were horribly wrong.     Naturally, we had a defense system in place-a militia of sorts and somewell-placed bunkers-to fend off the marauding hordes of "Road Warriors" that wefigured would show up someday.  But there was no way we could have prepared forthis.  No way at all.     Our refusal... infuriated them.  It seemed that most other people hadsuccumbed passively, without question.  We didn't, and we earned their wrath.For three weeks they rained death upon our little town.  The explosions... thefires... the blood literally running in the streets.  I watched them kill myson.  I watched them rape my daughter-in-law, then kill her too.  I watchedthem stringing up children from tree limbs.  I watched them burn my house, andmy neighbors houses too.     And then I watched them strolling into our town, grinning like themindless zombies they are, singing their insipid, meaningless hymns, praisingtheir God for providing them with such a nice place to overrun and occupy. They let me live because I am just a pathetic, pitiful, beaten old man.  I'm nothreat to them.     But then again, I suppose I really am, after all.  Because I still thinkfor myself; I remember the days when one could be free without fear of death-I even remember such times BEFORE the birth of this little oasis that nowserves as my prison.  I remember when there was such a thing as a separation ofchurch and state-put in something called the Constitution of the United Statesof America at the behest of a brilliant man named Thomas Jefferson to keep thissort of thing from ever happening.  And for 240 years, it worked. Two-hundred-and-forty... wonderful years.  Poor Jefferson.  Most peoplenowadays don't even know his name.  The Reformists saw to that, you betcha.     I hate my life.  I hate this empire.  I hate what this world has become. I hate the swaggering, small-minded motherfucking sons of bitches who dictateto our lives.  I hate these blind, vapid fools who go about cooing "God's sooogoood! Isn't God goood?"  Bah!  Tell that to my dead son.     And if there IS a God, then I hate Him, too.              - Dec. 25, 2045. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Inspired by:      - "A Handmaid's Tale"           a novel by Margaret Atwood      - "One Time, One Place"           a poem by Nivek Ogre"Your Tyrant Who Rules...

Some of the girls said they were raped.     About 300 teen-age boys took part in the assault Saturday night at the St.Kizito Mixed Secondary School near Meru, 105 miles northeast of Nairobi.Reports said the girls who died were either trampled or suffocated when theycrammed into small rooms or huddled in corners..."     X-ianity at its foulest.     When I completed and solicited opinions on an earlier, more detailed (andbetter) version of the preceding story-originally titled "Reformation"-arecurring criticism that I heard was something along the lines of      "But Christians don't have a penchant for the kind of violence presentedin this piece.  It's against their dogma."     Nonsense.  I wonder whose history these critics are studying.  Granted,CHRIST had no such taste for violence-I never implied or believed thus."Christians," however, are a different story.  I would point out the estimatedsix-and-a-half MILLION souls offered up in torrents of fire for "heresy" duringthe Dark Ages and the Inquisition.  Or the bloody saga of the "Holy" RomanEmpire.  Or the trail of misery and death left behind by the Crusaders.  Or theChildrens' Crusade, for that matter.  What a concept!  Imagine what it waslike, standing on the shores of the azure Mediterranean, watching the littlebloated bodies wash ashore in a festering, stinking, relentless tide.  Boy,dontcha know Christ musta just been BEAMING over that spectacle!     More recently, I would note the near-orgasmic frenzy that Pat Robertsonwould get worked up into over the wanton slaughter of the Iraqis.  And thecorresponding displays of blind nationalism in churches across this great land-I saw one service on television in which a column of soldiers in FULL BATTLEGEAR came marching up the aisle toward the altar, waving flags and carryingMACHINE GUNS, for God's sake!  I could just hear Christ's screeches.  Whateverhappened to "Love thine enemies," or "Thou shalt not kill"?  Obviously tooinconvenient.     It's not the falling short of Christ's standards that bothers me, it'swhen those standards are utterly dismissed and the perpetrators try to covertheir bloody transgressions with Christ's name and alleged blessing that Ibecome incensed.  _   _   ____________________________________________________________________/((___))\|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.......806/794-1842| [ x x ] |NIHILISM.............517/546-0585|Paisley Pasture.......916/673-8412|  \   /  |Polka AE {PW:KILL}...806/794-4362|Ripco.................312/528-5020|  (' ')  |Tequila Willy's GSC..209/526-3194|The Works.............617/861-8976|   (U)   |====================================================================|  .ooM   |1991 cDc communications by Alien Hin                   08/31/91-#185|\_______/|All Rights Pissed Away.
