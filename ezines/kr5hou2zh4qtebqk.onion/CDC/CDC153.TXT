Watching the pigs die.  Look at them.  Look at theirfaces as the bullets rip through their flesh.  This UZI feels so good in myhands.  My old friend.     Shit man, I am totally unstoppable.  The cops shoot me, again and again,but their bullets just pass through the emptiness of my soul.  I am theTerminator.  I squeeze the trigger and put the last of the pigs to the groundin one mass puddle of carcass, blood, and piss.     I walk into the convenience store.  There's two people hiding behind thecounter, no, wait,....four, including two little kids.  The UZI hums once againand blasts right through them.  I hate killing kids, but then again, I hatekids.  Each drop of blood seems to float through the air in slow motion.  Ipaint the wall behind them crimson, each droplet adding to the masterpiece. It's so beautiful.  I look out the window and see the destruction I've created,and I feel so proud, so tough, so free.  I hear a voice from above.     "Hey, what the fuck ya doin' down there, givin' yourself a blowjob, yafaggot?"     I look up.  It's Nerf.  That's not his real name, but everyone calls himthat.     "Shit, this is the best party I've had in ages, an' your sittin' in thecorner with your head between your knees!  An' you're drinkin' wine coolers! What a faggot!!  Shit, ya really oughta start takin' drugs.  Drop acid, yapussy!!!"     I get up, grab my coat, and walk out.  Nerf's such an asshole.  He's mybest friend.  He's my only friend.  And he knows it.     On the way to my car, I notice three kids sitting on the front lawn.  Irecognize one of them as someone who likes to beat the shit out of me.  I'm notgood at fighting or running, but I'm great when it comes to getting beat up.     "Hey faggot, where ya going?", he says in a drunken voice.  Whenever he'ssaid anything to me, he's been drunk.  I don't think he ever stops drinking. Normally I just keep walking with my eyes to the ground.  But this time I'mreal pissed.     "You got something to say to me, motherfucker?", I say, walking towardshim.  Before he can reply, I go into a spinning back-kick that connects withhis face.  His jaw snaps clean off and slides back into his head like a deskdrawer.  He's dead before he hits the ground.  Everyone starts clapping theirhands and they're cheering just for me.     "Hey fagboy, I'm talking to you!"     I just keep walking, with my eyes to the ground.  He's just mouthing offtonight.  I get in my car and drive away.     I drive around for a while.  I don't feel like going home.  Not yet.  Idrive back and forth through town, music blaring.  I eventually pull over andjust sit around and check out what's happening.  Then I see her.  This Week'sInfatuation.  She's walking down the road, right towards me.  I can't helpstaring, but she's perfect.  She stops right in front of my car.  I get out andgo over to her.     "Oh, I need you so much!", she moans.  "Please let me be your fuck-slavefor life!!"     Someone grabs my hair and nearly yanks me out through the window of mycar.     "What the fuck are you staring at, faggot?"     Oh shit, it's the chick's boyfriend -- a football player.  He puts me in aheadlock.  I'm hanging out my car window, I can't move.  His girlfriend comesover to us and laughs in my face.  After a good minute, he lets go and shovesme back in my car.  He stands in front of my car for awhile, taunting me to runhim over.  I just sit there and do nothing.  He's beaten me, physically andpsychologically.  And he knows it.     I drive home.  I've had a terrible night.  I go straight to my room andlock the door.  I reach under the pillow and pull out my old friend.  My onlytrue friend.  He doesn't do anything.  He just waits patiently for that secondof truth.     "Well, old friend, it's time".  He already knows it.  I put the barrel inmy mouth and pull the trigger.  I wish I could wake up from this one. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_                                "Smiling Faces"     I just read something that really bugs me.  Here's an excerpt.  It'scalled "5-11-85" by Henry Rollins, from POLIO FLESH, page 34.          "I have learned to question smiling faces.  I don't trust      smiling faces anymore.  When someone smiles and reaches out      to shake my hand, I try to guess what they want from me and      when they will try to sink the knife in....  When someone      gives away something, they want something in return, somehow,      someway.  This is a game that gets played on many levels.      Don't take candy from strangers unless you're willing to      take a ride in the car."     I give my writing to lots of people.  Do I expect something in return? The more I think about it, the more I realize I do.  I expect complements,friendship, and constructive criticism.  I expect people to tell me I'm a greatwriter and that I'm real cool.  I expect people to print my stuff and help meachieve fame and fortune.  I expect it.  And shit, when I got the chance totalk to Henry for a few minutes at the Providence gig, I was one of thosesmiling faces, shaking his hand a couple of times, telling him about all thefree goodies I just mailed him.     I don't know if this is what he had in mind when he wrote it, and I don'tknow if there is anything wrong in wanting recognition and attention - it'sonly human.  But still, I feel kinda funny right now, I feel low. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_                                "Chance Meeting"             We collide             By accident (Fate is cruel).             I ....                       .... Never thought I'd see you again.             We both say "Hi"             And talk but don't say anything.             Each aware of the other's uneasiness.             I feel ....                           .... Out of place.             I feel soft.             My teeth feel like styrofoam -             My eyes are marshmallows.             I want to melt away ....             We eventually part, each             Relieved we've survived             Another chance meeting. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_                           "Things I Wanted to Smash"     I saw a car that had a stuffed cat with glass eyes in the rear window. Every time the right directional was used, the cat's right eye blinked inunison with the tailight, same with the left side.  I wanted to smash it.     I saw this little boy eating an ice cream cone with his dad.  Sortareminded me of when I was a kid.  I wanted to smash that ice cream cone rightin his face. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_                                    "Corpse"     When I walked through the door, I wasn't surprised, or shocked even.  Idon't know why, I just wasn't.  You were standing there, in the doorway to thekitchen.  Just standing there, head in the clouds, walking on air.  Juststa...... hanging there, eyes rolled towards Heaven.  I noticed you didn't usea rope.  You used the extension cord from your computer.  What a fuckingcomputer whiz geek you were.  You were always flapping about how computers weregoing to kill off all of mankind someday.  Well, they got you.  What irony. What a shame.     I let you hang around for a while.  I don't know why, I just don't feellike cutting you down right now.  What an asshole you are.  We were supposed togo to ZZ Top.  I've got front row seats and you were supposed to drive.  How amI gonna go now?  Fuck man, we're still going.  I don't care what you say, we'regoing to see ZZ Top and you're driving.     I eventually cut you down.  I don't know what to do with you, so I justslide you underneath my bed.     I had trouble sleeping that night.  Remember how, when we were kids, weused to be scared of monsters under our beds?  Well it's like being a kid againwith you under there.  I had to keep hanging over the edge of my bed andpeeking under to make sure you hadn't moved.     The next morning I slid you out from underneath.  "Want some breakfast?",I asked, then laughed out loud.  I kept poking you, and waiting for you tomove, but you didn't.  Any second now, you'll get up and we'll start wrestlingor bashing each other over the head with empty 2-liter plastic soda bottles,like we always used to.  You never did move, though.     As the days passed, I started to have lots of fun playing with you.  Idon't mean anything queer, I just mean playing with you.  I use you as afoot-stool.  I prop you up in a chair with a lit cigarette and a book.  I writeall over you with a thick magic marker.  I draw a beard and mustache on you,put a Manson "X" on your forehead, and draw anarchy symbols all over your body.Shit, I've never had this much fun in my life!  Every kid should have a reallive corpse to play with!     The fun lasted for about a week.  That's when your stupid bitch girlfriendshowed up.  She wanted to know where you were.  She was crying.  I said Ididn't know, trying my hardest to keep a straight face.  I started laughing. That pissed her off and she slapped me and started screaming something at me, Ican't remember what it was.  I don't blame her for freaking out, I'd be pissedif I were in her shoes.  I wanted to scream back at her so bad.  "You'll nevertake him away from me again!"  I kept my mouth shut, though.  Relax, man.  I'vegot the last laugh.  I hold all the trump cards.  Your girlfriend was alwayssplitting us up.  We were best friends for life, we did everything together. Until she came along.  Well, this time she stays home all alone.  It's you andme both, and she's out in the cold.  Your girlfriend left on a flood of tears,and was back in an hour with the police.     My lawyer says I've got nothing to worry about.  The autopsy will provethat I had absolutely nothing to do with your death.  They're just going tolock me away for about a week for some counseling and whatever.  They said thatI couldn't cope with your death and I went temporarily insane.  Whatever.  Ijust hope they let me out soon, I can't wait to go dig up your grave and playwith you some more ..... _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_                                   "Tattoos"     Hey Rollins, you think your tattoos are cool?  Check out this kid I usedto work with.  He's got both his arms covered, back and front, with Supermanand the Flash.  And he's got the Super Friends on his chest.  No shit.  I swearon my 3 inch cock that I ain't shitting you!!!  I bet you can't say that you'vegot the Super Friends on your chest, can ya, Henry? .... No, I didn't think so. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_                                    "My Car"     My car is an extension of my penis.     I love my cock very much.  It's a 1978 Chevette.  Yeah, true, my cock issmall, but it gets great mileage.  I beat on my cock very hard, and frequentlytoo, but I also take good care of it and replace any worn out parts.  I getvery angry when people sit on my cock, or lean against it, because you mightscratch it.  I bet if I showed you my cock, you'd like it very much, too. _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_ _/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_     Check out Dean's story "Shitbum" in the comic "Ashes" #2 from CaliberPress.
