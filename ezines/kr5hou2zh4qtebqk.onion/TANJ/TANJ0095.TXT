                           - 01: Loose Ends -
                              by Ironhorse



 A light coating of dust lies atop everything in the small two bedroom
house in Duart, Onterio. The home has been locked up and abandoned for two
months, the last person inside, Lois Thompson, a real estate agent.

 Often, when a house such as this remains un-owned for so long, the
windows get broken and children vandalize the yard. But this has not
happened here. This house is haunted.

 "Fifty dollars if I just stay inside the old Sanders' house for one
night?"

 "You'll never do it," boasted one of four children outside the
fore-mentioned home.

 "But you said Miss Sanders was a nice lady, if she was so nice, why would
her ghost want to hurt anyone?"

 The boy being dared is eleven year old Joey Russo, new to the town and
ready to prove himself in front of the town bully and his two friends.

 "It's not who she was that made her bad, it's how she died," boasted the
bully.

 "Yeah, it was gross!"

 "How was it then?"

 "You ever hear of the super-hero team World League?"

 "Duh... like who hasn't?"

 "Well lady Sanders went to California to work with them as a cleaning
woman and she fell in love with Great White..."

 "That's stupid," quipped Russo, "If they were in love how come I never
heard about it?"

 "Because..." the bully said with an eerie pause, "Great White didn't
love _her_."

 "No way."

 "Yes. Anyway, Sanders was working, all the time trying to get him to
notice her but he wouldn't even give her the time of day. Then came the big
fight up on Hollywood hills... It seems World League got the hell beat out
of them and right before they were about to lose to Evolutionary
Force, Miss Sanders ran into the clearing in an attempt to save Great
White's life and had her spinal cord severed by Mane."

 "That's how she died?"

 "No. She was just paralyzed and bleeding to death. But her diversion was
long enough for Great White to regain consciousness and realize how bad off
they were."

 "What happened?"

 "Great White. He went super-nova, burned up the entire top of the
mountain. Almost all of World League survived."

 "Almost?"

 "Yeah. Flex just atomized. And Great White couldn't handle that much
output. He killed himself to save the others."

 "Evolutionary Force?"

 "All dead. Everyone except for Mane."

 "What happened to him?"

 "No one knows... But they did find his style wounds on Miss Sanders' body.
It looked like he tortured and raped her before she died."

 "No way," exclaimed Russo with a curative glance at the house."

 "Yes. Ask anyone, they'll tell you the same thing. So, do we have a bet?"

 "I don't know..."

 "I knew you were chicken..." The bully's friends joined in with this
to tease Joey, and to see if he was actually brave enough to do what they
would never do.

 "Okay," Joey said after a few minutes, "but only 'til sun-up."

 "Deal."

 Minutes later Joey Russo went home to lie to his father that he'd be
staying over a friend's house for the night. It would be the easiest fifty
bucks he ever made. There wasn't no such things as ghosts anyway... was
there?


                               --+=*=+--


 It's so great to see you again," said the feather-laden Alice
Stevenson, previously known as Condor. Those who she welcomes to her San
Fransico home are the Spinskis - Adrov, Lori, and their one month old
daughter Jennifer Love.

 "Joe! How you doing?" Ask the one-time Frost [Lori] of Joe Develio once she
was freed from Alice's hug.

 "Good, I've got a record company looking at the band - you should see
the light show I put on at our concerts..."

 "Your concerts? I thought it was Mike who started the band," Adrov
interrupted.

 With that a gust of wind passed the four at the door and suddenly before
them stood Mike Johnson, previously known as Bolt.

 "I was. Am. This hose asked if he could cut in on the action," Mike said
with a smile at Joe, "I decided, why not? A little electrical manipulation
sure as hell could put on quite a show."

 They laughed, exchanged more greetings and then went into the dining
room.

 "Really though," Mike spoke on to Adrov over the appetizers, "I
don't see why they've denied me Guiness Book, I mean I play a hell of a
lot faster bass then Joey DeMaio, so what if I'm super-human?"

 Laughter.

 "Joey DeMaio," who's he with again?" asks Develio.

 "Manowar."

 "Brotherhood of America?" asks Lori.

 "No, the band," replies Johnson.

 "Oh. Whatever happened to the Brotherhood of America anyway?"


                               --+=*=+--


 "Isn't it great honey? Only here two weeks and Joey's already got
friends."

 "I don't like it," replied Mr. Russo. "What do we know about these kids?
How do we know he'll be okay?"

 "Calm down dear, how's he supposed to make friends?"

 As his mother finished speaking, little Joey Russo entered the room.

 "So dad, can I?"

 "Well, I suppose - but only 'til tomorrow afternoon, you still have work
to do here..."

 "Thanks dad!" With a smile and a hug, Joey was gone...



                               --+=*=+--


 Very much elsewhere...

 "Hey baby, wanna see what a real man can do for you?" taunts a rather
large man as Angel Smith and her less endowed male friend made their was
past the alley in which he stood.

 "Ignore him Thomas, please," Angel said not-so under her breath.

 "What was that?" spoke the man, stepping from the alley, placing his
formidable hand on her shoulder and forcibly spinning her to face him.

 "Hey!" Thomas yelled but was literally cut short as the brute produced
a six inch blade and stabbed him in the stomach, ripping the lining,
allowing the acids to eat Thomas' insides and bringing upon a slow,
agonizing death.

 Angel screamed as he withdrew the blade, dropping Thomas in the street
to die, and throwing her down into the alley.

 "Wh-who are you?" she stammered as he pushed her to the trash-strewn
pavement while holding onto her blouse, ripping it from her body.

 "My friends call me Stark..."



                               --+=*=+--


 Well, I guess this is really it, Joey Russo thought to himself. as he
stood at the open gate of the picket fence that surrounds the late
Jennifer Sanders house. To enhance the scene even more so, the front of the
house stood in shadows, the house silhouetted against the setting
western sun.

 It's okay... he thought walking slowly towards the front door, there's
no such thing as ghosts. Just then he thought he saw a flash of
yellow-white light in the bedroom window.

 "You're crazy," he said to himself as he opened the door and stepped
inside.

 "He's a goner," said one of the bully's followers many minutes after Russo
shut the door behind him.

 "Sh-shut up man," the bully said.

 They stood transfixed and watched the house until the last light was
gone from day and it could be seen no more. And then they stared a little
more, and finally went home.



                               --+=*=+--


 "...all my mana and fireball you for twenty-three points of damage.
You're dead."

 "Som' bitch," Adrov Spinski said standing from the table at which we
was just defeated by Mike Johnson in a game of Magic: The Gathering.

 "Good game," said Mike. "Let's see what I won..."

 Turning over two carding in the center of the table, Johnson smiled.

 "My Rock Hydra!" exclaimed the Russian. "Rematch!"

 As the men played their games and Joe Develio did the dishes, the women
sat in the living room discussing goings-on.

 "...really?" asked Alice Stevenson, "All night?"

 Lori Olsen-Spinski laughed and replied, "You should have seen him while
he was still immortal."



                               --+=*=+--


 Stark rose and looked over what he had done. Beneath him, raped, killed,
and then raped again, lies the body of Angel Smith, once as beautiful as her
namesake, now a bloody-violated mess. An evilly satisfied smile crept over
his face.

 In a final act of ruthless defiance he urinated on herlifeless form.

 When fully satisfied he turned and disappeared down the alley from
whence he came.



                               --+=*=+--


 Later the three visitors to Mrs. Stevenson's depart, and on the way to
the car Mike Johnson approaches one last order of business before the
Spinski's leave.

 Pulling Adrov to one side he asks, "Seriously Andy, have you heard from
the Brotherhood lately?"

 "What is it with you Mike?"

 "Stallion. I want her. _Bad_."

 The Russian laughs. "Good luck... Actually, I haven't heard from either
Brotherhood in quite a while... do they still exist?"



                               --+=*=+--


 Joey Russo spent the first hour inside the late Sanders residence
within the living room - he dared not go any further.

 Right here, he thought to himself. All I have to do is stay right in this
room until the sun comes up and I can buy that new Sega cartridge I want.
Right in this room.

 But, much to the protests of his eleven year old rationale, he found
himself moving towards the bedroom he thought he saw the light in before.

 What am I doing? He asked himself as one very shaky hand grasped the
doorknob of the suspect room.

 Just do it.

 He turned the knob and flung the door open as fast as he could, trying to
steel himself and be prepared for anything he saw.

 He wasn't.



 ... to be continued.
