                  - Little Jimmy Barnes: Adventures by Night -
                                By Lars Rindsig

In 1960, little Jimmy Barnes was eight years old. He lived in Reafville, a
small town outside Flint, Michigan, with his parents and the family dog, a
chubby, old St. Bernard that was named Stick which was little Jimmy's first
word, which he spoke while hugging the dog grinningly and sucking on its
tail.


The little family was a quite happy one; Jimmy's father, a tall and thin man,
who loved his wife and child and would do anything to protect them from
getting hurt in any way, worked as an accountant at the local carplant and
his mother who was called Doris stayed at home, taking care of the house -
and Stick - and preparing lunch for Jimmy when he came home from school.


Jimmy did not care much for school - it bored him, but most days he went,
except when he and two of his best friends, Frank and Grant, went 'trekking'
into the nearby woods. They would chase small animals, squirrels and such,
and when they got tired of this they would go to Mr. Petersen's ice cream
stand, where they would buy a milk shake or a Coke. Sometimes the boys would
catch the early shows in the town's theatre, at that hour there was seldom
many other visitors in the cinema, and Jimmy and his friends had the place
pretty much to themselves and they could make as much noise as they required
to enjoy the movie properly.


One day in May as Jimmy came home from school (in Mrs. Harvey's class they
had dissected frogs. Jimmy found this to be as much fun as he had ever had
in school) he found a note from his mother which said that she had gone to
the Ness' house for an hour or two. "You know where to find the milk and
cookies.", the note said and Jimmy did. He entered the kitchen and found no
less than three cookie jars which he brought into the living room where he
placed himself in front of the television set. Besides the Barnes' only two
other families in the street had a TV and Jimmy was the object of the envy
of many. He felt good as he switched the set on to watch the Stephen Heller
Show, which was a show that was broadcast from Michigan's own TV-station. He
sat cross-legged in front of the television, hands deeply buried in his
mother's cookie jars and his eyes closely following Stephen Heller's every
move and listening to Heller's comments to his guests. It was not always
Jimmy understood the joke but the studio audience laughed and Jimmy supposed
that it was funny then and laughed with them.


Suddenly he heard a thump behind him, he quickly took his hand out of the
cookie jar, afraid that it was his moher who had come home and surprised
 him red-handed, eating her cookies and watching TV without his father's
permission. Slowly he looked around the room only to see Stick in the door
jogging towards him. "Oh, it's only you. Gee, Stick, you really scared me
there. Good old Stick," Jimmy said and walked over to the large animal and
took the tip of its tail in his mouth - a habit he had had since he was a
baby. With the tail in his mouth he mumbled "Stick," and threw his arms
around Stick's belly. But Stick wanted otherwise. With his nose he directed
Jimmy towards the garden door. "What's up, Stick. Is there something you
want to show me? Or do you want to play?" Stick slowly walked over to the
garden door and patiently waited for Jimmy to put on his shoes and then open
the door for the both of them to go out in the garden.


It was hot and Stick made Jimmy follow him into the shade of the hedge.
Around the Barnes-family's garden there was a large hedge, which was planted
there in the 1930's by a previous owner. Jimmy's father trimmed it and so the
edges were straight and the hedge was all in all quite nice to look at. But
thirty years of children and animals playing had given the hedge a large
number of small caves and hideouts from cats and parents. It was one of
these caves that Stick made Jimmy enter. It was a quite large cave. It was
almost as high as the hedge was tall and almost as wide as the hedge too. It
was large enough for a grown man, an eight-year old boy and a large St.
Bernard to fit in there without any problems. And they did.


In the far end of the cave sat a man. He wore a business suit and a hat. As
he noticed Stick and Jimmy enter he smiled at them and put out his
cigarette. "Hello, Jimmy," the man said. "Y-y-you know my name?" Jimmy asked.
He was startled. "Who are are you ... and-and ... what are you doing in our
hedge ... and ... who are you ...?" The man discontinued Jimmy's stuttering
with a movement of his hand and a smile towards Jimmy who now suddenly felt
very calm and secure with the man. The man continued to smile as he said "I
know you now no longer have any interest in who I am but I'll tell you
anyway." He winked one eye at Jimmy who now truly did not care who the man
was and what he did in the hedge. The man continued "You don't know me and
yet you do." The man smiled broader, grinning at his little play of words.
"You see, I am what's inside you and your pa and your mommy too, Mrs. Harvey
and principal Black. I'm what's inside everybody. I'm their anger and guilt.
Sometimes I have to take action and I need some one to help me. 'coz there
are some things I can't do myself. Can you understand that, Jimmy? You know,
old Stick here already helped me by bringing you out here. I'm sure Stick
would've helped me with what I have to do but I'm afraid he can't. But you
can and Stick will assist you. Will you help me, Jimmy?"


"Sure," Jimmy said, smiling a little insecure at first but then, after
looking the man in his eyes and seeing his kind smile, it turned into a
merry grin all over Jimmy's face.



                                      oOo



A little while after Jimmy came out from under the hedge. Stick followed him
as usual and he poked Jimmy with his nose as they walked towards the house.
Fortunately, Jimmy's mother had not returned from Mrs. Ness' yet and Jimmy
quickly put the cookies in the cupboard where he got them and did not turn
on the TV-set. Instead he went into his room where he began to sort his
baseball cards. He had a lot. More than two hundred. His father had given
him a lot of cards and even brought him to Flint to see a major league
baseball match and he had promised Jimmy that he would give him all of his
cards for Jimmy's ten-year birthday. The father had almost four hundred cards
in a box in the attic and Jimmy knew that he would never get any of the
father's cards. But he had promised to help the nice man and he felt that it
was more important to carry out his task than get the father's old baseball
cards.


When he had finished sorting the cards Jimmy went out in the kitchen and
found a lambchop on which he fed Stick. A little while later his mother came
home and made him a glass of warm milk. Besides stealing the meat for Stick
he did nothing unusual for the rest of the day. At nine he went to bed.


He lied in his bed for half an hour and then - without a noise - he got up.
Still in his pyjamas he opened the door and went into the dark hallway and
into the kitchen, making sure his parents did not hear him from the living
room where they were watching The Fugitive. In the kitchen Stick was
waiting. "Good boy," Jimmy whispered in his ear and sucked quickly on the
dog's tail. Then Jimmy rose and got a large and sharp knife from the drawer
where his mother kept the cutlery. It was the same knife his mother used
when she cut large humps of meat or the like. Knife in hand and Stick by his
side Jimmy walked - as silent as possible - towards the living room.


In the door he stopped and contemplated his parents. His mother was half
asleep, resting her head on Jimmy's father's shoulders as he carefully
watched the TV where Jimmy saw the one- armed man escaping through a window.
"Now, Stick!" Jimmy said silently and Stick leaped with an unknown force
onto the couch where its jaws closed around Jimmy's mother's neck. She
screamed terrified as she woke up from her doze and Jimmy ran to his father
and with a growl far too deep to be of his own voice he slashed his father's
throat. The blood sprinkled from the father and most of it hit Jimmy who held
his mouth open, trying to swallow as much as possible as he drove the
knife's large blade in between two of the father's ribs.


After drawing the knife out, with an enormous strength he smashed the
father's left rib cage and then turned to his mother who already lay
lifeless, her neck broken by Stick's strong bite. Jimmy laid his mother on
the floor and with the knife, which had begun to feel good in his hands by
now, he cut up her face, parted it the best he could and then broke her ribs
too by jumping down on them from the couch. It was hard work and Jimmy had
begun to sweat but he did not mind it and continued his deed.


He took of the father's shirt and turned him so he lied face down. Jimmy
then began to cut a pattern without really knowing why or what he was
carving into his father's back. When he had finished he saw that it was a
pentagram and in the middle there was an eclipse with a straight line
through. Even though Jimmy had never encoutered this sign - or for that
matter a pentagram - he instantly knew what it was. He smeared the blood of
his parents on all parts of his body that were not covered by his pyjamas
and then went into the garage where he got several cans of gasoline. They
were heavy to carry but it was well worth the burden, Jimmy knew. He poured
gasoline all over the house. As he finished he got a box of matches from the
kitchen. He had seldom been trusted with lighting matches in the past but he
was now his own master. He went to a room in the other end of the house and
there struck a match, setting the house on fire.


Without any rush he went back into the living room where he took Stick by
the collar and led him trough the sign on his father's back, following Stick
closely was Jimmy himself....
