First off, I'd like to say that I'm not dead. But Allah knows I'm damn'd
tired! Between getting married back on May 14th, shopping for the baby-to-
come, and shopping for a house to live in, I've had a busy summer. My
"staff" has seen some additions, losses, and changes, but I imagine we'll
be going strong for quite awhile yet!

Written By       : Tal Meta
Date Released    : 01-17-93

I actually wrote this story several years ago on a grimy Amstrad PCW. Most
all of what is portrayed in this story actually happened during an AD&D
campaign I played in while I was in the Air Force.

This file was compiled over the course of several weeks by as many as
half a dozen authors. For anyone who cares, Ned Copper greatly resembles
a certain editor-in-chief....

Description      : Going Crazy In The Suburbs 06: Changing Values
Written By       : Hairy Leech
Date Released    : 01-25-93

This file pretty much marked the end, I think, of Hairy's writing much of
anything. He's said, on and off, that he'd written things he wanted me
to have, but he never seems to get them to me. Which is a shame, as his
life has changed so much in the year + since he wrote this. I, for one
would like to see how much affect its had on his style.

I kinda liked this one, as it gave me an excellent vent for my own personal
distaste for religion in general and Christianity in particular.

Description      : Blood Lust 03: The Marriage
Written By       : Anonymous Bosch
Date Released    : 03-11-93

Anonymous was very, very happy to get this file written, as he'd wanted to
kill his main character off since chapter two. Having pretty much depleted
his interest in them, but had promised a trilogy. So he turned the premise
sideways, wrote it from a female perspective, and grossed out a whole other
side of the BBS community....

Description      : Offramp To Hell
Written By       : Tal Meta
Date Released    : 03-22-93

This file owed its birth to a guy calling himself Puppet Master. He submitted
a file that wasn't quite what I look for in a TANJ, so I suggested some
"improvements". He never resubmitted, so I wrote the file myself.

I remember that much. :)

Written By       : Tal Meta
Date Released    : 05-26-93

Long, long ago I threatened to write a "retrospective" about a certain
relationship. The person in question responded by assuming that every TANJ
file ever written was full of "malicious lies" about her. Well, she can be
certain of one thing at least... TANJ.069 was MOST DEFINITELY written about
her! I hope she's happy now. <heg>

general BBS scene after writing this.

Date Released    : 08-25-93

Little did I know when I wrote this file that the person it was about
would come gliding back into my life a few DAYS later. I made damned sure
she got a piece of _MY_ wedding cake. We're good friends now... since its
all we can be.

Description      : Blood Lust 2´ -Stalking Buffy
Written By       : Anonymous Bosch
Date Released    : 08-31-93

Anonymous sent me this for my birthday... I had been moderating ChateauNet's
VAMPIRE echomail conference, and some female calling herself Buffy the
Vampire Slayer had been making a royal mess of the echo. So Anonymous
(ever the lurking reader) wrote this little tfile to show her just how
annoying _HE_ could be.

Written By       : Metonymous Bosch
Date Released    : 11-18-93

I never, ever suspected that anyone besides Anonymous would want to write
"BloodLust" stories. So imagine my suprise when his SISTER chimed in with
a submission!

Somehow, I imagine their formative years as something straight out of
_The Addams Family_....

Written By       : The Ac908/Ac215 Poets Society
Date Released    : 11-22-93

This poetry file includes Angelique's first "official" contribution to
TANJ. Her poetry was featured in TANJ's first poetry issue, but that
was done entirely without her knowlege. (and yes, she has since read the
file)

Ace's first contribution to TANJ was 1993's only "Holidays" file, marking a
change from last season's "killer christmas" motif.

Description      : To Sleep, Perchance To Dream...
Written By       : Tal Meta
Date Released    : 01-10-94

This file is actually about six months worth of collected dream fragments,
blended together to make some kind of sense. I may or may not be releasing
a sequel to this one... I'm not sure if Tom Hanks committing suicide in my
driveway belongs here or in a "BloodLust" file, though.

Written By       : Public Enemy #3
Date Released    : 01-30-94

This file, written by Ace's 14 year old son, is amusing if only because
several weeks before he submitted it he threatened to have me arrested and
prosecuted for having published the "BloodLust" series of Tfiles. Threats
like this amuse me greatly, especially when I quote the First Amendment back
at the threateners....

This file came to me one afternoon.... the first draft was too obviously
a joke, so I "serioused" it up enough to be convincing. Since its release,
I've gotten consolation messages, confused messages, and people calling
me Derf for not having warned them it was all a lie.

Heh!

I'm really looking forward to his next submission (hint, hint).

This file is not available in Australia, due to thier curious customs
concerning libel & defamation of character. :) This also marked the first
of what is sure to be numerous submissions from Down Under.

I found out after the fact that this file should have had a different title,
but what the hell... the one I gave it works well enough, I think. Written
to be "compatable" with the BloodLust(tm) files, it actually is far less gory.

This one really should be read to music. Pick something soft, melodic, and
preferably nostalgic. I won't mention what song I had playing, as that
particular 70's duo hardly matches my "image". <g>

An interesting tale of mismanagement in Saudi Arabia.

I've been there. Having seen the way those people drive, I found this file
to be frighteningly reminiscent. Radio techs based here in the US assure me
that this sort of nonsense happens here, too.

This file reminds me of BloodLust(tm) more than anything anyone else has
written. Even though nobody has a knife, or even sheds any blood, it
makes me think of things written to make people FEEL. Something, somewhere
in this story is certain to give someone nausea....

Which is why I liked it. :)
