                                  Adrian Blood
                                                                              
  "NO!!!!"                                                                    

  The word rang out in the middle of the night, throughout the halls, and
resounding all through the manor.                                             

  He awoke in a cold sweat. The same dream. Again.

  That same vision of her death. Rage, loss, longing, sadness, depression....
all these emotions ran through him at once.                                   

  The pain built until it finally climaxed in that one defiant word...
a shouted denial of what was, and a voicing of all hopes, fears, and          
frustration to whatever power might be listening.                             

  Yet the fact remained, she was dead. And he had been powerless to stop
it, forced to watch as she had been systematically slaughtered.               

  It had been 2 years ago as of tomorrow, and he had yet to find her
murderers. They had escaped his blade, and after a few months with no trace,  
he had given up all hope of ever avenging her.                                

  "Lord Kenneth?"

  A soft voice intruded upon his silent misery.

  He looked up and saw before him Alena, one of his fellow knights. He
quickly composed himself.                                                     

  "Yes Alena? What is it?"

  Alena was beautiful.

  There was simply no other word for her. Her figure was the envy of many
woman, but it was her face that caught and held a man's attention.            

  Her skin was as soft as a doe and her deep blue eyes seemed to gaze into
men's souls. Her long red tressess were well kept and as smooth as silk. Her  
face was one of the most pleasant to gaze upon, it held a beauty and grace    
that rivaled the prettiest of the elven princesses, though she was human.     
Looking upon that stunning visage, it was readily apparent that she was a     
kind, gentle soul... yet a gleam in her eyes told of a love of independance,  
and those that riled her anger found her a fierce opponent indeed.            

  She had joined the Knights of Solamnia late in her life,  in her 30's,
having been introduced to their ranks by Lord Kenneth. But she had found their
ideals and tenets to match her own, and had quickly risen through the ranks.  

  "I heard your shout, I thought you might need someone to talk too."

  Lord Kenneth was a young man in body, but he had aged far faster due to the
many tragedies in his life. He had been the second youngest man to ever attain  
membership in the Order of the Rose. He was but 23 now, and had gained        
membership when he turned 21, shortly before she had died..... he had worked  
his way up through the Orders of Crown and Sword, his daring and bravery well 
known in his home lands. It isnt often that an 18 year old cleans out a manor 
of its undead inhabitants... the very manor he now lived in.                  

  The quests had been hard, but he had had nothing else. His parents killed
by plague when he was young, his brother turned to a life of crime. His life  
had brightened when he had met Shannon. She was to him the rising sun after a 
dark and horrible night. They had loved each other deeply. Words hadn't been a  
necessity, they had always seemed to know what was on the others mind. No one 
else had been able to read him so well... He and Shannon both knew that they
had been meant for each other..... but, abruptly, and without warning, the
light in his life had been snuffed out...                                       


                                     .o0o.


  ...And the sun had never risen for him again.

  Despite all that, he had gone on. He stubbornly clung to his ideals, and
his honor... his sense of justice and right. It had made him cynical and      
bitter, but he went on. He had to live... if for no other reason then to see  
her murderers on their way to the Abyss.                                      

  "Nothing Alena. I'm fine. Just a bad dream." He didn't think she would buy
it. Alena wasn't easy to fool.

  She didn't. "Talk to me Kenneth. Im your friend, there's no need for you to
be terse with me. You were dreaming of her again, weren't you?"               

  "Yes." he answered, the images of the dream again filling his minds eye. He
shut his eys tightly and held back the emotional maelstrom. He hated involving  
others in his problems.                                                       

  Alena gazed upon him, sadness and frustration filling her. She was
powerless to do anything for her friend. The ghosts of his past haunted and   
tortured him.                                                                 

  She sat down beside him, and hugged him, comforting him as best she could.
He couldnt hold it back any longer.                                           

  "Why? Why her?" he sobbed. And once again, all was contained in that one
word. Why.... an entreatment as well as a demand to the gods...... Alena
briefly wondered how they would answer.                                       

  "I don't know Kenneth. I just don't know. But you need to get a grip.
Stop living in the past and get on with your life."                           

  Weariness and grief rimmed his now drying eyes. "I know. But its not
easy.... not while her murderers are still on  the lose. By Paladine, I would 
do anything to bring them to justice. I never even got to say goodbye, Alena."

  He had not told her the details of her death, but she knew they must have
been terrible indeed. How does he bare it all? Alena wondered. What drives    
him to go on? The question was futile though. She already knew the answer. It 
was revenge that drove him. The want and the need to find those who had slain 
his love, and give them the ending they deserved. Revenge, however, can be a  
very deadly desire. She hoped Kenneth wouldnt make any foolish mistakes...... 

  She looked down, and saw that he was asleep in her arms. He looked at
peace, comfortable. She held him all through the night, leaving him only in   
the morning.                                                                  


                                     .o0o.


  The morning failed to brighten Kenneth's mood, and he was still brooding.
All who knew him, and knew what he was like when he got like this, avoided    
him. Those that didn't, well..... they had a learning experience.             
The evening came, and found Kenneth sequestered in his study. He sat,         
remembering happy times, thinking of all the quiet moments that he and Shannon  
had spent here, when they both had wanted to get away from the hustle and     
bustle of humanity.                                                           

  He slammed his fist down upon the oaken desk. The anger building again.....

  "You miss her, don't you?"

  Kenneth whirled around, drawing the dagger he always kept at his belt.

  Behind him stood the one who had spoken.

  The mans eyes held a hint of amusement, as well as threat. His hair was
dark, of the deepest black... as were the robes he wore.                      

  "Leave me wizard, I have no need of the foul servants of Takhisis!"

  "Ah, but you might at that... but come now, you have yet to answer my
question."                                                                    

  Kenneth's patience grew short........

  "You have one last warning. Leave now or I will kill you."

  "Will you now? I thought you were the kind lord, the one who gave all to
his subjects.. the one that would not deny them an audience. I see I was      
mistaken. Good day."                                                          

  Is the magister intentionally pushing my buttons? Kenneth wondered.

  "Very well. Have a seat." he gestured towards one of the chairs in front of
him. "You shall have your audience."                                          

  "My lord is most gracious." the mage answered with a sneer. "Again, I ask,
you miss her dont you?"                                                       

  Kenneth let his gaze fall on the portrait behind and above the mage.

  "Yes, I do."

  "And what would you say if I told you that you can have her murderers heads
on pikes as early as tomorrow night?"                                         

  This got Kenneths attention.

  "Say on." he commanded.

  "I know the identities of the ones who slew her, and I know where they
will meet."                                                                   

  "And what do you want for this information?" Kenneth asked through clenched
teeth.                                                                        

  "Nothing. I will tell you freely. Your love was a sacrifice to Chemosh,
lord of the dead. She was slain by priests of that foul deity. Once every 25  
months or so, the moons are in a configuration of power. On that night, the   
followers of Chemosh sacrifice someone and increase the power of their lord.  
That configuration will happen again two nights from now. They will meet at   
the same place that your love was slain. It is a place of power, and is       
perfect for their needs."                                                     

  Kenneth absorbed all of this, thinking, planning. One nagging question
remained.                                                                     

  "Why do you do this? Why would a servant of evil Takhisis help me, a
servant of Lord Paladine?"                                                    

  The man laughed. "Certainly not for love of you or your god. My reasons are
my own. Do not ask again. Stop them and I will consider it payment enough for 
the information. Farewell."                                                   

  And just like that, he was gone, as if hed never been.

  Kenneth stared a bit longer at Shannon's portrait. Then he stood up, left
the room, and began to prepare.                                               


                                     .o0o.


  Alena knew something was up. For the past two days, Lord Kenneth had been
buoyant, happy, and intense. Most of the manors inhabitants were ecstatic with
the change in their lord, thinking that he had finally gotten over his lost   
love. Alena did not believe that was the case..... with the anniversary of    
his loves death so near, he should have been hell to live with.               

  On the eve of the anniversary, she got her answer. It had been purely by
chance that she was in the stables that night, but she had been hidden        
from his view when Kenneth entered. He was armed in full battle array, which  
was even more curious.. it was the armor he had forsworn, the armor he had    
worn the night she had died.                                                  

  Alena decided then and there to follow him and see what he was up too.


                                     .o0o.


  His spirit had been lifted the past few days, knowing that the time for
vengenance was near. And now the night had arrived. He had taken his armor    
out of storage, and donned it. It seemed only appropriate that it be worn on  
this night....                                                                

  He had slipped quietly out to the stables, content no one had seen him. He
quickly readied his favorite charger and quickly left. He never saw the shadow
that was Alena following him.                                                 

  He arrived at the grove that hid the evil ritual site, memory once again
flooding over him. He had apparently arrived early, for no one was to be seen.

  He sat back and waited.

  It wasn't long. Perhaps 15 minutes before the evil priests entered
the grove. And with them, was a young girl, about the same age Shannon had    
been.                                                                         

  "Lord Paladine, grant me the strength to save this young child, and to
avenge my lost love. Grant me the power to utterly destroy them."             

  Nothing happended.

  Kenneth knew at once what it was.... Paladine had turned from him. Revenge
did indeed have its costs....                                                 

  "So be it." he whispered with the faintest tinge of regret. He was alone in
this, even the heavens has abandoned him.                                     

  He readied himself for his attack.


                                     .o0o.


  The priests had gone through the openings of the ritual, and were now ready
to begin the sacrifice in earnest.. a sacrifice that would last many hours,   
while they enjoyed the pain of the victim.....                                

  Now was the time to strike, when their concentration was focused on the
task at hand. He leapt from his hiding place, decimating 5 of the 15 priests. 

  The other 10 priests quickly surronded him...... the battle became fierce,
as the priests fought for their very lives, while Kenneth fought with a rage  
born of desperation and grief.                                                

  5 more of the priests fell before Kenneth's vengeful blade. The final five
backed off, to plan their strategy.... Kenneth did not relent. He engaged the 
nearest priest, and fought him, finally ending his life, decaptating him. The 
last of the priests had apparently decided the best way to destroy this insane
man was too attack him wolfpack style. They surronded him, so that one was    
always at his back. Desperately, Kenneth sought a way out of the trap, knowing
he was dead if he did not do so. Frantically, and with more power then he had 
thought himself capable, he cut downward at the nearest priest. The priest    
formed a perfect parry, which by all rights should have stopped the blow...   
had it not cut through the blocking blade and into the mans face. Kenneth     
would always remember the look of surprise on that ones face with grim    
satisfaction.                                                                 

  The others had not recovered from the shock of the kill yet, and another
fell before the steel of righteousness. The final two decided they had enough,  
and fled....                                                                  

  Only one of them made it.

  Briefly Kenneth debated following the final of the circle into the forest.
He decided that freeing the girl was more important right now... there was    
always time for a hunt.                                                       

  Never had a more fatal mistake been made..... the final priest saw Kenneth
turn his back as he reached the forest edge. He pulled a hidden dagger from   
inside his robes, and with a strength that belied his small frame, hurled it, 
straight into the back of Kenneths neck. 

  The knight's eys went wide in shock and pain. He turned and saw the
laughing priest as he flashed Kenneth a sly grin, then turned and headed off  
into the forest.                                                              

  Kenneth turned back to the girl. His eyes said the words that his mouth
desperately sought to form, but could not for the amount of blood he was      
coughing up.                                                                  

  "I'm sorry"

  He fell to his knees then, his vision darkening, then fell to his face,
though he did not know it.                                                    

  "I've failed." he whispered.

  He shut his eyes, and darkness overtook him.


                                     .o0o.


  Rhiannon sat, and watched the battle from Kenneth's study. He sneered in
sadistic pleasure when the knight slew a third of the priests, and then       
watched intently while he broke the wolfpack. When he saw that the final two  
had fled, he relaxed, thinking the knight had things well in hand. Indeed, the
young warrior managed to kill one of the fleeing cowards.                     

  However, his attention was focused instantly when Kenneth turned back to
the girl.                                                                     

  'Sargonnas take you, you fool!' he cursed. There, the Chemosh priest turned
and tossed the dagger they all kept hidden somewhere on their persons.        

  Rhiannon's anger rose... that one would *not* be getting away. It was a
simple task to teleport himself to the scene. He appeared directly in the     
priests line of flight. Fortunately, the fools head was turned to watch behind
him.                                                                          

  The Black Robe smiled in satisfaction and unsheated his own dagger, and
calmly inserted it into his foes neck. Then he turned back to look to Kenneth,
but the female knight was already there. Damn! He couldn't let himself be     
seen... the Order would have his head if they knew of his participation, and  
the Knights would not lie about his aid. Speaking a few words, the black mage 
reappeared in Lord Kenneth's study, and gazed into his scrying device.        


                                     .o0o.


  "Stand, my love."

  He was dreaming. He had to be. He only heard her voice in his dreams.

  He slowly opened his eyes, and looked straight into her face.

  She was as beautiful as ever, but there was something different.... her
eyes. There was an infinite sadness in their sapphire depths.                 

  He slowly stood.

  "Hello Shannon." he said simply.

  "Hello Kenneth."

  Her voice... the most beautiful he had ever heard..... he couldn't hold it
anymore. He pulled her close, the dams bursting, the tears flowing down his   
cheeks.                                                                       

  He basked in her warm embrace, as they both held each other tight for
what seemed eternity.                                                         

  "I love you." he whispered.

  "I know." she said with a sad smile. She disengaged herself from his arms
and stood before him.                                                         

  "I've missed you so much." He clenched his fists, the frustration of the
years coming forth as he remembered the lonely nights.                        

  "And I've missed you, love. But your actions have disappointed me."

  He looked up, surprise and shock on his face.

  "You've been living in the past Kenneth, and your future has suffered for
it. My death was regrettable. I've missed you more then words can express, but
I died, Ken. Nothing can change that. I want you to be happy."                

  He turned away from her then, the pain of her words inflicting noticible
pain. But he knew she was right. He had dishonored her memory. By dwelling    
in the past, he had become less then what he had been capable of. But it      
didnt matter any more... she was here with him now.                           

  He turned back and faced her. "I know dearest. But it doesnt matter anymore
We're together again."                                                       

  Now it was she who would not meet his gaze.

  "You cannot stay, Ken. It is not your time. You have much to do yet, and a
chance to save yourself."                                                     

  He knew it had been coming. And to his credit, he beared the news well.

  "Will I see you again?"

  She smiled. "Our love is true Kenneth, nothing can ever break that. I will
be waiting for you. When it is your time, we will walk together for eternity.
But now, you must go. The living need you still."                             

  "I will be impatient." he said, smiling.

  "As will I." she smiled. "But we can delay no longer. You must go now."

  He turned to her one last time, wanting to remember her in all her glory.

  "Goodbye Shannon."

  "Goodbye Kenneth"

  And with that, blackness again overwhelmed him.


                                     .o0o.


  "Damn it! Wake up!"

  The voice, full of concern, came into his head. He opened his eyes and saw
Alena kneeling over him. She sighed audibly in relief.                        

  "I thought I had lost you." she said

  Kenneth noticed the dagger beside her, still sheathed in his blood. It
was relieving to know that Paladine was still with one of them.

  "Not quite. I still have some things to do before I join our gracious lord
Paladine in his kingdom."                                                     

  Alena quietly looked at him. She knew something was different about him...

  "What happened, Ken?" she asked.

  "I saw her Alena. She came to me and admonished me for the way I've lived
since she died... much the way you have all along." here again a smile crossed
his face. "The time was brief, but nothing had changed between us. She waits  
patiently for me. Can I do any less? At least, this time, I got to say
goodbye."

   He looked at her, smiling serenly. With that, he fell silent, withdrawn
into his own thoughts.

   After a lengthy silence, he stood. "Come Alena, let's go home."


                                     .o0o.


   Good, the young knight would live then. All was not lost. Rhiannon stood,
preparing to quit Lord Kenneth's study. His eyes fell on the portrait of his  
daughter.                                                                     

   "I've saved him, Shannon. I've given him his life back. Now I can only hope
that you'll forgive me in death... though I failed to forgive you in life. I  
was so angry when you said you wanted to marry one of the knights... I was so 
angry that you were courting with the enemy...                                

  But I'm only a man, Shannon. And men make mistakes. And I made a mistake.
I should have let you go. I should have let you be happy, instead of worried  
about some imagined insult. I should have saved you that night... I could have
saved you that night... but I did not. I thought it better that the blemish on
my honor be extinguished.                                                     

  I was wrong."

  Rhiannon choked back the tears in his eyes. The study was silent, and he
had to be gone before the knights returned. He quickly completed his spell    
and faded from view.                                                          

  For a moment, though no window was open, a breeze lazily blew thorugh the
study. To any who might have been listening, it might seemed to be whispering 
something along the lines of 'All is forgiven... all is forgiven.'            

  But there were none to hear, save the ghosts and the memories.


                                     .o0o.


  Years later, when Lord Kenneth passed to Huma's breast, it was after a      
long and full life. He had done much right in the world, done much to purge   
it of evil.                                                                   

  He passed away in his sleep, with that same serene smile on his face.
                                                                              
  The transition from life to death wasn't noticible to him. It seemed that   
one moment he had lain down in his manor, and now he was awakening in heaven. 
He sat up, and she was there, sitting beside him.                             
                                                                              
  "Hello Shannon."                                                            

  "Hello Kenneth."
                                                                              
  They embraced then. Tears of joy and sadness were shed.                     
                                                                              
  And they never let each other go, ever again.
