Well, times have been a bit slow, but we've finally scraped together enough
poetry to make it worthwhile. So now, without further ado, here it is.

                            Emotional Terrorist
                            -------------------
                       Beware of the demon inside me
                      Hungry for feelings and emotions
                              Wanting to hold
                                  To touch
                                 To caress
                              Locked in a cage
                              Waiting for more
                                Lashing out
                               Hurting others
                           Tearing at their souls
                             Ripping love apart
                            Feasting on darkness
                               Never quenched
                               Never finished
                               Always hungry.


                                No More Pain
                                ------------
                           I think I found my joy
                             Happiness at last
                              A glint of hope
                                 A feeling
                                 An emotion
                               In one moment
                           Seeming like eternity
                               I feel content
                             At last, satisfied
                             But it's all wrong
                             Never meant to be
                              I let go of love
                             Give up on it all
                     And let it slip through my fingers
                             As it always has.


                                   Blaze
                                   -----
                               As I lie still
                     In the darkness that surrounds me
                               I feel a chill
                           It penetrates my soul
                           But now I see a light
                         A fire in one girl's eyes
                           The flames consume me
                             Burn into my heart
                  And the blaze makes me warm once again.


                              Pit Of Lonliness
                              ----------------
                                 I am alone
                                I am scared
                                I am lonely
                            I fall into the pit
                             A pit of isolation
                                  And fear
                             Deeper and deeper
                                   I fall
                                Until I land
                                I climb out
                                Feeling safe
                                I fall again
                             Faster and harder
                                Until I land
                               My face tears
                               I stay silent
                              Stay in the pit
                        Knowing there is no escape.


                              Blame The Winter
                              ----------------
                             I blame the winter
                            For all my problems
                           For losing my friends
                            For losing my sanity
                             For losing my life
                                Winter comes
                            Slaps me in the face
                             And I lose it all
                           It slaps me yet again
                               Warmth is gone
                                Love is gone
                               I turn around
                             The light is gone
                    And my mind breaks under the strain.


                                 Friendship
                                 ----------
                               I stand alone
                               Inside my mind
                            Lonely, without hope
                         Away from a world of hurt
                          I look at the emptiness
                          My mind is being cracked
                            Chipped away by them
                           The people in my head
                              Memories crumble
                                Sanity fades
                            The foundation falls
                               But I am left
                            Standing in the dark
                               I open my eyes
                               I see a light
                              A beacon of hope
                                 A friend.


                                 Torn Apart
                                 ----------
                               Time passes by
                             My life gets worse
                          With each passing moment
                                 I lash out
                         Desperate to stop the pain
                       To be released from my prison
                          To seek happiness again
                             Everywhere I turn
                               I find no joy
                              Then I find hope
                            I find my happiness
                               I am saisfied
                               I am quenched
                        But another stands in my way
                              Blocking my way
                               So I just stop
                          And leave it all alone.


                               Welcome To Me
                               -------------
                             You don't know me
                     You don't know what I'm capable of
                         I've never been so lonely
                          I've never been so alone
                             I'm never the same
                           Never will be the same
                              I have feelings
                              I have emotions
                      You can't see what I'm thinking
                           What's in my mind now
                             You'll never know
                         You wouldn't want to know
                            Nobody would want to
                             You don't know me
                    You don't know what I'm capable of.

                                  Journey
                                  -------
                       Take my hand and walk with me
                          along the troubled road,
               for God never meant for us to follow it alone.
              But holding hands in pairs the two of us may go.

                    Don't worry, we can share the lead,
                 I can lean on you, and you may lean on me.
           If you need a hand to keep you steady while we climb,
             I shall reach behind me and give you both of mine.

                         And when the road is dark,
                         and not a light in sight,
                     you may point out the stars to me
                         to keep my spirits bright.

                       When the sun is beating down,
                      and you can not stand the heat,
                           I shall keep you safe
                          and shaded in the trees.

                     Sometimes the rocks are slippery,
                         especially after the rain,
                      I promise friend I'll help you,
                       and I know you'll do the same.

               Promise me you'll hold my hand along the way,
                 and I'll promise you I'll never leave you,
                              nary for a day.

                           When you and I are old
                        and the miles are behind us,
                      when the road before us narrows
                      and Death shall seek to find us,

                     You and I shall not be frightened,
                      neither parted nor left behind,
                   but shall only walk then single file,
                 with one hand reaching out in front of us,
                       and the other grasped behind.

                               Troubled Road
                               -------------
                               Troubled road,
                            I'll walk with you,
                       and keep your spirits bright,

                               Troubled road,
                                me and you,
                        straight on into the night.

                               Troubled road,
                            I'll hold your hand,
                         only if you'll hold mine,

                               Troubled road,
                           through troubled land,
                          our fingers intertwined.

                               Troubled road,
                                a sanctuary,
                         within each other's arms,

                               Troubled road,
                            apart we shall nary
                        fall victim to it's charms.

                               Troubled road,
                               for eternity,
                            be there us we two,

                               Troubled road,
                              be you with me,
                          And I shall be with you.

                         May there be a Lord above,
                          our meeting tis a sign,
                            and perhaps forever
                        our souls shall intertwine.

                    And if perchance there is a heaven,
                        then indeed there is a hell,
                         I can see it, so can you,
                       and perhaps it's just as well.

                      But take that not away from us,
                         that which we might gain,
                       surely the impending treasure,
                         dwarfs the chance of pain.

                        Life's a dance, so they say,
                        and you learn it as you go,
                         take a chance, take a bow,
                      and the Lord may watch our show.

                       I know there is a Lord above,
                         "our meeting tis a sign,"
                        my soul has found it's mate,
                        my star has found it's sky.

                        I do not care to see a Hell,
                          but Heaven I may claim,
                     I do not find it among the clouds,
                     but nestled in your arms of clay.

                       Fear not I can not take away,
                         all that we "might gain",
                       I have found my treasure now,
                          I'm sorry for the pain.

                      Life's a dance or oft' you said,
                           but even music slows,
                      I'll take a chance, take a bow,
                        if together we end the show.

                      So you say there's a Lord above,
                       I can take this as it's true.
                       You say this was our destiny,
                          and I was meant for you.

                       Well this I can take to heart,
                      and find Heaven in your embrace,
                         never swear away our love,
                       for we've yet but had a taste.

                      And I know nothing can take away
                          that which me may gain,
                     but the road ahead many be rough,
                      and there may yet be some pain.

                       But never be afraid, my love,
                       for I will always be with you,
                   and perhaps someday, I will simply say

                                   I do.

                             I do not care for
                        any Lord above us or below,
                      I do not care what destiny make,
                         for we shall make our own.

                         You said that of our love
                        "we've had yet but a taste,"
                         well a taste is all I need
                     to swear all else, my Dear, away.

                             I am not afraid of
                          "all that we might gain"
                      no man I know may take our love,
                       though lovers have been known

                       to have a parting of the ways,
                      and many a promise I have known
                            can turn to aches in
                       the heat of a passionate frey.

                        So do not swear you love me,
                             do not say "I do",
                          do not swear that to me
                          you will always be true.

                     For human hearts are made of clay,
                   and though unmeaning, sometimes stray,
                          so do not swear forever
                        because we only have today.

                           And the future, Love,
                         is yet but an empty page,
                            so let me kiss you,
                      silence the words on your lips,
                     and save the pain of heart break.

                          You say you care not for
                       destiny or of the Lord above,
                     for what we want and what we need
                       can be found within our love.

                      You say a taste is all you need,
                      and you'll swear all else away,
                     and a taste I have given unto you,
                       is there nothing else to say?

                     Your heart's not afraid, my Love,
                         of all that we might gain?
                    I wish then I could see your heart,
                       for your actions not the same.

                       I can not swear I'll love you,
                       but I can and have sayed I do,
                       and never had I sworn to thee
                        I would always be all true.

                     Of human hearts, they may be clay,
                         or wind or stone or steel,
                     and "unmeaning, sometimes stray,"
                         but time does always heal.

                       You ask me not swear forever,
                       and your request I will obey,
                        but what of the future love?
                        For soon tomorrow is today.

                            End is the Beginning
                            --------------------
                           how it has come to be,
                             let no man speak.
                         i am alone yet not alone,
            time has replaced what was lost in another with me.
                       though the season grows cold,
                              a time of death;
                     for me there may be new blossoms,
                              in that i hope.

                   fortune alternately smiles and sneers,
                        doing not what pleases man,
                but that which itself derives pleasure from.
                 long is my harmony and brief is my melody,
              if this be the price of being then let it be so.

                          long have i lived alone,
                           but it need not be so,
          all around me there are others if only i choose to see.
                       once more my eyes are opened,
                               if not to love
                               then to hope.

                the mists surround me in a place of dreams,
                      once more i am one with my past.
                        all my life shall i search,
               until at last my ashes to the stars i commit,
          no mere grave dug of the earth for a dreamer such as i.

                     and if my search bears no reward,
               then let my life stand as a beacon for others,
             that i did know i might fail and yet still tried;
                   for in that too there is a greatness,
               a greatness of spirit the despondent know not.

                   what is a man that he regards himself,
             and contemplates not only the living and the dead,
                      but those who may someday live?
                    what spark drives him ever forward,
                     when backwards might better serve?

              in sleep there is solace for one who is forlorn,
                   for in dreams all things are possible.
                     the dead walk not like the living,
                     but as those who have never died.
                 confront the dead in dreams and ask them.

                         one great mind once said,
                    that the almighty does not roll dice
                        with the fabric of reality.
                              i know he does,
              just as surely that i know his dice are loaded.
          the morals of the gods have never semed fair to mortals,
                           why change policy now?
