                       - 02: Darkness Embraced -
                              by Ironhorse


Standing spellbound just outside the bedroom door of the rumored-to-be
haunted home of deceased World League member Jennifer Sanders is little Joey
Russo. He convinced himself after a lot of self-persuasion to check the
bedroom in which from outside he thought he saw a ghost. Now, just before he
fainted, he was sure he did.


                               --+=*=+--


Meanwhile, many miles away...

The large man dressed in dark colors loomed slowly down the alley trying to
decide what he would do next - his name is only Stark, and anything he wants,
he gets.

Just as he realized what should be his next conquest a little blonde haired
girl in pigtails stepped from underneath a fire escape into his path.

Stark looked down to see what many might have considered the sweetest little
face - large baby blue eyes, petite nose, just a smudge of blackness on one
cheek streaked by the trails of her tears, yet a smile bright enough to melt
the coldest heart.

"Can toy help me get my kitty mister?" the little six year old angel asked
brightly while pointing to a cat stuck up on the first floor fire escape
whose ladder had long since rusted and collapsed to the ground.

"Of course," said Stark.

The girl noticed Stark's smile was not friendly but sinister too late as he
lowered his large hand over her head, gripping it tightly and in one deft
swing, flinging her forty-five pound frame through the air. Her back crashed
hard against the railing of the fire escape, mercifully - though to Stark's
annoyance, breaking her spine, killing her - while the force of the impact
continued to spin her frail, lifeless form over the rail, slapping her face
into the mesh steel floor grating of the escape, ruining all of her angelic
features.

Stark looked up at the blood streaked form, noticed the fear frozen in her
dead eyes and smiled.

Then he noticed the cat. It was licking at the blood the was dripping to the
ground below. Suddenly he laughed. Heartily. Evilly. A sound to chill men to
the bone.

"That's right kitty. Dinner time. Dinner fucking- time."


                               --+=*=+--


A few hours later Joey Russo opened his eyes to find he was laying in a bed.
For a second he actually believed it was all a dream... then he realized he
did not get into this bed himself. And more so, as his eyes grew accustomed
to the darkness just beginning to give way to the light of day, he realized
this bed was his own. He was in his bed, in his house, completely on the
opposite side of town as the Sanders' home.

How'd I get here?


                               --+=*=+--


And elsewhere...

Edward Lynch looked up from his table strewn with various charts, graphs,
maps, and assorted folders. Stepping through the door of his study was his
significant other with what appeared to be a mug of hot chocolate. Dressed in
nothing more than a red silk teddy, the five foot four tanned and toned woman
was more than alluring, she was a goddess.

She stopped where she stood when she saw the look on Eddie's face. "I thou-",
she started to say.

"What did I tell you about my study!" Eddie raged.

"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" Lisa screamed as she whirled about heading for the
door, the scalding cocoa splashing against her exposed flesh seeming not to
effect her. She knows how Eddie gets when she's done something wrong.

With the door slammed tight behind her, Lisa waited. Luckily, Eddie did not
come out - Lisa didn't think she had enough make-up to cover any more
bruises, but she did scold herself, because she knew it was her fault. It
always was.


                               --+=*=+--


"You coward!" hollered Stewart Meneke as Joey Russo tried to explain why he
was in his own bed this morning instead of the Sanders' house. "You probably
got all scared and ran home to mommy."

"Did not!" retorted Russo. "I saw it. I know who the ghost of the Sanders'
house is!" At least, he thought he did. After waking in his bed this morning
he did ask his parents what happened in the last fight World League ever had.
His idea is the only one that makes sense...


                               --+=*=+--


Months ago, in downtown Los Angeles...

"So, in a stupendous clash of biblical proportions, World League has defeated
not only Street Vengeance, but an army of were-creatures as well," narrated
the news caster with his bad to the smoldering Hollywood Hills.

"There's Rumble. Let's ask him what happened..."

As the news caster approached the large Russian he turned and said several
things to the man that never made it on the air - something about the painful
removal of parts the newsman was quite attached to was mentioned though.

The only official release from the team was made two days later, faxed to the
Associated Press.


                               --+=*=+--


From the New York Times...
 The first, and what appears to be last
 statement from World League Headquarters
 follows:

 The surviving members of World League,
 [Rumble, Bolt, Surge, Great White, Frost,
 and Condor], regretfully resign their
 posts as international trouble-shooters
 in the areas of super-natural
 occurrences.

 The loss of Jennifer Sanders, formerly
 known as Nighting Gale, and Karen Robbins
 [Flex], has touched the world deeply, and
 we thank you all for your support.

 Services for them will be announced.

 Also gone from us is Great White,
 though not dead, he is no longer with us.

 He will be missed.

 Thanks to everyone for you
 encouragement, and special thanks to the
 Brotherhood's, because if it were not for
 them, we would not have been.

 And if the need ever arises, we'll be
 in touch.

                               --+=*=+--


"Don't you get it? It wasn't her, it was _him_," argued Joey Russo to his new
"friends", the bully, Alex Binder and Arthur Damsky. The four stood in the
Duart Library, which also served as the post office and general store in this
small town.

"But what would he want with the old Sander's house?"

"Yeah. And how'd you get back in your bed?"


                               --+=*=+--


Hours after he chased her from his study, Edward Lynch emerged into the
living room of his Toronto home to find Lisa curled up on the couch in a
fetal position, staring at, but not seeing, the Sunday Matinee on the
television. He quickly seduced her and in no time they were "making love."

Neither noticed this week's showing was "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
Soon, neither one of them cared.


                               --+=*=+--


Stark steps out into the chilly autumn air blowing across the roof top of the
three story apartment building in which he lives. Surveying the dank
surroundings of the city, he looks for the first time dejected. Standing near
the edge of the roof he looks across the street and sees a naked woman
sitting upright and moving up and down in carnal fashion. It is moments
before she notices him and rises to shade the window. He smiles at her and
she quickly pulls the shade and turns away.

Once again he is sullen.

"Everybody wants some," he mumbles, and turns in.


                               --+=*=+--


"So Eddie," coos Lisa from within his arms. "What were you doing in there?"

Eddie's body tensed and for a minute Lisa thought she made yet another of her
innumerable mistakes, but then he relaxed again.

"Something really big kid," he said with a sneer, "something really fucking
big."

Lisa shivered slightly. "W-when are we going back to the States?"

"Soon, baby, soon. We've got an appointment to keep."

"Oh really?" Lisa asked. "With who?"

"The president."

Lisa laughed.

Eddie didn't.


                               --+=*=+--


"Come on!"

"No way!"

"What, are you chicken?"

"No... um. My mom wants me home for lunch. See you later."

And so the bully, Stewart Meneke ran off, leaving Joey Russo standing alone
once again on the steps of the Sanders' home.

"Chicken," Russo said and stepped into the house.

The living room was much more inviting in the mid-day light, even without any
furniture. The night before all the shadows of the trees outside cast into
the vacant home certainly made it _feel_ haunted.

"I can't believe those guys," Russo said to himself. "Haunted. Hah, there's
no such thing as ghosts."

"Then you've figured me out..." said a voice somewhere in Russo's head.

The little boy jumped and then steeled himself. Looking around he could
barely make out a man-like shape of dim light moving towards him with the sun
to it's "back."

"Yes, and I know who you are too," Russo said defensively.

"I can see that. Well, Joey, my friends here call me Warren."

And the little boy smiled up at the light. He was right.



 Ever more to come...
