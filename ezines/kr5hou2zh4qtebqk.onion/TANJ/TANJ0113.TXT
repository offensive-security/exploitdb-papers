very depressed. very lonely.

lost my job two weeks ago. i suppose i should have written sooner and told you
all about it, but i've been walllowing through too many things lately..

i've been sleeping fourteen hours a day, sleeping through the daylight hours,
awake until sunrise.. vodka & idle computer things, books & movies.. pushing
everyone - everyone - out of my life..

in my own special way, i guess i've pushed you away, too. i could have
written, or stopped by, even. i was in pennsylvania the other day.. i just
drove and drove.. 300 miles through strange little pennsylvanian towns.
sleeping in the car..

jill's crept back into my life to some extent. i demonstrated to her the
difference between "up" and "down", and now she's out again.

nancy was just here, she got here last night after the nitzer ebb show at the
limelight. i didn't look at her, haven't looked at her - just went to sleep.
we woke up about 1pm, she wanted me to be happy happy, fun fun fun. i laid on
the floor with a hat covering my face, and all i kept saying was, "i'm sorry."
she finally left..

i keep forgetting to eat. i've lost weight, i think. i seem much leaner. this
is a good thing, at least i can be content with my appearance as i deteriorate
into nothingness.

my life is a merry-go-round of disaster.

i should write a resume, but i don't have enough energy. i'm feeling very
apathetic.

jim should be here before the week is over with my lsd. i told him i wanted to
experiment, wanted to have bad bad trips and scare myself. told him i wanted
to see what i'd write about.. told him i just wanted another escape from
reality, but we'd ignore that bit for the time being.

well.

nothing much to say..

i hope things are better for you than they are for me.

wrote a resume the other day (4 am). it's horrible, but i'm going to have to
live with it.

listening to the cranes. staring at this old taco bell garbage. smelling
jill's sex all over me.

i guess we both know what i've been up to.

my relatives are up from florida (!?!) visiting. my brother, his wife, two
kids. he's in his mid thirties, i guess. they got here two days ago. i haven't
seen them yet, i've been avoiding them.. slinking around the house, only going
out of my room in the middle of the night..

i don't know him, you know? just because we both came out of the same hole
doesn't mean we have to be best friends.

my contacts are getting blurry.

i'm never going to meet anyone at a club who interests me. i guess i've
realized this (finally), and that's why i've stopped going out. the whole
thing disgusts me.

blah, blah, blah.

jesus, i need a haircut.

unemployment is awful. i have to actually budget my money. i can't stand it.
if i don't have $100-$150 to spend on absolute *trash* each week, i don't know
what to do with myself.

i just wish i could afford a haircut.

foo.

where's jim, anyway? where're my drugs?

been listening to george thorogood lately. that "one bourbon, one scotch, one
beer" song has some sort of a hypnotic effect over me.

i always mix up effect & affect. hmm.

walked past some bar last night at the beach, and realized that this time next
year, i'll probably be propped up on one of those stools. mmm.

have a nice day.

imagine that, you coming to visit me..

i've got sunburn. how ungoth. i went plodding around old war derelicts at
sandy hook.

the sperm bank thing turned out to be a joke, sorry. i took it as a joke to
begin with, but i figured - - hey, the work's not hard, i do it already, and i
may as well get paid for it..

hope you find a use for the ENCLOSED ENVELOPE.

my relatives are still here, i'm still dodging them.

i haven't looked at the alien thing yet, but i will. i remember hearing about
them somewhere, but i never found out more. i always confuse them with some
skateboard company called "alien workshop".

so, what's chet's new job? and if he's got a job, why's he want to masturbate
for money..? aren't you woman enough for him? didn't he like the pierced
tongue..?

tee-hee-hee.

i'm broke as all hell. i've been eating cheese & crackers. ack, ack, ack.

i don't go out to clubs near as much as you think. not nearly..

i need to steal a better printer. this thing is horrible.

i finally wrote my resume, but i can't print the thing out on this bastard
printer. it looks awful. i have to drive up to brookdale community college
(where i stole this computer from) and pretend to be a student for awhile so i
can use a decent printer. i should've been able to go use the printer at work,
but.. of course.. i don't work there anymore.

feels like my eyes are going to fall out.

too damned hot. i've had the air-conditioning on for the past three days, 24
hours a day..

i''ve lost lots of weight. i love it. i think i'm going to be poor more often.
you should try it sometime, it's lots of fun.

you shouldn't be finding men you're interested it, be they 27 year old
brooklynites or not, considering you have a significant other. shame, shame..

my kingdom for a haircut.

went and saw "party girl" the other night with jill. what an experience. the
story about sysiphus (syphilis?) was the best part.

sunburn is a bad thing.

jill & i seem to be getting more friendly. this is fine, we've been trading
"guess who i fucked" stories. i just don't want whatever it was that happened
last time to happen again.

then again, i enjoy sex with her.. she did this entertaining thing with ice
cubes earlier..

mmmm.

maybe i should finally mail this letter..

it'll please you to know that making this black envelope was my last real duty
as a $7.35/hr record store worker. you see how much i slave over you?

                              drunk and miserable
                                 back to normal
                                back to reality

                                 happy birthday
                                   young man
                                   young man

                          hours twist away into liquid
                         into indistinguishable frowns
                                 of disapproval

                            years speckle the walls
                                time spent idle
                                  time wasted

                           closeted hopes and dreams
                                    smashed
                                  thrown aside

                         what does it matter in the end
                                when all is said
                               and little is done

                         mocking faces in the darkness
                               haunting my dreams
                                scarring my soul

                                    no peace
                                    no rest
                                  no salvation

                                  just madness
                                  and alcohol
                                and degradation

                                this is reality
                                  this is life
                            this is the all there is

                                    anywhere
                                    anything
                                     anyone

6 am, driving down the highway, and i came across this woman. tight white
shorts, long hair, nice figure.

i drove around the block so that i could pass by her.

she just stood there, looking at me.

i went around the block again, waved as i passed by.

she smiled down into the car, opened the door, got in.

we drove off.

i found a secluded spot behind the local elk's club. gave her $20, unzipped my
pants.

i made her stop halfway through, and told her i wanted to kiss her.

"i don't usually do that kind of thing," she said, and we kissed.

she went back to work.

i was very kind, gentle. stroking her hair and face very softly -  almost as a
lover would.

she finished and we drove off.

i drove her to 8th street, cheap welfare apartments. she had to find some girl
who owed her money.

she had told me that she'd pay me $5 to drive her around.

we didn't find her, but we picked up pam, a big black girl. very loud. very
obnoxious.

we went over to the riviera.

"crack street," she called it.

i let them out, parked, waited.

they knocked on a few doors, then disappeared around the corner.

after a few minutes, she came running back to the car, crying.

"that nigger bitch" she said, "she stole my money."

two or three people came out of the motel.

she got back into the car, still crying. two people from the motel somehow got
in the backseat.

i drove them all 20 minutes out of town, down to where she lived.

got there, pulled up to the curb, stopped. they all got out.

"wait here for them" she said, and they all went inside.

i waited maybe one, two minutes.

i got out of there, back on the highway.

i was more than generous, i thought, driving these strangers around for more
than forty-five minutes.

i left them there, in that blue and white mobile home. in awhile, they'd just
be memories.

for all of my kindness and generosity, i was just another piece of flesh
between her lips.

some people will never see beauty.

                           i talked to jim last night
                          we traded relationship woes
                  told him about you & chet & frank ad nauseum
                              he wants to meet you
                      jim's never met a really kinky woman
                                    poor jim
                              he hasn't moved yet
                         i guess it's ok to ignore him

                            i wonder what you think
                          when you unfold the crumples
                              and read it all out
                        stumbling over misspelled words
                               and horrible typos
                                     wonder
                                  what you see
                                   in between
                                all those lines

                                 my head hurts
                i'm never going to find anyone interesting here

                             i told jim last night
                       that 98% of the peope in the world
                                  were boring
                                 or was it 99%?
                             i can't quite remember

                              and then i told him
                       that the ones who were interesting
                               either had a penis
                          (which is fine, i told him)
                      or are so fucked up in relationships
                   that it isn't worth the time investigating

                          i don't know what i'm doing

                      jim said he wanted to find that girl
                       that made him want to go on living
                           said he found them before,
                                 a few of them,
                                but it went away
                                  after awhile

                         i told him jill was like that
                            she made me want to live
                                     until
                                  that one day
                                  when it all
                                 just went away

                           i don't know what happened

                                   i told him
                             i was tired of looking
                              for people like that
                                i didn't explain
                            but i think we both knew
                              that wanting to live
                          comes from somewhere inside

                         he's got a way of being funny

                           told him i wanted support
                               a companion, maybe

                                  i reflected

                             i guess i want a wife
                            it sure sounds that way

                                     stupid
                                  stupid moron
                                look at yourself
                                how old are you?
                               stop being so old
                               stop being so dead
                                      stop
                                     being
                                       so
                                     damned
                                     stupid

                       why don't you do like you're told?
                                     go out
                                   get drunk
                                   get fucked
                                    get high
                                   get wasted
                                   get happy
                                 ha ha ha ha ha
                                   get happy
                             and just cruise along

i never knew your last name until the other day when you left that message.
odd..

on a whim this past morning i shuffled off to the library and browsed through
"the 1995 poet's market book." i looked at this, mainly, because they didn't
have "the 1995 people-who-just-write-bad-letters market book." i found a few
places that i'm probably going to start sending stuff to. probably just
photocopies of all this shit in my drawer, scraps of things..

well, it's not exactly a job, but it's something to do for five minutes every
once in awhile.

mmm.

i pushed jill out of my life two weeks ago, and tonight i went and visited
nancy. she called earlier in the day and kept nagging me to visit her. i
didn't really want to see her, but she kept at it, so.. i got up there and
laid on the floor and listened to her whining about her social life. when she
was done, i told her something along the lines of, "your social life disgusts
me." this wasn't meant in a bad way or anything, it's just the honest truth.
her social life really does disgust me.

at any rate, she got all bitchy over it. "fine," i said, "i'll leave." she
asked me why i had come to see her in the first place, so, being a good boy
scout, i told her the truth. "because you kept nagging me," i said. this,
apparently, didn't set too well either.

i just laid there on the floor. she smoked a cigarette. after awhile, she went
into another room. she came back in, threw a book at me. damned thing hit me
in the stomach, hurt quite a bit. i said something like, "jesus christ,
whore!" and threw the thing back at her. i was overcome with this intense
desire to beat the shit out of her. instead, i got up and left.

ironically enough, it was charles bukowski's "women" that she had thrown at
me. she borrowed it from me, and i guess she was trying to give it back..

i drove into the city and set out to find a bottle of stolichnaya vodka, but
it was already pretty late and all the liquor stores were closed. i wandered
around st.mark's place for awhile, then drove home.

here i am now, home.

there was a message on my machine from her, it said something like this: "if
everything disgusts you so much, why don't you just shoot yourself?"

several points leapt to mind:

..her cheesy social life in no way constitutes "everything". ..she's the one
with the suicidal problems, not me. (tried two or three times.) ..bullets
aren't stylish. i'd try and do it stylishly if it were my last act. ..she's
very fucking teenage, and i don't know why i let myself sink that low.

well, anyway.. i think i've succeeded in getting her out of my life, too. i
certainly hope so..

alone again, alone again, yippity-yippity.

on the lighter side: i haven't had sex in over a month. masturbation is a
poor, poor replacement. i'm going to see about going out this weekend and
finding something to fuck.

in reality, though, i don't even want that. i don't care about all the hot,
sweaty mechanics of it. what i really want is the part that comes after -
laying around in bed,  naked, content, happy. holding each other. gentle
kisses. light touches. stroking hair. falling asleep together..

i sound like a woman, jesus. using sex to get love, and all that.

jim still hasn't gotten me my damned lsd, but he did find me some mushrooms.
here's to a mind altering experience..

hope you're ok.. wonder why you put up with me.. etc..


     /////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////////////////////



- it's sunday, i think.

jim never got my mushrooms. jim's kind of unreliable like that.. i haven't
been back to the city to fetch alcohol, either, but my mother shocked & amazed
me by driving off to yonder liquor store and getting me some. how odd..

anyway, my stepbrother is here with his tart girlfriend. they're sitting out
on the couch in the living room. he's a redneck bastard. i've avoided him for
the past.. oh.. five years or so? the last time i really associated with him,
i tried to strangle him to death. he's just that kind of person.

depeche my mode, baby.

started talking to some girl, jessica. she got kicked out of cornell, failed
out. she was pursuing too many.. shall we say, extracurricular activities? the
only things we've talked about are sex, which is fine with me. cheap,
entertaining, burns calories..

my life reminds me of a sister's of mercy lyric. (i'm such a little gothboy,
aren't i?) that line, "and the women come and go." well, mostly they just go,
but..

cough, cough, cough.

only another.. what.. twenty weeks of "vacation" to go..

i need to steal a better printer. jesus christ. i hate this thing.

i made the mistake of going to the mall today, trying to escape my
stepbrother. what a bad idea. people everywhere.. everywhere.. thousands of
them.. i just couldn't deal with it. all that noise, kids screaming.. the
faces, the happy happy smiling faces.. "i love you, frank!" "oh, mary! i love
you!".. overstuffed asses crammed into pastel colored tents.. it was just too
much. i had to piss, i had to get to a bathroom and piss and get out of there,
but i couldn't. i just couldn't take it. i found the exit, got outside, got
back to the car. i sat there in the front seat and pissed in a spring water
container, and sat it on the ground. it was really that bad.

i fucked up and couldn't go to the batcave - again. this is the second week in
a row i've wanted to go, but couldn't. this time, i had been awake for sixteen
hours before, and was dead tired. i slept six hours, got up to get dressed and
go out. it was pouring rain, a monsoon. it had been raining for eight hours or
so, i think. i started to wonder if i had left my car windows down.. sure
enough, puddles in the front seat. i had some toast and went back to sleep for
another eight hours.

cough, cough, cough.

i cough like a smoker now, for no apparent reason. i'm not sick.. i just don't
understand.

this letter is so completely empty, i'm sorry.

i wonder when you'll throw out all the things i've written you. it's got to
happen, sooner or later. one day, one of us will run out of things to say, and
the other won't pursue the matter.. and that'll be it. or,  maybe you'll throw
a god damned bukowski book at my head, i'll call you a whore, and we'll hate
each other. i guess you never know..

i can never figure out if i'm alone by choice or not. i suppose i am, being
i'm the one who drives everyone away.. but it never seems like that. it always
feels like i've been left, i've been forgotten about.

compassion doesn't exist, you know. it just doesn't exist..

etc.
