                                  by Tal Meta

It's index time again. Last time I wrote one of these, I was a newlywed and an
expectant father. Now I'm semi-employed, and a full time father to an 18 month
old daughter. So it goes. I've expanded this magazine's frontiers a bit, adding
internet sites to the list of places to find it, and even run a "mailing list"
for interested parties to get the 'zine early.

Caring for my daughter hasn't left me alot of time to write, but the stuff I
have choked out I think is some of my best yet.

hypotheitcal RPG campaign I might someday run, using elements from BattleTech,
Cyberpunk, Call of Cthulhu, & Star Frontiers. There is no set length to the
series I'm plannning in this universe, although one of the stories I'm working
on has lay dormant now for close to six months...

has been kind enough to permit me to republish several of her stories.

Description      : Flashback
Written By       : Tal Meta (w/Angelique)
Date Released    : 3-19-96

A little over two years ago, Angelique and I sat near a streambed in eastern
Pennsylvania as she slowly spun out the story around which this piece of fiction
is based. I tried on several occasions to write this story straight, but never
succeeded. I never intended for this story to go beyond where I left it here,
but nearly everyone who's commented on it has asked me "Is that it?" so I'm
presently working on two sequels to it. Part 2 is already finished; I just have
to let Angelique read it first (she doesn't have a computer as such, just a word
processor.)

Suffice it to say, the story isn't over yet.

Written By       : Tal Meta
Date Released    : 3-29-96

This story, like the first, was woven together out of several dozen dreams I've
had over the past few years. It didn't start out as erotica, but it gradually
got there on its own. Towards the end of writing this I started dreaming in the
pieces to fit the rest.

This story came to me by way of the internet distribution list I started up a
few weeks ago for TANJ. One of the subscribers said he had stuff to contribute,
and here is the first of his contributions. Originally I was going to release
Flashback 2 as #119, but delays in getting myself to Angelique's place continue
to stall it's release.

You're reading it.


Thats it for this index. Look for the completion of Arifel's Metamorph story,
Flashback 2 & 3, a collaborative story set in Arifel's Metamorph universe, a
half-vulcan-half-betazoid meets half-klingon-half-human ST:TNG story, more from
Laura Lemay, and more real life interplay from Hairy in upcoming issues of TANJ.

Thanx for reading us!
