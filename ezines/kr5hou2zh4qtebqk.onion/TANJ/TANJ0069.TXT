                         - Vanity, thy Name is Woman -
                                  by Tal Meta


Ah, vanity. It is an attribute primarily associated with women, and this
particular file will be a tribute to one woman's vanity. But before I begin,
a bit of background is in order....

Once upon a time, there was a female sysop who had what she herself called a
"nasty rep". Sadly enough, this file isn't about how she got that "rep". No
sir, its about some statements she made once upon a time in chat with a
couple of people I know (people who save things, 'cuz you just never know
what will come in handy, ya know?) and here are a few of the things she had
to say about good 'ol TANJ....

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ahhhh....then you may have read several of those Tanj files....I have only
seen one but am looking for the rest as I was informed of some very serious,
very sick, lies that were included in them....derf is someones name spelled
in reverse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

oh, cuz I was gonna ask you, if you still have those 14-15 files, if you
would be a sweetie and upload them to me....I really want to see what exactly
has been said about me personally

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sorry, I didn't mean it that way, but I need to know as much as I can right
now. ...I need to know what these files and these people have said and are
saying about me, if you can remember any of it at all 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

damn....not your fault....see, I really NEED these files yesterday! I'd
explain why if ya like, but its not that important

--Well, why?

because I can hard-copy them and file charges of Slander against a public
figure

--Slander is very difficult, if not impossible to prove though. I have
--heard of many cases, and I have taken pre-law courses. One of the --hardest
crimes to prove.

True, but each of these files are traceable to one local -Tals bbs- as a
point of origin, I talked with a friend of mine last night and he said it
could be done quite easily

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I'll admit, those statements were made quite awhile ago... and, of
course, she's never tried taking me to court for slander or anything else.
Whether this is because to prove slander you have to demostrate that the
statements made against you were FALSE, or simply due to apathy on her part,
i dunno. Maybe its because sysops hardly qualify as "public figures". But
someone reminded me that at the time, I had said I was going to make a file
called "Vanity, Thy name is Woman". So, times being a bit slow, I decided,
why not? :)

The deepest, darkest secret to the entire TANJ Conspiracy is that the lady in
question is in fact in ALMOST EVERY FILE WE'VE EVER WRITTEN! It's an
unwritten rule that anyone who wishes to submit a file must somewhere mention
her. I'll even give her a file by file listing of exactly where and in what
way she is being "slandered" in each and every file. I'm nothing if not
helpfull, you see. :)

---TANJ.000      tanj writers guide

The secret to this file is that it's CRC value, when fed into a gematria
program, will reveal the "true name" of our female sysop. Honest! :)

---TANJ.001      how to host a bust

While not directly mentioned anywhere in this file, she is nevertheless there
simply because her husband claims to have engineered my bust, no doubt to
"silence" my viscious lies!

---TANJ.002      words to live by

The quotes beginning on lines 27, 89, 98, 102, 116, & 251 all could be
construed as having something to do with our heroine. In fact, the one on 251
was originally created in a post I made to her, when she was commenting on
how wretched her life was. Go figure.

---TANJ.003      the last mile

She appears again in this file, as its about my brush with the law. As a
curious aside, the very morning I left for the vacation mentioned in the
file, my fiancee & I spotted them at a gas station at 4ish in the morning. We
kept our heads low and got out quick! :)

---TANJ.004      this ain't no sanfile / i hate banks

We had fun with this one. Careful analysis of the file will reveal that each
of the letters in her handle have been used EXACTLY 69 times.

---TANJ.006      on the origins of derf

Hey, she even gets her name mentioned outright in this one. What more do you
want? :)

---TANJ.007      at the end of my rope

Another "brush with the law" file. If only her husband hadn't tried to take
me out this way....

---TANJ.009      blood lust 01: the awakening

This file is mostly about blood, gore, and death. Bosch always liked gore &
death, which is why our heroine is in EVERY scene. Even when Mordecai is
alone, she's there. But she's never one of the victims. She's one of the
knives. I'll leave it up to you to decide which one.

---TANJ.011      blood lust 02: the consumation

Bosch tells me that in this file, she's the OTHER knife.

---TANJ.013      poems & memories

I have quite a collection of poems the women in my life have written. In this
file, there is a poem that shares a name in common with AB. Go read it, it's
quite good. Come to think of it, I have a few of AB's poems about... I wonder
if she'd mind? :)

---TANJ.014      going crazy in the suburbs 01

Read line 571. its right there. Go, do it now!

---TANJ.015      terrible lies

Since this file gives voice to derf, it also relates directly back on AB. In
the eyes of the law, they are one. One what, is the question though.

---TANJ.016      the abduction of a social geek

Since all of the "evil people" who have supposedly spread lies about AB are
mentioned in this file, she is here in spirit.

---TANJ.018      the 69 laws of bbsing

Its all in the title. We're evil.

---TANJ.019      man of steel / woman of kleenex

Since this file centers around sex... well, you get the picture.

---TANJ.024      the night that changed my life

Our heroine was in the Chinese restraunt (owned by Russians) at the
mini-mall. Again, she's not directly mentioned, but you just KNOW she's in
there, ya know?

---TANJ.027      going crazy in the suburbs 03

Read line 268, and wonder....

---TANJ.034      stan the flying roach

AB is in fact Mrs. Johnson, although none of the other members of the Johnson
Clan are related to her in any way. its just one of those mysteries, you
know?

---TANJ.035      star white and the seven derfs

Queen Pacifica. Need we say more?

---TANJ.037      adjourned again, naturally...

Its a legal TANJ, and we've already established the link...

---TANJ.044      final mission

In this file, AB appears as the grandmother in the final scene.

---TANJ.048      aristarchus of shiran: 01

All I'm going to say is.... AB is NOT Elissa. At all.

---TANJ.058      how do you plead?

It was Derf's faault... he says so. She was there, in the courtroom, but
never mentioned. its the link.

---TANJ.061      throckmorton of amber 01

AB is personified by the third emerald to the left in the Dragon's lair, you
know, the one that buried the nasties.

---TANJ.062      not necessarily the evening news

Mr. & Mrs. John Q Public indeed!

---TANJ.065      rage of angels

If the title doesn't give it all away, I don't know what possibly could.

---TANJ.066      blood lust 03: the marriage

Bosch tells me that in this file, AB is the third of the five musicians. And
is not either of the knives in this story. Amazing, the subtlety of it all,
yes?

---TANJ.067      offramp to hell

Remember the wall? Where the demons were working the humans? Look about
10,354 people over to the left, and there she is, plain as day, a load of
bricks on her sholder. She's also in the bar where Lennon was singling,
relaxing after a hard day's night, but don;t ask me where, ok?

---TANJ.069      vanity, thy name is woman

Now, of course, this file is entirely about AB. Every last word. Every word
the total, absolute truth. Hope you enjoyed it as much as we have. And AB, I
really hope this helps your case. The thought of you wasting money on a
lawyer to pursue this nonsense amuses me to no end. Life is, afterall,
exactly like a box....
