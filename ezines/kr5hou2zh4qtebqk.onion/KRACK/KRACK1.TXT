 Issue: Phreaking Basics
 
  First off the term "Phreaking" is a faster way to say Telephone Fraud.
Telephone is a serious crime and I do not recomend you try it because of the
seriousness of it, a few penilities of phreaking is 1. Inprisonment (18 years
or older) 2. Confiscated computer (third offence) 3. Pay for telephone bill
(most common) 4. Community service (50-100hrs) (I dont think they have changed)
for more information of busted phreakers please read ending
  The most common ways of going about phreaking is geting an extender
(1800-225-5946 which might have been in use).  The extenders resemble bulk
mailing in the post office, which companies order it for a periof of time at a
reduced rate.  After you dial the extender there will be a recording telling
you to enter a code, most codes run from 5-11 digits, finding how many digits
is the trickey part. After you enter the aurthirization code it may then ask
you for the phone number you wish to dial.  The important thing is that you
don't enter the 1 before the area code!  This method of phreaking is commonly
refered to as ACN (Extender - Code - Number).  Some extenders have it reversed
to ANC (Extender - Number - Code).
  That's the basic phreaking way and I do not recomend you trying this and I do
not take any responsibility for your actions! Well thats is for this issue, and
they will get in depth as you learn more about the basics.

  Teen-Ager Faces Felony Charges In Computer Crimes
 
Date:
~~~~~
  August 9, 1988
 
 
Article:
~~~~~~~~
  Using a personal computer to break into AT&T and government computers and
steal more than $1 million worth of software. This is not malicious mischief,"
U.s. Attorney Anton Valukas said in announcing the federal charges. "It's a
felony."  Herbert Zinn Jr., 18, also is accused of advertising on a computer
bulletin board how to break into AT&T's computers electronically. The charges
against Zinn mark the start of "an aggressive position toward computer crimes,
"Valukas said.  Zinn allegedly committed the crimes when he was a juvenile, and
could be sent to prison until his 21st birthday in August 1991.  Federal agents
raided Zinn's home last year and confiscated three computers and software
allegedly stolen during the electronic break-ins.
  The federal charges were brought after Zinn had been arrested several
times, including for alleged computer break-ins at the Keller Graduate School
of Management and at Commodity Perspective Inc., both in Chicago.  "Before and
after the computer break-ins (at Keller and Commodity Perspective), Zinn was,
by his own admission, breaking into AT&T computers," Valukas said.  Court
documents said Zinn broke into an AT&T computer at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's Maintenance and Supply Headquarters in Burlington, N.C.,
and an AT&T computer at Robins Air Force Base, Ga.  Valukas said the software
taken from NATO and the Air Force base were "low level in terms of
sensitivity."  Agents raided Zinn's home after an AT&T security officer logged
onto the so-called Phreak Class-2600 computer bulletin board and spotted
messages signed by "Shadow Hawk," a code name the government said the teen-ager
used.  Shadow Hawk bragged in the messages that he had gained access to AT&T
computer files, but he inadvertently included his telephone number.

  17 Arrested in High-Tech Phone Fraud
 
Date:
~~~~~
  April 27, 1988 - Newsweek Newspaper
 
Article:
~~~~~~~~
  HONOLULU--AP
   It was high-tech robbery -- the theft and sale of long-distance telephone
service.  Seventeen people in 13 states were arrested Monday. The charge:
conspiracy to commit access device fraud and wire fraud. The victims: U.S.
Sprint, MCI Corp., Allnet Corp.,ITT, Tri-Tel Communications.  Their loss: a
reported $125 million in the past year.  Steve Ramsay of the Secret Service
said those charged sold access codes for $80 to $150 a month.   An access code
-- a telephone credit card number-- allows callers to use long-distance phone
lines. Calls were billed to that card number. The distributors often sold one
code to hundreds, maybe thousands of people, Ramsey said. Charged to one number
in four days: $73,592.  According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Godbey:
Computers were programmed to call the companies' long distance networks, then
enter a credit card number to pay for the call. If the number was rejected, the
computer kept dialing until one was accepted. The successful number then was
sold. Whoever was assigned the number, got the bill. "It was the miracle of
technology, the computer took a simple chore and did it over and over and
over," he said. The Secret Service caugt them by setting up their own
distributorship of illegal numbers -- a "sting operation" -- and "making
controlled diliveries," Ramsey said.

Isssue: News Updates!
 
Hacking Clubs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Early computer hackers tended to be college students.  With the advent
of home computers, and the teaching of computer basics at the grade
school level, the average age of the begininning (youth) hacker has
dropped to only 14!!  The overwhelming majority of BBS owners and users
are teenagers.  Teens tend to form cliques and peer groups, so the
formation of phone phreak and hacker gangs was inevitable.  The parents
of these bright teens usually do not, themselves, understand the power
of the computer.  This means that the teens are not subject to the same
parental restrictions that would govern their using the family car.
 
Many parents veiw the home computer as an excellent baby-sitting device.
If their child spends an evening quietly in his/her room with the computer
the parents feel that thier offspring is not getting into any trouble.
In reality, these teens may be engaging in electronic gang activites
that have very serious implications.  Losses to the software industry
alone are staggering!!!
 
Unfortunately, many of the gang leaders are older, more experienced
teens, perhaps college students.  These people are interested in hacking
not for its intellectual challenge, for for its financial rewards.  A
few gang leaders are adults who are politically or firal adults who are
major figures behind the cracking and distribution of pirated software for
resale to the public.  One adult gang leader openly solicited credit card
numbers from the juvenile members in exchange for fraudulently obtained hard
disk drives and other equipment.  Some of the teenage leaders seek
notoriety and acclaim from their peers.  They strive to be the biggest
phreaker or to have broken into the greatest number of computer systems.
 
The gangs may be local in nature such as the infamous "Milwaukee 414
gang"; they may be national in nature, like the "Inner Circle"; or
even international.  One such international group is "NYSHII" or
"CHAOS" both cracking and pirating clubs with headquaters in both
West Germany and the United States.  All of these groups had a BBS
that was their main base of operations and served supposedly as a
sercure communications center.  The 414s had a private BBS that was
so sercet it didn't even have a name.  The Inner Circle had a
Securityland BBS and Illegitimate accounts on GTE'S Telemail network.
Chaos operates on a variety of BBS's in both the U.S. and West Germany.
NYSHII (New York Safehouse II) to this date has baffled local and
international law enforcement agencys as to it's true whereabouts.
The Sysop "The Line Breaker" has found a way of changing the BBS's
location on a weekly basis without moving the master computer.
 
Orginzed Crime News Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Naturally, an underground BBS could be used by organized crime in
much the same manner as the teen hacker gangs use them.  The author
has good reason to believe thgat organized crime is controlling a
number of BBS systems in the Midwest, the New York City area, and
in Florida.  One informant claims there is a bbs that is located
in an off-track betting parlor.  Teenagers are easily recruited to
act as information gathers for organized crime.  The young people
work for little or nothing and, in most cases, do not even know
that they are being used.  The author and other adult hackers have
been approached and offered large sums of money to tamper with
banking and credit data computer systems.  Organized crime is
moving into this new area of crime.  There is a real and present
danger if BBSs continue to be alloowed to operate unchecked.
 
Underground BBSs may be creating a whole new generation of
criminals.  As the youthful hackers mature, their interest in hacking
as an intellectual challenge and rebellion against authority
may be replaced by profit motive.  College students always seem
to need money and the teens who do not go to college may find it
difficult to obtain a job.  It is only natural that these individuals
would graviate into hacking for personal gain.  For example, many
bulletin boards cater to those who are involved in credit card fraud.
There is also evidence that drug dealers use BBSs to arrange swaps
of stolen property for drugs.  Hackers who have learned how to access
credit bureau systems, such as TRWs, have discovered that making
unauthorized credit checks foe
business.
 
Credit bureau computer penetrations are routine in the hacker under-
ground.  The typical hacker gang obtains credit card numbers from
discarded charge slip carbons.  As an alternative, one or more
hackers who work in retail establishments may supply card numbers.
Other gang members can then check the cards for credit limits and
expiuration dates by using the telephone or illegally accessing
credit bureau computers.  Others in the gang set up mail drops
and safe houses for the deliverly of the merchandise ordered by mail
and charged to the credit card numbers.  Since the gangs know no
geographic boundaries, it is difficult to investigate these frauds.
 
Some commerical time-sharing services, such as Comp-u-serve, allow
merchandise to be ordered via computer and shipped to the user's
address.  ime-sharing accounts are easily obtained with a stolen
credit card.  This allows the thief to order merchandise with little
fear of being traced.  These new high tech thieves are replacing
more traditional criminals.
 
The hackers and phone phreaks have knowledge and skill to completly
disrupt major communication and computer networks.  All that is lacking
is organization, planning and financing.  If enemy power should
infiltrate and organize this underground, the consequences could
be disastrous.
 
 
Subversive Bulletin Boards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An article in a newspaper from the United Kingdom had an article relating to a
computer bulletin board being run by a 14-year-old boy in Wilmslow, Cheshire,
England.  It contained information relating to such things as making plastic
explosives.
 
Anti-terrorist detectives are said to be investigating for possible breaches of
the Obscene Publications Act.  Apparently reporters were able to easily gain
access to this bulletin board and peruse articles on such subjects as credit
card fraud, making various types of explosives, street fighting techniques and
dodging police radar traps.
 
One article was obviously aimed at children and described how to make a bomb
suitable for use on "the car of a teacher you do not like at school," which
would destroy the tire of a car when it was started.
 
The boy's parents did not seem to think that their son was doing anything
wrong, preferring him to be working with his computer rather than roaming the
streets.
 
A London computer consultant, Noel Bradford, is quoted as having seen the
bulletin board and found messages discussing "how to crack British Telecom, how
to get money out of people and how to defraud credit card companies.  Credit
card numbers are given, along with PIN numbers, names, addresses and other
details."

Nasa Breakin Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Boy tells of 'WAR GAMES' on NASA computers
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.(AP)-One of four teenagers whose home computers were seized
by the FBI after an ilegal tap into NASA computers likend his electronic
forays to those in the movie "WAR GAMES," and one of the boys mothers said
they never ment any harm.
 
 "We didn't find anything top secret or anything we thought was top secret,
just stuff about space and sattelites," Joe Moorman, 13, said after the
FBI on onday seized home computers, floppy disks and software that were
allegedly used to tap into two computers, according to the FBI.
 
 The unauthorized taps destroyed records and blocked scientists from using
the computers, according to the FBI.
 
 "It was sort of like 'War Games,'" which depicted a students unauthorized
entery into a strategic defense computer, Moorman said. "We used an automatic
dialer to print out all the codes until we got the right one." printers were
also seized from the youths' residences.
 
 The two NASA computers that were broken into contained no classified
information, but secret passwords and access numbers were needed to use either
machine, NASA officials said.
 
 "Valuable computer time was stolen and certain computer records have been
destroyed by persons who made the penetrations," said Cecil Moses, special
agent in charge of the FBI's Birmingham office.
 
 Charges have not been filed against the teenagers, but may be filed later,
said Moses. Conviction for theft or destruction of government property
carries a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment.
 
 "NASA had good countermeasures in their system to discover any penetration
and it took us about 10 days to trace the origin," said Tom Moore, an FBI
spokesman.
 
 There has been no indication of any attempt to tap into NASA computers at
the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., or the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, officials said.
 
 Tapping even the administrative computers "Has been made as diffucult as
possible," said Hugh Harris, a spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center.
A series of passwords and identefication codes must be used to gain access
to these computers, and these are periodically changed, he said.
 
 Scientists at Marshall discoverd the computer break-in June 28 and reported
it to the FBI, said Moses. The scientists were unable to use the computers
whial the "hackers" were working on them, he said.
 
 The telephones through which the data banks were tapped were traced to
the four residences raided Monday, which are all in the same area of
Huntsville, said Moses and Moore.
 
 The FBI did not release the names of the teenagers, but residences where
computer equipment was seized were identified by federal agents as those
of William H. Graham, George R. Grumbles, Dr. Robert S. Moorman Jr. and
Mark A. Strickland.
 
 Carroll Strickland said her 15 year-old son, Allen, who lost his computer
equipment to the FBI, was innocent of tapping into the NASA computers.
 
 She said her son from a friend a list of telephone numbers that "Contained
the number of the computer which we were recently told by the FBI was a
NASA computer, not described as such on the list, of course."
 
 Mrs. Strickland said her son, despite two attempts, never gained access
to the NASA computer.
 
 "As one of the FBI agents told us when he left yesterday, it was obvious
there was nothing malicious in what they did," said Lenora Grumbles, the
mother of the 16 year-old Robert Grumbles. He surrenderd an APPLE ][
computer to the FBI.
 
 Mrs. Grumbles said she was told any evidence the FBI may have found will
be presented to a federal grand jury next month. She said agents also told
her that "they will try to get our equipment back as soon as possible."
 
 Mrs. Grumbles said that she was "thouroughly convinced the children had
no malicious intent. I guess we would have to say that their computer
knowledge exceeds thier maturity."
 
 She said her son "passed all of us in computer know-how years ago."
 
 When he was 13, he and another student developed a video game called
"Doom Vally." which is now being marketted nationally, she said.
 
 "we weren't really sure what he was doing, typing away at that computer
all the time. I guess now we know," Mrs. Grumbles said.
 
 At Marshall, scientists work on general research and managment of the
space program, including work on space shuttles.

 Issue: Master Locks
 
    Have you ever tried to impress your friends by picking one of those Master
combination locks and failed? Well then read on. The Master lock company has
made this kind of lock with a protection scheme. If you pull the handle of it
hard, the knob won't turn. That was their biggest mistake...... Ok, now on to
it.
 
    1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on.
1: The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination),
pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move. 2: While pulling on it
turn the knob to the left until it won't move any more. Then add 5 to this
number. Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.
 
    2nd number. (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times,
then go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st
number once. WHEN you have bypassed. Start pulling the handle and turning it.
It will eventually fall into the groove and lock. While in the groove pull on
it and turn the knob. If it is loose go to the next groove; if it's stiff you
got the second number.
 
    3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers,
then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on it. The lock
will eventually open if you did it right. If can't do it the first time, be
patient, it takes time.

                        Master Lock Picking          12/20/90
 
  Ever see a broken down railroad?  Chances are you have, now a broken down
railroad is the best tool for locker breakings!  I am not saying just take the
dam railroad, but try walking down the tracks and look for a railroad spike.
(Railroad Tire Spike also works)  Once you find the spike then all you need is
a master lock.  (Ever watch those comercials that they shoot a bullet through
the lock?  Hmm.. Makes you wonder.. Send a master lock and a railroad spike to
David Horawitz 'Fight Back')
  After you have the two items then the rest is easy.  Put the Spike in between
the lock part and then just pull down/up.  Kaboom!  There you have an open
master lock.

Issue: Phone Sex
 
      Ever called a phone sex line?  Moaning and groaning of sensual
 pleasures for only 20-45 bucks, and memberships?
 
   The Scandal:
 
      The only way your are going to be able to pull this off is if you
 have call waiting (this is a necessary for the 1st type of phone sex scam),
 or a Voice Mail System (this is easy, but it is harder to get the cards
 out of the perverted ones).
 
 
  Sub-Section #1 : Call Waiting
  -----------------------------
 
  Materials Needed
  ----------------
  A Phone with TONE dialing (that PULSE shit ain't gonna cut it!)
  Call Waiting (of course)
  The number to the BEST phone sex line you can get (live convo's ONLY!)
  A good phreak (unless you live in LA where all the good ones are)
  A good MC/AMEX/VISA card (the sex line must carry all of those)
 
  Setting it up
  -------------
 
       Using one of the cards, advertise in Penthouse Forum, Club, X Rated
 Porn Stars, or any other porno mag that is semi-hardcore and carries the
 sex line ads and card an advertisement.  Have it run for a few weeks
 (send in a picture and shit for the ad, they will tell you all about it).
 You should get a different phone line that can be easily disconnected
 by Ma Bell so the feds don't come a runnin' and the perverts don't keep
 calling back.  When the guys (or girls) call to "have sex", you simply
 answer the phone "Triple X Hardcore Porn Line, may I help you?"  Go for
 a big ass ad in the mag, since you're not paying for it anyway.  Ask for
 the person's credit card type, card #, expiration, bank number, name, etc.
 Don't ask too much personal information, you do not want them to hang up
 on you.  Then after they give you the information, say "please wait".
 Next, dial the >GOOD< porn line and give THEM the information the person
 gave you (act as though you are them).  Just before the chick comes on,
 hit the button and stick the dude online, say "enjoy!"  Don't hang up,
 you will disconnect them (on some phones).  I have also found that if you
 record them, you can exploit it to the maximum (if they are kids, tell
 them to give you all their parents cards or you will send the tape to mommy
 and daddy).  You know have a good card, (if it has enough money on it for
 the line you just called!), go out and have fun.  That is just 1 way to do
 it.
 
  Sub-Section #2 : Voice Mail Systems
  -----------------------------------
 
    Get ahold of a voice mail system, the kind you just dial up and answers
  like an answering machine (the Dragonfire one is 415-227-5618, call it for
  an example).  Set up the message (get your girlfriend to do this, or if
  you are a geek and have a squeaky voice, go for it!) to say something like
  this "Welcummmmm, tooooo Pandora's Hardcore Triple X CUM Again Porn Line,
  Please leave your name, number, credit card type, card number, expiration
  date, bank number, and anything you'd like to talk about.  We will call you
  back in 2 hours.  If this is inconvienent, please hang up and call when it
  is not.  Otherwise, you will be getting the hottest head in LA,SF,Trenton,
  Lubbock, etc. Thank you for calling, mmmmmmmmmmm." BEEP.  This way is a
  piece of shit way since it is so fucken inconvienent.  You would be lucky
  if you got 2-3 cards in a week.  But it's better than nothing.  Remember,
  using this way, you don't do shit!  You do not have to call the guy back.
  You got his card, why give him the merchandise?  Heh.
 
  * Note I would like to state that credit card fraud is a serious offense
  under the constitution of the united states (i forget what amendment,
  but ya know, the one reagan made a year or two back).  I am not liable for
  what you do with this, and I am in no way responsible for your actions with
  voice mail systems and false advertising.  This file is for informational
  and educational purposes only (they all say that!) and should not actually
  be used.  I had a brainstorm,

Issue: A Bug or Not to Bug?
 
 
Detect a Bug???
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
In today's landscape of insider trading, leveraged buyouts and merger mania,
it is no great shock that a new underground industry has developed within
telecom -- eavesdropping.
 
Bugs are cheap (starting at $30) and can be installed in as little as 10
seconds.  And you can bet your bottom $1 million that this expense pales in
comparison to the rewards of finding out your takeover plans, marketing
strategies, and product developments.
 
According to Fritz Lang of Tactical Research Devices (Brewster, NY), there is a
virtual epidemic of bugging going on in the American marketplace.  Counter-
surveillance agencies like TRD have sprung up all over.  They search for
eavesdropping equipment, then notify the client if they're being tapped.  It's
up to the client to respond to the intrusion.
 
Each of TRD's employees is a retired CIA or FBI operative.  Formerly, they
planted bugs for Uncle Sam.  Since it's illegal to plant bugs for anyone else,
these men now engage in counter surveillance work, pinpointing eavesdropping
devices, and sometimes the culprits who put them there, for TRD's client
companies.
 
 
Where Do They Put The Bugs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your TELEPHONE, of course, is a convenient place to install an eavesdropping
device.  But this doesn't mean that the illegal tapping will be limited to your
phone conversations.
 
Electronic phones have microphones which are always "live," even when the
telephone is on-hook.  Stick an amplifier and transmitting unit to the
microphone, and you have constant surveillance of all conversations taking
place in that room, whether or not the phone is off-hook at the time.
 
A device rapidly gaining popularity among today's wire-tappers is a mouthpiece
containing a tiny bug, which looks exactly like the one of your 2500 set.  All
it takes is one trip to the water cooler or the men's room for the insider to
surreptitiously make the old switcheroo.
 
LOUDSPEAKERS are another favorite location for wire-tappers, because they can
pick up conversations when not in use.  Paging systems, piped in music, and
telephone systems all employ some variety of amplifier which the culprit can
use to his advantage.
 
LINE INTERCEPTORS allow eavesdroppers more extensive coverage of your
activities, since they can monitor more than on-line communications from a
single listening post.
 
But really, the number of places you can find a bug is limited only by the
tapper's imagination.  Light switches, plugs, clocks, calculators, legs of
wooden chairs, staplers, ashtrays, the underside of a toilet bowl -- all of
these items have proved fertile territory for the little critters.
 
 
Tools For Finding The Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TRD's people use a patented Surveillance Search Receiver to locate the bugs.
The Receiver uses a broad-band radio spectrum, from 25 kHz to 7 gHz.
 
If there is an unaccounted-for radio frequency emission on the premises, the
Receiver will tune it in on a small spectrum monitor.  It then traces the
emission to its inevitable source, the bug.
 
For room bugs, they also use a Non-Linear Junction Detector, which can pinpoint
all electronic circuit diodes or resistors in the architecture of the building.
 
The Detector emits a high microwave signal into walls, furniture, et al.,
causing any circuit hidden within to oscillate.  As soon as they oscillate,
they become detectable.
 
Mr. Lang clears up a misconception about the Russians bugging our embassy in
Moscow.  "They didn't riddle the building with actual bugs, instead, they
buried millions of little resistors in the concrete."
 
The embassy, therefore, became a hot bed for false alarms.  Whenever the
American counter-measure people came in with their detectors to look for a bug,
they'd pick up oscillation readings from the countless resistors and
capacitors buried in the walls.  Finding any real bugs would be infinitely more
difficult than finding the old needle in a haystack.
 
For finding wire-taps along the phone lines, TRD uses a computerized electronic
Telephone Analyzer.  The unit runs 18 different tests on phone lines between
the CPE block and the Central Office (CO).  Resistance, voltage, and line
balance are just a few of them.  Once they locate a tapped line, they send a
pulse down it with a time-domain reflectometer, which can pinpoint exactly
where in the line the bug has been affixed.
 
Bear in mind that wire-tapping is extremely difficult and time consuming.  As
much as 20 hours of conversations has to be monitored every single business
day.  Because of this, key executives' telephones are usually the only ones
slated for a wire-tap.
 
 
Catching The Culprit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finding a wire-tap is easier than finding the spy who bugged your office.
Direct hardwire taps can be traced to the remote location where the snoop
stores his voltage-activated electronic tape recorder.  After you've found the
monitoring post, it's a matter of hanging around the premises until someone
comes to collect the old tapes and put in fresh ones.
 
As for room bugs, your best bet is to make the device inoperable, without
removing it, and wait for the eavesdropping to come back to fix or replace it.
 
 
Once Is Never Enough
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of TRD's clients have their offices checked monthly, some quarterly.
After the initial sweep, you can have equipment installed on your phone lines
which constantly monitors any funny stuff.
 
As for TRD, they offer a money-back guarantee if they fail to detect an
existing bug on your premises.  Mr. Lang assures us that Fortune 500 company
has been bugged to a greater or lesser extent.  That's how out-of-hand the
problem is getting.
 
Toward the end of our conversation, Mr. Lang pauses.  "So you're really going
to print this, huh?  You're really on the up and up?"  Then he spills the
beans.
 
It turns out Mr. Fritz Lang is really Mr. Frank Jones (he says), a licensed
private investigator with a broad reputation in the industry.  He used the
alias because he suspected I was from a rival counter-measure agency, or worse,
a wire-tapper, trying to infiltrate his operations.
 
Which quite possibly I am.  You can't trust anybody in this spy business.

Issue: Programming ProTerm in your BBS
 
 ProTerm Emulation Docs
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 Introduction:
 ------------
 
 I.  So you want to master the art of making ProTerm Adds, well your in luck
     because you have the best of the best explaining it to you.  Well the docs
     you are about to read will explain how to use the curser control command
     and the repeat command.  Ok well you might get confused when you see
     characters like this (ie. •,,,) in that inversed form.  Well to
     duplicate them you must get into your ProTerm editor and hit
     (control-p, then it will ask you for the character you want)
 
Repeat Command:
--------------
 
 II. The repeat command will make your add ZOOM litterly.  The repeat command
     cuts down time in 2/3 the ammout as if you were to type it out.  Here is
     an example of both
 
  Problem:
     Lets say you want to get 10 "_" across the screen
 
     1. (The Lame way)  __________
     2. (The Fast way)  _*
 
        A. Explaination
          a. The  means repeat. (Wow that was hard) the _ means the character
             you want to repeat, and the * means the ascii character for 10
             (the ascii chart will be explained later)
        B.   How do I get the ascii character?
          a. First deterimine how many times you want the character to repeat
             its self (ie. 10) then add 32 to the given number (ie. 32+10)
             then the given total is 42.  Look up 42 on the ascii chart and
             you will see that the character is a *
 
 Move Command:
 ------------
 
 III.  The move command is pretty easy.  It is similar to the move command.
       The move command saves ALOT of disk space and is easy to program
       one you know how to do it.
 
   Problem:
      Lets say you wanted to move to horozantial 5 (left to right and vertical
      (up and down) 6.
 
      1. (The Lame way) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      2. (The Fast way) •%&"then whatever you want..(ie. a repeat command)
 
         A.  Explaination
               The • command you must have on every move statement.  The rest
               is a little complex.  The % after the • is the ascii character
               for 5, simple enough.  The & is the ascii character for 6. That
               was easy.  So the command •%(horozantial) & (vertical).
 
         B.  How do I get the ascii character?
               Same way as you did before. Take the given character and add
               32 to it for the sum, then look up the sum on the ascii chart
               and then you get your ascii character.
 
  Few Examples:
  ------------
 
   IV.  Here is a quick example of both statements combined to preform
        a function.
 
      Problem:
         You want to make a 22 _'s across the screen on the location, 8
          horozantial and 12 vertical.
 
      Answer:
       •(,_6
 
  Ascii Chart:

                           TV Sports Football         (Turbo Grafx-16)
   The first in a series of great games, Cinemaware introduces TV Sports
Football for the Turbo Grafx-16.  TV Sports Foorball includes everything from a
pre-game show to halftime (featuring marching band) to updates of games from
around the leauge and everything inbetween.  Using the TurboTap, up to five
people can play.  Choose to be a coach or a player in both offensive or
defensive positions, as you tackle our way through the 16 game season into the
playoffs.  What a great was to spend the off season!  Retail Price $49.99
 
                                  Klax                (Turbo Grapfx-16)
   Based on the hit arcade game, Klax is Tengen's first entry for the Turbo
Grafx-16.  Tengen kept this puzzle game true to the arcade counterpart by
including the special bonus points ans warps.  Klax is sure to become a
classic.  Retail Price $45.99
 
                                 Gloden Axe          (Genesis)
  This is Sega's orignal arcade game and has proven a spot in the genesis
library.  In the start of the game you start off by choosing to be either a
Dwarf, Fighter, Girl.  The game has one extra level not present in the arcade
game.   The game is much like the arcade game but the controls are a little off
so you have to line your self up with your enemy.
 
                                Moonwalker           (Genesis)
  This is another Sega orignal arcade game.  The game is different fromn the
arcade game in many ways.  In the arcade game the perspective is a blimp view,
which is nice, but in the genesis version it is a flat picture with litte
effects of 3-D motion.  The game is not much like the arcade so if you like the
arcade game, dont go out and buy this and expect the same.
