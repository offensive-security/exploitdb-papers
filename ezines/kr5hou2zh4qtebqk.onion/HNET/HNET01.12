Below is a logfile of my hack of the DATASTREAM online service on the 9th of
March, 1990.

DATASTREAM is a financial database used by BANKS, BUILDING SOCIETIES, but mainly
by stockbrokers.  Needless to say that much of the information found during this
hack was very confidential indeed (I captured over 300k of data on my hard 
drive).  DATASTREAM is used to store details of clients share portfolios as well
as to provide financial news and analysis for stockbrokers.  I have edited this
logfile so that none of the clients portfolios have been included as I regard 
these as highly confidential and not to be bandied about.
