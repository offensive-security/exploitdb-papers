7:30 EST-10:46Est       - A File By Sk8 The SkinHead-
                        -----------------------------


                             BASIC NETWORKING 

     Well, many people have asked me "how do i use Telenet".."how do i use an 
outdial". Well i have decided to write a very basic file on telenet and how to 
get around on the networks. 

     Well Telenet and others are PSN's or (Packet Switching Networks) these 
nets are connected to many other networks around the world.  You can do alot 
with just basic knowledge that i have (most of you will know this and way 
beyond what i know but some will benefit from it) i will start with some of 
the terms that are often used with these services. 

Access Number- The direct number that you dial to access a network (duh). 

Nua (Network Users Address) - An Nua is basicly a number you type in to access 
that particular service think of an Nua as a phone number sorta its not an 
actually phone number with an Acn country code or whatever because the service 
is connected to the network world wide.  I hope that was fairly clear let me 
show this think of the planet earth as an network and  to reach the services 
on the planet you call the phone number like the service is a persons 
residence or business phone or payphone whatever just like on a network an Nua 
is the Address to a system or outdial whatever on the particular network. I 
hope this is clear or atleast somewhat understood. 

Nui (Network User Identification) - An Nui is like a Account and Password to 
the network like an account and password is to a bbs that lets you access the 
system.  Some people use Nui for like anything like an Vax system Unix systems 
they are referring to an Nui as basicly a account on the particular system 
that lets you use the system. 

DNIC (Data Network Identification Code) - The DNIC is like a 4 digit code that 
represents what Psn it is think of an DNIC like an AreaCode and the Nua the 
individual phone number. 

Outdial - Is basicly what it says an modem port connected somewhere on the 
network that will allow you to dial out from and connect data only to a 
actually phone number not an Nua. 

Pad (Packet Assemble Disassembler) - an x.25 pad is very useful an pad using 
x.25. protocal transmits at 9600 bps to an Nua. This may sound funny but i 
call them "Launch Pads" heh like with an x.25 you can usally access any Nua on 
the planet by usally typing the Dnic+Nua. 



       Now i will explain various things and give helpful ideas. 



     Let me start off with some helpful things for you to try and do. 

                                 TeleNet 

     
     The first thing your going to have to have is your Access number it is 
very easy to get your local access number.  Simply call telenet at 1-800-
TELENET that is thier customer service number and ask for your dialup the 
operator will ask for your area code and prefix of your phone number he/she 
will also ask your baud rate.  There are many telenet ports across the country 
and internationly with varying baud rates from 110 bps (yuck) to 9600 (i wish 
i had) so you will want your maximum baud port most locations have atleast 
1200 many have 2400 and not alot have 9600 ports like for big cities like 
Detroit and Los Angeles at the end of the file i will list some useful 
numbers. Some things to do while online with Telenet and Tymnet.  While at the 
@ on the Telenet system type "mail" or "C mail" or "telemail" or even "c 
telemail" this access's telenets mail system simple entitled "Telemail" from 
there it will ask "user name" or something like that type "phones" next it 
will prompt you "password" enter "phones".  The phones service has alot of 
worthy information it will give you a menu to choose from the rest should be 
self explanatory.  Along with the other information on the phones service 
there is a complete updated list of all Telenet access numbers which is 
conveinent.  Once you have tried the phones service also on telemail enter 
"Intl/Associates" as the user name and "Intl" for the international access 
numbers.  If you are calling from overseas somewhere connect with an telenet 
access number then type this Nua at the telenet @ prompt "311020200142" and 
enter the username and password. You might want to pick up a sort of a 
reference booklet on Telenet simply again call the customer service number and 
ask them for "How to use Telenet's Asychronus Dial Service" and give them your 
address which is self explanatory. Another tidbit of info you would like to 
know if you already didnt know that Telenet is owned by Us Sprint long 
distance service. 




                               Tymnet 

     The same goes for Tymnet service you will first need an Access Number.  
Simply call Tymnet customer service at 1-800-872-7654 and ask them.  Again you 
might like to get Tymnets reference booklet on how to use there system simply 
again ask them to send it to you.  Once online with a Tymnet access number 
type "Information" at the user name prompt and you will be connected to 
another nice thing on tymnet which you have access to all thier Access Numbers 
also just like the "phones" service on Telenet.  Tymnet is owned by "Mcdowell 
Douglas" corporation.  Unlike Telenet where a long distance company owns the 
network.  On Tymnet in the "Information" service there is a very cool option 
that will provide you with all the Dnic's (Networks) available from Tymnet.  
You may also want to get that on buffer but for your conveinience i will 
include a copy of that.  The file "Basic.NetworksII" is the complete listing 
and i would like the Basic.NetworksII file to be accompanied by this file for 
the most part. 
  


                            Outdials 

     Now i will discuss Outdials and tell how to use them.  An Outdial on 
Telenet is an Pcp Port usally.  It will enable you to connect data with a 
carrier.  An Outdial is a modem connected up to the network to access the 
outdial spimply type the outdials Nua.  Usally you will need a Nui or Pad to 
use an Outdial on Telenet just to let you know.  Once connected to an Outdial 
on Telenet type "Ctrl-e" to get into the command mode of the Outdial or if 
your sharp on your Hayes modem AT command set just issue the commands thru the 
Outdial besure to type "Atz" when logged in to reset the modem parameters to 
default values.  Outdials range from different baud rates just like what kind 
of modem is hooked into the Outdial port.  This is the basic Telenet Outdial 
but there are many types a Tymnet Asychronus is a very good Outdial to use 
like i said there are many different types the above is for Telenet Pcp 
Outdials which are used most widely. 


                        Scanning Telenet 


     Well now i will explain how to scan telenet and how to find Pcp outdials 
etc.  When scanning telenet call your Access Number and at the prompt enter 
the Nua.  Plan to scan a certain amount of Nua's in a session wether the 
number is up to you, usally when i scan i scan in blocks of 100 you can find 
alot of things while scanning.  I will tell how to find pcp outdials, first if 
your looking for a particular area code for the outdial take the 313 area code 
for example usally an outdial is in the first 150 numbers scanned so i would 
suggest if scanning for outdials scan like this..the area code for which you 
want the outdial two 0's then a three digit number so the scan would look like 
this...31300001,31300002,31300003 etc.. im sure you get it...along the way you 
will probably find other neat things.  Some things to know when scanning 
telenet is when you enter an Nua and it freezes like wont do anything send a 
break signal, for me i use Proterm for the Apple the break signal is open-
apple b once the break signal is sent it should go back to a @ prompt again.  
If you try scanning another nua directly after you broke out from the frozen 
portion Telenet will give you an error message "Connection Pending" which 
means it is still looking for the Nua system from which you requested 
previously.  To remedy this situation after the break signal is sent type "d" 
for disconnect it will then tell you the connection has been terminated. 
Proceed scanning the Nua continuing where you left off. (Note. you will get 
the freeze and have to repeat the sequence over and over again as of there are 
A LOT of Nuas that freeze) Well i bet your asking "how do i know when ive 
found an outdial?" usally Telenet will respond with a connect message and then 
nothing try to type "Atz" if it responds "ok" then you have a Outdial port 
where as Atz is the hayes modem command for reseting the modems paramaters to 
default settings.  Ok now i will explain some things to look for and some wise 
things to do while scanning and also supply an response key explanations. 
Whenever you "Connected" to an Nua write it down no matter what it is make 
notes of what you find and label them for instance if you encounter any of 
these messages. 
 
   User Name = a Vax System 
   Login = a Unix system 
   Primenet = a prime system 
   Password = something worth noting 

Basicly anything that connects take note of this is very useful for finding 
systems to hack on even though most or all of Telenet has been scanned at one 
time or another there are always somethings to do! that is a FACT!  Be sure to 
write down all "Refused Collect Connection" also because we must not forget 
that when we request an Nua that we are asking for a collect call all Nuas 
inputed on Telenet without an Nui are being paid for by the particlar system 
requested that is why when an Outdials Nua is requested without any sort of 
Pad,Nui etc. it will not excecpt the call in all cases i have encountered 

Here is a list of Network Messages that Telenet will respond with remember 
these are for any type of Telenet access the following may appear and a
