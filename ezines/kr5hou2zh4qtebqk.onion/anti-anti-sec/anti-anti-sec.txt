What you are about to read is the complete destruction of the "Anti-Sec" group. An organization known
as "ProSec" contacted us with reports containing information about the entire group and how it was operating. 
We don't know who they are, they appear to be well-funded and top notch security experts and what
they have done against the group is invaluable to us and others that they have and or would have been targeted. 
ProSec did want me to portray a message that organizations similar to the Anti-Sec will and are currently being
targeted by the movement. ProSec already has access to a number of them and are continuously monitoring and gathering
more information about the various groups and will release information when applicable. No longer should whitehats
fear these groups, as soon as an individual is targeted, they will target right back. This is a warning shot to
those out there that target us. I want to thank ProSec for the work that they continue to do and understand why this 
movement is so important to the security community.

On the 4th of June 2009, a group named "Anti-Sec" decided to expose Astalavista group after 
they successfully exploited what was rumored to be a Litespeed 0day exploit which in reality does not exist. 
After looking up on this more and more, a couple of days later we found out that the responsible 
person behind this attack was a Saudi-Arabian with the nickname RoMeO, so we decided to let the other 
Astalavista staff know about our findings. Joao Pontes, one of the senior Astalavista administrators
decided to warn his friend RoMeO about it and as you will notice below Joao Pontes (rorkty) knew 
from the beginning that Astalavista group was compromised by his closest friend and decided to do nothing about it. 
Later, on the 9th of June one of my dedicated hosting servers, running a couple of websites was targeted 
by the same "Anti-Sec" group providing fake and misleading information to the public.

The reason that we decided to start looking into this subject, was to see how and why my dedicated hosting
server was compromised despite the fact that it was secure enough to provide access to the outside world.

Below is a list of some security measures that had been taken to ensure no unauthorized access permitted:

1) Firewall Protection
2) Brute Force Detection and Prevention
3) Kernel Hardening
4) Apache, PHP, SQL Hardening
5) SSH Hardening
6) Wheel access group for su
7) Chrooted Jail Shell
8) Web Application Firewall
9) Network Intrusion Detection
10) Host Intrustion Detection
11) Hidden daemon versions
12) Rootkit Detection
13) DoS Protection
14) All private sites hosted, audited for bugs
15) Root Access Alert
16) Etc

Unfortunately the interval between compromisation of the server until the alert reports came to our attention
was not enough to prevent the attack.

After our research and the information provided by the ProSec group we came to the conclusion that the server was 
either hit by an 0day exploit or through my dedicated server provider makosolutions.com which later on it shows 
that they were backdoored.

Utilizing passive and active reconnaissance methods resulted to large information acquisitions which provided 
us with means for linking together certain information  and shade more light on who we are about to target and 
research for the attacks that took place under the "Anti-Sec" label.

In this log file you will read a limited version of the information gathered and provided, since the most important 
parts are being kept private in order to be analyzed by the proper authorities.

[2:26am] <~RoMeO> we are sueing you
[2:26am] <~RoMeO> they spoke to glyph
[2:26am] <+RCEg0d> yeah i've seen that
[2:26am] <~RoMeO> admin of irc
[2:26am] <~RoMeO> and:
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> <Eye_SRodd> The reports we have are largely anecdotal, but we believe two users called 'Romeo' and 'Darkpontifex' are behind a recent intrusion
[2:27am] <+RCEg0d> they have no legal right to log or force him to give info
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> but
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> they are still after me
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> and i dont know whos in on it either
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> but i am sure
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> some of my close people online
[2:27am] <~RoMeO> is ratting me out on alot of stuff
[2:28am] <~RoMeO> and i cant do anything until i know whos in on it
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> it doesnt go away like that
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> they are
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> grouping against me now
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> not one or 2
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> like alot of people
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> and groups

// You have no idea, who, where, what and the rest of the 'w's :)

[2:29am] <+RCEg0d> wtf?
[2:29am] <%p3ri0d> don't want to brag for RoMeO but he's one of those that hsould know about it more then anyone else
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> i am not kidding
[2:29am] <%p3ri0d> and shit that's bad
[2:29am] <+RCEg0d> eeye go legal ok...
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> eeye can go legal
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> i dont care about the legal part
[2:29am] <+RCEg0d> the groups?
[2:29am] <~RoMeO> i am more concerned about the people invovled in it
[2:30am] <+RCEg0d> dont worry about the legal shit they can't do a thing
[2:30am] <+RCEg0d> then dont give em information
[2:30am] <~RoMeO> its a little too late
[2:30am] <~RoMeO> plus
[2:30am] <~RoMeO> sopme people
[2:30am] <~RoMeO> i truted for years online
[2:30am] <~RoMeO> are aparently going agasint me now
[2:30am] <~RoMeO> and if they know what i do, they know my operation etc, trhey can do alot of shit against it

// Operation Site Down

[2:31am] <~RoMeO> its some annoying shit honestl
[2:31am] <+RCEg0d> i know how it goes
[2:31am] <~RoMeO> all started on bhf today
[2:31am] <+RCEg0d> the thing is.. you are too worried and u might end up doing a mistake
[2:31am] <+RCEg0d> so first you need to relax and take things from the begining
[2:32am] <~RoMeO> i understand if they are pissed off that i damanged there shit or w/e, but those people whom i trusted going asgainst me, thats bad
[2:32am] <+RCEg0d> take out of your operations people you might suspect that they are plotting against u
[2:32am] <~RoMeO> already out
[2:32am] <~RoMeO> but i dont wanan just
[2:32am] <~RoMeO> deluser
[2:32am] <~RoMeO> i wanna be 100%  sure
[2:32am] <~RoMeO> they are plotting agaisnt me

[2:34am] <~RoMeO> or what i do
[2:34am] <~RoMeO> they can just shut it down
[2:34am] <~RoMeO> i have no idea why they think they can do that,but thats the case
[2:35am] <+RCEg0d> keep your shit private and monitor everything
[2:35am] <~RoMeO> everything i know of, is already monitored
[2:35am] <+RCEg0d> if they want to shut you down trust me they will find a way
[2:35am] <~RoMeO> thst how i know of it in the first plae
[2:36am] <+RCEg0d> find out who they are

I am glad you like the articles section :) , what about the code base tho? any comments on that maybe?

and hm, I have A levels ( GCSE ) exams atm, after that the new release of DMZ will start, and the main 
prios to improve are:

- Layout
- Submit sytem + articles / codes system.

all the articles and codes will be reformated to look at its best, etc....

@intimidat0r, I sure will :)

# DMZ PHP.Virus, very simple PHP virus, that would do the following:
# |1| Look for all PHP files in directory.
# |2| Check if infected.
# |3| Infect with your backdoor.
# |4| Log all infected files, and optional mail them to you.
# root@darkmindz.com~ exit

# [ To-Do ] #
# Mass infector, infect other users on server.
# Better Reports, some system info reports too.
# Spreading, by RFI dorks.
# Polymorphism //Arxidia!
#[x] Change user-agent used, 2 backdoors, `include and a CMD exec`. - done a better job here, one backdoor, includes all that :]

// Careful not to infect yourself.. There is a polymorphic flu virus on the loose that spreads through RFI..

09:05 [Glyph(Glyph@mods.govsec.org)] might want to be more selective.. your 0day is starting to become apparent with each g0troot
09:06 -pand!- Irssi: Starting query in bhf with Glyph
09:07 (RoMeO) wat
09:07 (Glyph) Need to be more 'selective' 
09:07 (Glyph) two of two ... tsk, tsk, tsk..
09:07 (RoMeO) you need to explain more, and why do you think i wrote 'g0troot' or ever used it 
09:07 (Glyph) If you keep up with that, everyone is gonna now where to look.
09:08 (RoMeO) and where did you see me use it? lol 
// Everywhere..

09:08 (Glyph) Doesn't what distro, when there's another 'common element' 
// OpenSSH <= 4.3

09:08 (Glyph) Just saying need to be more circumspect.
09:08 (Glyph) Not saying 'you'..
09:09 (RoMeO) okay :]
09:09 (Glyph) But I know you'll get w1rd to those responsible.
09:09 (Glyph) Capice?
09:09 (RoMeO) will do
09:09 (Glyph) If the 'perps' keep it up, it won't be a 0day now will it?
09:10 (RoMeO) ofcourse, but again... i am pretty sure you dont know where to look and if you look hard you will see 'g0troot' only used once in public
09:10 (RoMeO) so i dont know what do you mean by 'need to stop using it' sicne it was only used once from what i read
09:11 (Glyph) Rightio.
09:11 (Glyph) two out of two 
09:11 (Glyph) Both had a common element.
09:11 (RoMeO) which is
09:11 (Glyph) Besides being shitty about 'security'
09:11 (Glyph) For pay type product.
09:12 (RoMeO) yeah
09:12 (RoMeO) the targetted people are publicized
09:12 (RoMeO) they are the people that say they are security experts while they dont really qualify to be your average noob
09:12 (RoMeO) the people who publish exploits
09:13 (RoMeO) people who make money out of free stuff, related to 'security' etc
09:13 (Glyph) lol.. not yesterday's demo ;)
09:13 (RoMeO) yesterday was just to prove something to dark
09:13 (RoMeO) he didnt say a word after that
09:13 (Glyph) Aye.. but .....
09:13 (Glyph) tipped the scales in my favour.
09:14 (Glyph) The more it gets done, the more likely it is the 0day is exposed.
09:14 (RoMeO) ofcourse
09:14 (Glyph) Now.. that does NOT mean that all that have the product haven't alreay been 'had'
09:14 (Glyph) But it does lead to disclosure.
09:15 (Glyph) 'Even a blind pig finds an acorn every now and then'
09:15 (RoMeO) sure, i understand
09:15 (Glyph) And InfoSec isn't st00pid like Dark seems to think. 
// Really ?

09:15 (RoMeO) i never underestimate anyone
09:15 (RoMeO) thats my rule 

09:16 (Glyph) If I can already see 'glimpses', you can bet others out there can as well.
09:17 (RoMeO) let them see it, antisec got more tricks up the sleeves ;p
09:17  -> Glyph chuckles
09:17 (Glyph) I'm well aware of that.
09:17 (Glyph) But don't ya just hate losing 'weaponized' shit for a lark?
09:18 (Glyph) Put that arrow back in yer quiver.. might be really useful sometime down the road.
09:18 (RoMeO) yeah, i understand you, and again it was just to prove something to someone... nothing was left behind, those 'acts' rarely ever happen
09:19 (Glyph) Thing is.. WTF did you need to prove any damn thing to Dark?
09:19 (Glyph) Scratch that.. change pronouns to third person ;)
09:19 (RoMeO) its between me and him ;p
09:19 (RoMeO) he talks alot
09:21 (Glyph) You know I log the publics?
09:21 (RoMeO) i assume alot do

09:22 (RoMeO) i just hope you dont log privates

09:37 (RoMeO) so your job is basically... ?
09:40 (Glyph) Coordinator, IT Research and Special Projects.. in a 2 year college
09:40 (RoMeO) nice, well i will bbl
09:41 (Glyph) Ciao.. and yes that's enough info to figure out who I am.
09:41 (RoMeO) haha

14:21 (Glyph) Aye.
14:22 (Glyph) Don't take the stuff I spin in channel to heart.
14:22 (RoMeO) :)
14:22 (Glyph) I'm interested in debating with Dark.
14:22 (RoMeO) yeah i saw
14:22 (Glyph) Plus it may actually spark some interest in the subject.
14:22 (RoMeO) but again, all he does is talk
14:22 (RoMeO) so what i did when i first met him was
14:22 (RoMeO) to shut him up
14:23 (RoMeO) i put him up on a challenge
14:23 (Glyph) It's a topic that every individual needs to make a decision about.
14:23 (RoMeO) we made some random guy on irc to post a random security site
14:23 (RoMeO) and the challenge was who gets access to it first
14:23 (RoMeO) i got in
14:23 (RoMeO) he didnt
14:23 (RoMeO) but he kept on arguing
14:23 (RoMeO) about how he got vulns on it, but its 'way over my league' rofl
14:24 (Glyph) You know what that sounds like to me?
14:24 (RoMeO) what
14:24 (Glyph) 'tempest in a teacup'
14:24 (RoMeO) lol
14:24 (Glyph) Notice he braced me in channel..
14:24 (Glyph) right.
14:24 (RoMeO) right
14:24 (Glyph) 'When did you stop beating your wife sir?'
14:25 (RoMeO) lol.
14:25 (Glyph) HE should be presuming that everyone has 'skillz' and can whoop his arse.
14:25 (RoMeO) he is all about talk, and its not like he just started this, no no, apparently he been around since 2000 and doing the -same- ever since
14:26 (Glyph) hmmm... I've been around a lot longer than that.
14:26 (RoMeO) yea, just saying its not like he does that here only or just now
14:26 (Glyph) Course I can plead ignorance.. not aware of a lot
14:26 (Glyph) Leopard isn't likely to change its spots
14:27 (RoMeO) haha
14:28 (RoMeO) webdevil knows alot about him too, he was there when he got kicked in his lil challenge
14:28 (RoMeO) and he didnt come back to the channel for a long long time after that
14:29 (Glyph) I presume you have an account at gso
14:29 (RoMeO) i dont know honestly
14:29 (RoMeO) but if ther was, it would be RoMeO

17:35 [Dark(~Administr@EclipticX-85D523E2.hlrn.qwest.net)] Wheres newtype hang these days?
17:35 [Dark(~Administr@EclipticX-85D523E2.hlrn.qwest.net)] Its been so long since I've talked with her
17:35 -pand!- Irssi: Starting query in bhf with Dark
17:36 (RoMeO) we just met on rizon
17:36 (RoMeO) for a small chat
17:36 (Dark) Word
17:36 (Dark) Can I safely assume she's all up in -antisec?
17:36 (Dark) In lieu of recent Astalavista incident?
17:38 (Dark) Well
17:38 (Dark) If you see her around again
17:38 (Dark) Tell her Dark says hi
17:38 (Dark) And thanks for everything
17:38 (RoMeO) what do yoou mean -antisec
17:38 (RoMeO) and willl do
17:39 (Dark) I mean
17:39 (Dark) She's probably restarting her actions
17:39 (Dark) In zfo and whatnot
17:39 (Dark) Just an assumption
17:39 (RoMeO) i dont know really, but she really liked the latest antisec movement
17:39 (RoMeO) actions etc
17:39 (Dark) Good to hear
17:39 (RoMeO) ^^
17:40 (Dark) Along time ago she said she had a ICMP exploit for IOS
17:40 (Dark) I may attempt to locate her and coax it out of her
17:40 (Dark) Seeing as she's probably not using it anymore
17:40 (RoMeO) yea, she is out of all this for now
17:40 (RoMeO) too busy and whatnot
17:40 (Dark) Haha
17:41 (Dark) She's majoring in CompSci yea?
17:41 (RoMeO) yes ;\
17:41 (Dark) Eh
17:41 (RoMeO) i hate CS
17:41 (Dark) Shoulda known
17:41 (Dark) Same
17:41 (RoMeO) too broad
17:41 (Dark) Fucking Linguistics + Econ for great justice
17:41 (RoMeO) java is gay
17:42 (Dark) To be honest, I haven't seen alot of the oldschool people for a really long time
17:42 (RoMeO) yeah
17:42 (Dark) Theres a few left here and there
17:42 (RoMeO) everyone gets busy for some time
17:42 (Dark) I wish they'd pop up
17:42 (RoMeO) but they all come back eventually
17:42 (Dark) I guess making a new antisec is where its gotta be
17:42 (RoMeO) i hope anyways
17:43 (Dark) I think defcon should go over well
17:43 (RoMeO) yes, new movement and just wait for people to join from diff communities
17:43 (Dark) After that
17:43 (Dark) As I see it
17:43 (Dark) Its all out war
17:43 (RoMeO) rawr
17:43 (Dark) So start saving your exploits nao
17:43 (RoMeO) hidden in sekret boxen ;O
17:44 (Dark) For sure
17:44 (RoMeO) lcirc is being monitored now
17:44 (RoMeO) they host  #milw0rm and #bottalk
17:44 (Dark) Probably
17:45 (RoMeO) no like. i know for sure
17:45 (Dark) Monitored by pr0jekt types, or by the feds?
17:45 (RoMeO) pr0ject types
17:45 (Dark) I figured as much
17:45 (RoMeO) and feds ofcourse, but pr0ject types got the root shell
17:46 (Dark) You know what the intentions are?
17:46 (RoMeO) take down after exposure
17:46 (RoMeO) intel, private messages, passwords, mail spools, then rm -rf
17:46 (Dark) can't say I've ever really been to lcirc
17:46 (RoMeO) should get them all to stop
17:47 (Dark) Owning milw0rm is a reasonable priority
17:47 (Dark) As well as Secfocus of course
17:47 (RoMeO) it is in the right hands
17:47 (RoMeO) :]
17:47 (Dark) I've been trying to go rogue on some stuff
17:47 (Dark) I'm not part of any group per se now that
17:48 (RoMeO) neither ami
17:48 (RoMeO) doing it on my own
17:48 (RoMeO) i function better solo

09:24 [{Glyph_Home}(~glyph@mods.govsec.org)] btw, unless it's been you whacking GSO, the technique is becoming widespread.
09:25 -INFO- Irssi: Starting query in bhf with {Glyph_Home}
09:25 (RoMeO) mm?
09:28 (RoMeO) what are you talking about lol
09:29 ({Glyph_Home}) GSO has had issues this past week.
09:29 ({Glyph_Home}) I thought perhaps you were the reason.
09:29 (RoMeO) because  rsnake released a DoS tool
09:29 (RoMeO) nope
09:29 ({Glyph_Home}) No.. the litespeed issue
09:29 (RoMeO) my issues dont go on lagging web servers
09:30 ({Glyph_Home}) Though I have no idea why you'd nail GSO
09:30 ({Glyph_Home}) Doesn't seem to be your 'venue'
09:30 (RoMeO) that too
09:31 ({Glyph_Home}) I've already talked with Edu and WebDevil..
09:31 (RoMeO) about
09:31 ({Glyph_Home}) Gonna make my  'recommends' to the admins this week.
09:31 (RoMeO) i find it funny how staff at 'black hat forums'  get to be staff at ' gov sec' 
09:32 ({Glyph_Home}) Quesion: Any tips on 'mitigating' the /g0troot issue?
09:32  -> {Glyph_Home} chuckles
09:32 ({Glyph_Home}) Not exactly a 'whitehat' myself.
09:32 (RoMeO) lolol
09:32 ({Glyph_Home}) I just don't 'participate' in the darkside anymore.
09:33 (RoMeO) just keep the site clean, didnt see gso being mentioned anywhere as a target, ever
09:33 (RoMeO) so all good
09:33 ({Glyph_Home}) Used to..

09:33 (RoMeO) but people who are going down soon are botnet communities for example 
09:34 ({Glyph_Home}) hmmm... Sounds like a shadowserver operation.
09:34 (RoMeO) just cleaning the net
09:34 ({Glyph_Home}) Straight out of the 'toyshop'
09:34 (RoMeO) :]
09:35 ({Glyph_Home}) Antisec is beginning to sound more like 'cybercops' 
09:36 (RoMeO) haha

09:36 (RoMeO) wont be done under antisec 
09:36 (RoMeO) antisec is kept for 'security' issues 
09:36 (RoMeO) this is, botnet and skids crap

09:36 ({Glyph_Home}) hmmm... 
09:37 ({Glyph_Home}) IFF I can be of assistance, without endangering current position, I offer my not so hot skill sets.
09:37 (RoMeO) all good so far
09:37 (RoMeO) lcirc and indoirc got comprimised
09:37 (RoMeO) the 2 largest botnet and ccpower ircd's
09:38 ({Glyph_Home}) w00f
09:38 (RoMeO) ;)
09:38 ({Glyph_Home}) Might be an idea for the info to make it back to the ccproviders.. discretely and anonymously of course.
09:38 (RoMeO) well
09:38 (RoMeO) the idea is
09:39 (RoMeO) to release all intel and ip's on the people who started those channels / irc's
09:39 (RoMeO) out in the public and all over the net
09:39 (RoMeO) let the authorities deal with that
09:39 ({Glyph_Home}) roflmao
09:39 (RoMeO) :]
09:39 (RoMeO) brb

16:15 (Glyph) ?
16:15 (Glyph) Oh.. that stuff
16:15 (Glyph) Old stuff.. was playing more or less.
16:16 (Glyph) Course my 'playtime' tends to lead to profitability ;)
16:16 (Glyph) All that is at least five years old or older.
16:16 (Glyph) circa 2005
16:17 (RoMeO) yeah
16:17 (RoMeO) thinking of setting up a box for dark
16:17 (RoMeO) see what is he going to do
16:17 (RoMeO) ofcourse everything will be patched to log in's and out's // HOOKIN.. HOOKOUT.. 
16:18 (Glyph) Well you know the saying.. friends close, enemies closer ;)
16:18 (RoMeO) yeah
16:18 (RoMeO) sure do
16:18 (Glyph) Can't believe spike threw error's like that, and that's what he recommended?
16:18 (RoMeO) lol
16:19 (RoMeO) thats why i want to see what is he goign to do on a box
16:19 (RoMeO) anyone can talk
16:19 (RoMeO) specially on the internet
16:19 (Glyph) I'm beginning to think he 'talk's a good game'..
16:19 (Glyph) snap!
16:19 (RoMeO) :P
16:19 (RoMeO) thats what i heared from everyone so far
16:19 (RoMeO) i will even give him a none chrooted shell
16:19 (Glyph) Have you lost your mind?
16:19 (RoMeO) lol
16:19 (Glyph) Damn if I'd trust him that far.
16:20 (RoMeO) it will be an empty box
16:20 (Glyph) jailed, maybe.. unjailed never.
16:20 (RoMeO) and every shell is modified to log to a remote system
16:20 (Glyph) Now yer sounding like me.
16:20 (RoMeO) i will sit there wth a cop of tea and tail -f
16:21 (Glyph) tail -f firewall | grep 'insert key phrase of the day here' 
16:28 (RoMeO) reading stories about knuth
16:28 (RoMeO) how to own a continent for example
16:28 (RoMeO) that one is amazing
16:29 (Glyph) It's NOT hard.
16:29 (RoMeO) if you didnt read it, you should
16:38 (RoMeO) i was looking around dark for a while
16:38 (RoMeO) and what surprised me is
16:38 (RoMeO) his really low-quality passwords
16:38 (RoMeO) like
16:38 (RoMeO) 123123
16:38 (RoMeO) or 123pass
16:38 (RoMeO) etc
16:38 (RoMeO) made me go ?
16:39 (Glyph) almost as bad as qwerty12345
16:39 (RoMeO) yes
16:40 (RoMeO) just one more thing that shows he is talk-only
16:40 (RoMeO) okay he can argue that he doesnt 'reuse passwords'  but using really weak passwords -does- mean something
16:40 (Glyph) worse yet.. he could be a c&p
16:40 (RoMeO) that would be so bad
16:43 (Glyph) Yeah.. it would.
16:44 (Glyph) Actually, I sometimes think you and he are one in same and are playing 'mindfuck' with me.
16:44 (RoMeO) hahaa
16:44 (RoMeO) why would we tho
16:45 (Glyph) Because you were bored with the brainless fucks we normally encounter.
16:46 (RoMeO) when that happens i just log on a shell and explore ;p
16:46 (RoMeO) one more thing
16:46 (RoMeO) dark is a yahoo user
16:46 (RoMeO) that counts 
16:47 (RoMeO) thats -100 sec points
16:47 (RoMeO) i do tag people by there email s too
16:47 (RoMeO) for example
16:47 (RoMeO) yahoo users,  mostly newbies / females
16:48 (RoMeO) hotmail users, same thing but a higher level a small higher level
16:48 (RoMeO) gmail users are on top and above that comes the people with there own mail servers 
16:48 (RoMeO) its alot deeper than that, but thats just a quick explanation :P
16:50 (RoMeO) found 2 passwords of dark in my db
16:50 (RoMeO) and they both fail
16:50 (RoMeO) hellohello is one of them -_-'

17:20 (RoMeO) 15:23:42 (Glyph) Apache/2.2.11 (FreeBSD)
17:20 (RoMeO) 15:24:33 (Glyph) Johnny_Demonik
17:20 (RoMeO) 15:27:48 (Glyph) ERROR: Database error.
17:20 (Glyph) Ahhh...
17:21 (Glyph) He came up out of 64.127.41.18
17:22 (RoMeO) ah
17:22 (Glyph) That ip is apparently a 'shell' anyhow there's port 9050 on it.
17:22 (Glyph) But it goes back to WestVirginia..
17:22 (RoMeO) yeah
17:23 (Glyph) Firm called Compucrash
17:23 (Glyph) Their webserver is at .3 of that range.
17:23 (RoMeO) alrit, lets just hope he comes back here, busy with another hack ;p
17:23 (Glyph) So silly me, I tried to access their ircd thru their webpage.
17:23 (RoMeO) lol
17:24 (Glyph) That's when the MySQL threw the error code at me.
17:24 (Glyph) Then I checked the forums.
17:24 (Glyph) You wouldn't believe it.. PHPBB3
17:24 (Glyph) Pr0nsters have already been at it.
17:24 (RoMeO) lmao
17:24 (RoMeO) yea
17:25 (RoMeO) i saw that one
17:25 (Glyph) Not heavily.. but that's prolly because it's 'under the radar'
17:25 (Glyph) Plus the bw is pricey as heck.
17:26 (Glyph) I'm heading home..
17:26 (Glyph) You have a good un.
17:26 (RoMeO) thanks
17:26 (RoMeO) enjoy

Darkmindz.com was just another "haxor" AKA idiot breeding ground forum run by
the infamous saudi named RoMeO. Fortunetly due to the recent events RoMeO
decided to kill his site and handle because he was sloppy & cocky enough to link
his anti-sec activities with his public internet "life". This has spared us the
trouble of needing to rm -rf /* his shit, so thx RoMeO, hope we can be friends.
We didn't want a good hax.log to go to waste so we decided to publish darkmindz
anyways.

RoMeO is a blackhat wannabe and gave us good lulz with astalavista, props to
that, but who the fuck is/was ssanz anyway and what's the point of spreading
anti-sec propaganda via imageshack? You can't enjoy the benefits of a blackhat
and run some retarded haxor forum at the same time pal, good to see that you
realized that. But in any case if you decide to put your shitty forum online
again, you will be rm'ed.

Here's what we found in darkmindz land.
