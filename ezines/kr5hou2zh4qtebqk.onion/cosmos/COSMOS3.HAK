Each time the transaction is ready for a new input, it will      respond with and underscore "_" at the beginning of the new line.  This      indicates that the preceding line is correct.      If an error does occur, the transaction will respond with an error      message and prompt for correction.  When an error occurs, you have      4 choices.      1.  Re-enter the entire field correctly.      2.  Enter line-feed to ignore, (checks rest of line)      3.  Enter a ";" to disregard the present circuit.      4.  Enter a "." the transaction will disregard all input, and exit.    H-LINE inputs.   --------------      H-LINE input for the service order trio SOE/CSA/TSA is being rigidlydefined in 8.0 according to three categories.  These categorys containfundamentally different types of order/facility information.     Category 1: ORD, OT, DD, FDD,J OC, DT, SG, EO, LC     Category 2: US, FEA, CCF, CAT, BTN, SS, AO, RZ, FR, GP/CG, CTX/CG/MG/NNX,                 LDN, RTI.     Category 3: FW, RW     Category 1 items are primary, once defined they cannot be changed                by conflicting category 2, and 3 lines.                         SERVICE ORDER TRANSACTIONS   Transaction         Definition   ===========      ======================   SOE              Service Order Input   TDZ              Telephone Number Assignment lists   LDZ              Line Equipment Assignment list   SOH              Service Order withheld   SOM              Service Order Modification   SOC              Service Order Cancellation   SOW              Service Order Withdraw   SCM              Service Order Completion by MDF   SCP              Service Order Completion by PAO   SCA              Service Order Completion - Automatic   SCF              Service Order Completion for MDF automatic   SCI              Spare Cable pair inquiry   CDD              Change Due Date   BAI              Bridge Lifter Assignment Inquiry   LAI              Line Equipment Assignment Inquiry   NAI              Telephone Numbers Assignment Inquiry   TAI              Tie pair assignment Inquiry   EDZ              Facility Emergency Assignment list for backup   MAP              Manual Assignment Parameters   MAL              Manual Assignment list   TSW              Total Service Order Withdraw                   ***************************************                           TRANSACTIONS DEFINED                   ***************************************SOE - Service Order Establishment    - Establishes a pending service order.  The types of orders are; NC, CD,      CH, F, T, SS, RS, R, RF.  Reassociations are treated as change orders.    - H-lines must contain ORD, DD, and OT.  Optional facilities; FW, RW, FDD      AO, FR, SG, and either DT or OC.    - I and O lines may contain; US, FEA, CP, OE, TN, RZ, NNX, PL, TP, TK, BL, #     SE, CON, MR, BTN, RC, RE, RT,STC, STN, STO, CCF, LCC, and RTI.    - ESS orders requiring coordination by the recent change input center may  #    be flagged with an input of "RW C".Example of a NC [New Connect]WC% SOEH ORD NCXXXXXX/DD 01-01-86/OT NC/FDD 02-05-86/DT AM_I CP XXXXX-XXXXXX/OE ?/TN ?/US 2FR/FEA RNNL_.Example of a CD [Complete Disconnect]WC% SOEH ORD CDXXXXXX/DD 01-01-85/OT CD_O TN 534-1822_.Example of a CH [Change]WC% SOEH ORD CHXXXXX/OT CH/DD 01-01-86/TN 534-1822_O TN 534-1822/STN CO_I TN ?_.Example of SS [Suspension]WC% SOEH ORD SSXXXXX/OT SS/DD 01-01-86_O TN 534-1822/SS SB_.TDZ - Telephone Number Assignments List    - List the indicated number of spare directory numbers for a NNX code, and      directory number type.    - Up to 25 directory numbers can be specified, using the prefix LC.ExampleWC% TDZH NNX 534/TT G/LC 7    (LC can be up to 25).Output example would look similar to this.**EMERGENCY FACILITY ASSIGNMENT LIST 01-01-86  RESERVED LINE EQUIPMENT**NO SPARE LINE EQUIPMENT FOUND  AVAILABLE DIRECTORY NUMBERS (7)534-XXXX534-XXXX, etc.**TRANSACTION COMPLETEDSOW - Service Order Withdraw    - Withdraws most recent version of a service order    - Order number must refer to the latest version.  The H-line circuit ID      identifys the order.  Valid circuit identifiers are; TN, XN, PL, CP, OE,      and TK.ExampleWC% SOWH ORD NC-XXXXX/TN 534-1822.SCP - Service Order Completion by PAO    - Record in the Service Order File the completion of an order by PAO    - Standard SXX H line input.ExampleWC% H ord CDXXXXXX/TN 534-1822.SCA - Service Order Completion Automatic    - Enters final completion on all service orders which have been or are      not requried to be completed by the MDF, are not in a held, or jeopardy      status, and are due prior to or on the current date.    - Two due dates may be entered on the H-line; SCA will complete orders due #     on or between the dates.  Additional options are OT (order type), ORD,      and SG.ExampleWC% SCA.          :complete all orders on or before this due dateExample2WC%SCAH DD 01-01-86/OT NC     :Complete all NC (new connect) orders.CDD - Change Due Date    - Change due date of a service or frame order    - I think an example will suffice;WC% CDDH ORD CH-XXXXXX/TN 534-1822I DD 01-01-86.output example**ORD CH-XXXXX  DUE DATE 01-01-86NAI - Telephone Number Assignment Inquiry    - Provides from 1 to 25 spare telephone numbers compatable with the      input specifications.    - Input is an H-line with the TN type and NNX or RZ entries. The status of      the TN supplied will be modified to reserved if ST is specified on the H-#     line.ExampleWC% NAIH TT X/NNX 534/ST RS.this shows first available spare in prefix 534.MAP - Manual Assignment Parameter    - Permits the PAO to establish the parameters that will constitute the PAO #     Open-of-Day report.WC% MAPI NNX 534/ECS 1R/EQF TNNL/LC 50, etc.   (for line equipment)I NNX 534/TT B/LC 10  (For Telephone numbers of type B, 10)etc.    ==============================================================     [C]OPYRIGHT 1986.
