EDIB^HTORIAL
by mikael cardell

Another editorial from the closet? Yes, but this one will be rather
short and my only contribution to this issue. I'll be back in coming
issues, but this particular one collides with a lot of things in Real
Life. Perhaps the birth of our child will be within deadline? If so,
you'll be seeing a little announcement shouting out that I'm a proud
father!

So, besides increasing the population of this crowded planet, what's
mikael up to? I hope you'll notice with the publication of th spunk
press manifesto in this issue. This is what my friend and co-editor
Chuck, myself, Ian Heavens of UK and the holder of anarchy-list, Jack
Jansen will be doing; publishing and distributing alternative
literature in electronic form.

My personal wish is that spunk press will establish a relation with
the Free Access Foundation (FAF) so we can give the blessings of the
net to even more potential readers by establishing free access sites
all over the world. I hope I'll be able to do just this myself as soon
as I get my *grumble, grumble* computers working allright.

I'm also trying to establish contacts with sysops of public access
BBS's to encourage them to carry spunk press material as well as
e-literature from Project Gutenberg and the Online Book Initative. I
would like to see these BBS's as the new (electronic) libraries that,
instead of lending you a book, gives it to you.  Get in touch if
you're a sysop.

Well, get in touch anyway -- we do like feedback, sometimes. I'm out
of here. See you around...

Editorial from the U.S.
State of Anarchy 1993
by Chuck

Another year has passed, a year that saw the international anarchist movement 
continue to grow.  I'm very optimistic about the coming year and the prospects 
for more anarchy for the rest of this millenium.  Last year saw the growth and 
appearance of many new zine and anarchist projects.  It also included many 
changes and probably the natural demise of several projects.  A successful 
gathering was held in the Fall in Bloomington, Indiana and I heard that 
another was held in southern California.  One anarchist activist was harassed 
by the Feds when he made anti-Bush remarks on the Internet.  Anti-convention 
demos were held in New York and Houston.  Anarchy continued to blossom on the 
Internet, the worldwide electronic networks of networks.  One of the projects 
that was created on and will be available on the Internet is announced 
elsewhere in this issue.
While some envious critics, who obviously wear blinders, continue to herald 
the death of the anarchist movement, the facts consistently belie their 
observations.  As the anarchist movement enters 1993, it's probably as strong 
as it was in the early part of this century.  There are thousands of anarchist 
activists around the world who are organizing, publishing, building and doing 
all kinds of things.  I certainly find it hard to keep up with all the 
anarchist literature that I get in the mail.  Interest in anarchy is higher 
than it's been in a long time.  I talk to folks in other cities and they tell 
me about all the people who show up at their local meetings.  They're having 
to beat them off with a stick!  Locally in Madison, attempts at building a 
local group and scene have been moderately successful.  The number of 
consistent attendees at our local meetings haven't been high, but there 
obviously are many self-identified anarchists and anti-authoritarians around.  
The problem is, of course, getting them motivated and organized.
So, what is on this anarchist's mind as we enter 1993?  Unity.  I'd like to 
see the North American anarchist movement cooperate more.  I'm not asking for 
or looking for one big continental anarchist network or organization.  Calls 
for such things are foolish.  A big network already exists, only it doesn't 
have a name and doesn't need one.  I'd like to see more tolerance and 
cooperation among the diverse anarchist groups, networks, and projects.  I'd 
like too see fewer nasty put downs of other anarchists for not being 
"anarchist" enough.  Sure, criticism is still needed and useful, but the 
rumors and name-calling need to stop.  All anarchists should not be alike--
that is the strength of diversity and diversity is part of the anarchist 
vision.  We need to tolerate our differences better.  Some of us are going to 
do more "violent" direct action than others.  Some of us choose to be 
nonviolent.  And we don't have to choose one way or another.  Tactics and 
lifestyles and approaches and tendencies can be part of a spectrum and they 
can be complementary.
We need to get beyond thinking in terms of "correct" anarchist options.  If we 
expect an anarchist society to be open-minded, let's be open-minded ourselves.  
Who do I support?  I support Anarchy magazine in Columbia and its wonderful 
obtuseness at times.  I support the Wind Chill project in Chicago and their 
militant attitude.  I support the folks at Social Anarchism and their 
scholarly approach.  I support the Love & Rage network and its growing pains 
(looks like they are starting to decentralize more).  I support Dreamtime 
Village.  I support the Anarchist Youth Federation.  I support Bob Black and 
his wonderful rants.  I support John Zerzan and his writings, even if they 
give me artist's block.  I support the punk attitude of the folks at Second 
Guess zine in Nevaduh.  Hooray for the Emma Center and the great attitude of 
Profane Existence.  Life without the folks in Bloomington would be like life 
without pizza.  I support Large Larry in San Francisco.  Three cheers for the 
folks at Autonomedia and their great books.  I support the Meander Whatever-
Its-Name-Is-Now and those who espouse nonviolent anarchy.  Go Fifth Estate Go-
-Beat State!  I support...many others which space limits who I can include.
Let's keep those activists on their toes who might become complacent now "that 
Clinton is in office."  One activist friend has talked to me about the drop-
off in participation in her progressive group since November.  Hey folks, 
Clinton isn't going to change the things that need to be changed, but hey, 
maybe I'm preaching to the converted.  Anarchists need to be vocal in their 
criticisms of Clinton and his new cronies.  We also should point out to those 
fascists who'd want to join us in this that their system is no better.  It's 
business as usual for the American empire and this will become all too clear 
for more and more people over the next couple of years.
In 1993, let's fight those who would keep us marginalized, whether they be the 
state, the CEOs, the Left, or those within our own movement.  Hey kids, I want 
to see anarchy everywhere.  It's more than just some alternative hobby or 
clothing option.  I want to see it gain mainstream acceptance.  I don't want 
to have to explain what it is anymore.  I want to see a time when there is no 
need anymore for anarchist activists.  I want anarchy and I want it--now!
Let's see more anarchist cooperation in 1993.  We are, after all, supposed to 
be cooperative!

Sundiata Acoli's Coming Up For Parole

     After 20 long, hard years, Sundiata Acoli, ex-Black Panther,
is coming up for parole in early 1993. Because of his outstanding
achievements, New Jersey Department of Corrections recently
restored all of the "good time" they had taken from him during the
early 70's; which made him immediately eligble for parole. Yet the
parole board plans to give him a 10 year "hit", meaning, "Do 10
more years!" We are asking all people concerned about justice to
write the parole board today, demanding that Sundiata be released
when he comes up for parole. Send personal and form letters and
signature petitions to:

The New Jersey State Parole Board
CN-862
Trenton, NJ
08625 USA
(609) 292 4257

Also send a copy of your letter or petition to:

Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign
P.O. Box 5538, Manhattanville Station
Harlem, NY
10027 USA
(203) 966 9048

This will help his attorney, Jill Soffiyah Elijah, (718) 575 4460
(Work); (718) 575 4478 (FAX); (718) 282 3576 (Home), verify to the
parole board that the letters and petitions were sent.

A Bit Of History About Sundiata

     In 1973, Sundiata and Assata Shakur were captured after a
shoot-out on the New Jersey Turnpike during which their companion
Zayd Shakur and a state trooper, Werner Foerster, were killed.
     Following a highly publicized trial, Sundiata was convicted
and sentenced to life at Trenton State Prison. There he was
confined for 5 years in a MCU isolation cell which was smaller then
the SPCA's space requirement for a 90 lb. German Shepherd dog. He
was then secretly transferred over 1,000 miles to the infamous
Federal Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois, although he had no
federal charges or convictions. An entrance physical exam showed
that Sundiata had been heavily exposed to tuberculosis while he was
at Trenton Prison. Even so, for the next 8 years at Marion, he was
confined 23 hours per day in an isolation cell containing only a
stone bed, toilet bowl and sink. Finally in 1987, Sundiata was
transferred to general population at Leavenworth Federal
Penitentiary, Kansas.
     Sundiata has had only one minor disciplinary infraction in the
last 10 years. At Leavenworth he has maintained a straight "A"
average in all his college courses while earning diplomas in both
Desktop Computers and Paralegal Real Estate Law. He has also
received "above average" job-performance ratings and he has worked
7 days per week for the last 5 years as a cellblock janitor.
     Because of his outstanding record, the New Jersey Department
of Corrections recently restored the 2.5 years of "good time" he
had lost while confined in Trenton's MCU Unit; which made him
immediately eligible for parole. Yet the New Jersey Parole Board
plans to "hit" him with 10 more years when he comes up for parole.
For Sundiata, already 56 years old and infected with tuberculosis,
that will amount to a death sentence. Write the parole board today,
and demand that Sundiata be released at his paole hearing.

Harmful Matter#2
PO Box 3642, Terre Haute, IN 47803
This funny anarchist zine is a gas!  I haven't laughed this hard while reading 
a zine since the old days of Popular Reality.  The detourned turkey / 
Thanksgiving graphic on the back cover is worth more than winning the fuckin 
lottery.  Features in this issue include pieces on bisexuality,  being fat in 
today's society, rewritten punk versions of the pledge of allegiance, album 
cover reviews, and a rport from my friend Joseph on the wonderful anarchist 
revolution in Bloomington, Indiana.  Definitely worth checking out.  [Trade, 
two stamps, or 50 cents]

Instead of A Magazinev.11, no.55-56
PO Box 76 * Shingletown, CA 96088
This issue's theme is "higher education" and the problems with it.  Also read 
about editor Michael Ziesing's impending relocation to SE Asia.

Ship of FoolsJuly / September 1992
PO Box 2062, Westmister, MD 21158
Kif is hopefully free of government shenanigans now and has managed to put out 
this excellent zine.  If he keeps putting this one out, it has all the 
potential to become a sort of Utne Reader for anarchists.  We all know that 
Utne sucks, but Kif's zine features excerpts from the anarchist press (another 
zine like this is SLAM).  Read more about how the feds seized the Davis 
family's computers after delivering a bogus UPS package containing pot.  Great 
coverage of radical news.  Check out the pro-hemp stuff, news about cops, 
anti-racist organizing,  political prisoner updates, zine reviews, and the 
piece on t-shirts for cops which celebrate polic brutality.  Highly 
recommended. [$2]

Imminent Strike #4
504 W. 24th #81, Austin, TX 78705
Anarchist zine from Texas.  Articles on nomadism, anarcho-tribalism, and

Incite Informationv.3, no.6 / January-February 1993
1507 E. Franklin St. #530, Chapel hill, NC 27514
A fine anarcho-libertarian zine from North Carolina.  This issue includes 
scads of letters, an essay on the new Clinton administration, a piece on the

today's zines.  [$10/six issues]

folks are also apparently active on the Internet.

Kick It Over#30
PO Box 5811, Station A, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5W 1P2
This issue's focus is on elections with a Canadian flavor.  Readers of 
Practical Anarchy know that the last issue of this zine talked about 
elections.  I'm burned out on this issue, but this issue of KIO offers some 
more views.  Anarchists should protest all elections, not just the ones where 
national leaders are chosen.  Several great anti-election graphics here.  Be 
sure to check out the articles on the SDS, the college peace movement, and the 
news brief sections and resource reviews.  KIO is looking better all the time.  
The new collective deserves your support. [Canada: $9/4 issues.  U.S.: $9/4

Chick-full of articles on everything of interest to anarchists.  One of the 
most exciting projects in the U.S. today. [Trades, $1.50 / 1 issue, $8 / 6 
issues

Rolling StoneFebruary 4, 1993
Oh, brother.  This glossy waste of paper discovers the DIY music scene and 
Riots Grrrls in this issue.  Of course, they do a very half-assed job of it 
too.  The article on the 7 inch scene mostly covers what big labels are doing 
to capture this "market segment."  The author concludes with a reassurance 
that the 7" phenomenon is only a temporary one and that soon it will be U2 as 
usual.  RS also reviews two Riot Grrls bands and one male reviewer dismisses 
Bikini Kill as more "Sabbath-like" noise.  Oh yes, check out the special 
Marlboro catalog pull-out and  the slick Calvin Klein, Guess, Ford and Polo 
ads.  Give me MRR any day of the week.

Vomit Blood#3
PO Box 65072, St. Paul, MN 55165-0072
Anarcho-punk zine which celebrates the DIY attitude.  Poetry, punx and

uncensored personal ads.  [Quarterly. $10 / issue.  Tabloid. 72pp]

An illustrated look on what it is like to be a "fat" woman in today's Cindy 
Crawford society.  Personal account is very moving.  Highly recommended. [2

SPUNK PRESS MANIFESTO

      @

     S P U N K  P R E S S    

The excuse for the existence of SPUNK PRESS is the desire of some
individuals to see alternative literature continue to flourish, but
this time online!

The policy of SPUNK PRESS is to act as an independent publisher of
works converted to, or produced in, electronic format and to spread
them as far as possible on the Internet and in the BBS society free of
charge. The work may not necessarily originate from someone with net
access. The major interest of SPUNK PRESS is alternative literature
and anarchist material, both old, converted, and newly produced.

We want to help zine editors, flypost authors and others who desire a
wider audience to convert or to produce their works in an electronic
format and give them the opportunity to use our distribution channels,
FTP sites, mailing lists and whatever other means we might have within
our powers.

We welcome fanzines, pamphlets, books and portions of books, articles,
manifestos, quotations, interviews, bibliographies, reviews, posters,
and other material, both in-print and out-of-print. 

You can snarf what we have published so far from:
  red.css.itd.umich.edu (IP Number: 141.211.182.91)
  /poli/Spunk/texts

This manifesto and other internal Spunk Press documents can be found in
/poli/Spunk/info; in particular, there is an introduction to the archive
in /poli/Spunk/info/Introduction.  To submit material, get the file 
/poli/Spunk/info/How.To.Submit from the FTP site mentioned above or contact 
the editorial collective.

If you do not have ftp access, you can get documents by sending electronic
mail requests to a mail server (such as ftpserv@lysator.liu.se).  Type "help"
in the body of the message for instructions to change and list directories,
and retrieve files from the archive.

To get on our mailing list send a note to

  spunk-list-request@lysator.liu.se

so you can be a part of the coordination of actions taken. 

The mailing list is the forum for decision making at SPUNK PRESS, but
if there is no clear consensus, or the consensus is at variance with
anarchist ideas, the collective decides.

The collective is composed of people with a reasonable commitment to
doing some aspect of the work at SPUNK PRESS, and will be extended to
those who are like-minded.

Boycott & Buycott
by Chuck0
The next issue of PA will have more on why anarchists should actvely oppose 
capitalism.

Boycott:
Colorado:  Last November, the majority of voters in this state approved a 
Constitutional Amendment which "overturned all of their state's Gay and 
Lesbian rights ordinances and banned the passage of any more such ordinances."  
Several groups have called for boycotts of the state until this amendment is 
thrown out.  Some steps you can take to support the boycott:

*  Urge any organizations or professional associations that you belong to to 
not schedule any meetings, events, or conventions there.  As a member of the 
American Library Association I will lobby it to not have any conventions there 
in the future (the ALA will probably do this anyway).  If you are a SF fan, or 
professional or member of a special interest organization, you should do the 
same.

Other suggestions from the Wisconsin Light:
*  Do not vacation in Colorado.  Do not be part of any convention or group 
meeting in the state.
*  Do not buy any product made in or distributed from Colorado.  This, of 
course, includes Coors beer (a notorius backer of right-wing causes), but 
there are numerous other products as well.  When you're shopping, look at the 
labels on cans and packages.  They will say where they come from.  If it's 
Colorado, choose some other brand.
*  Write a letter to the mayor of Colorado Springs [the home base of CFV, the

ZENDIK FARM
From: wixer!cactus.org!hogbbs.scol.pa.us!wce@cs.utexas.edu (Bill Eichman)

To the autopia list--

This is a post that I wrote for another "cyber community" oriented list-- 
I repost it here, without corrections or improvements, to add to Paco's 
writing about the Zendiks.

Starting with landbased communities, perhaps located at the ocean's edge, 
seems a logical step towards a seacolony effort....

==========================================================================

Hello, Folks,                                       April 28, 1992

This past weekend I spent some time talking with Arol Wulf and three
other members of the Zendik Farm, a community that has been mentioned in
other letters here in this mailist.

I first heard about Zendik farm some 4-5 years ago, when one of the
people on my network passed on to me a package of Zendik literature and
a copy of a videotape, "Arol Wulf Raps", distributed by this community.

Some month's ago my beloved gave the videotape of Arol Wulf to some of the
women who were organizing the Earth Day celebration at Penn State
University-- and these women decided to spend some university funds
earmarked for Earth Day to bring Arol Wulf here and have her speak.
I guess because I am a person of some prestige in the ecology activism
groups here at PSU, when the time came it seemed to fall naturally on
my shoulders to take Arol and her friends out for dinner afterwards, and
I ended up being able to "interview" the visiting Zendiks for quite a
few hours, over a period of two days.

So, I'm going to try to encapsulate some of my impressions here, and
bounce them around to folks. Maybe it will stimulate some
possiblilities.

ZENDIK FARM ECOLIBRIUM FOUNDATION
---------------------------------

What is Zendik Farm and the Zendick Farm Ecolibrium Foundation?

Zendik farm is a 21-year old intentional community of artists,
craftspeople, and organic farmers. We offer apprenticeship programs to
youth from all over the world. These young people live at this drug-free
community and can learn any art or craft, organic farming techniques,
as well as learning how to build alternative living structures and work
with appropriate technology. They also learn the art of cooperation
within a working alternative social structure.

Recently Zendik Farm has begun to work on amending the constitution
with an ecological Bill of Rights. We've contacted scientists,
activists, and artists throughout the United States to help us draft
this amendment. We feel the validity of this proposal is undeniable and
have found support from many of these people.

The Zendik Farm Ecoloibrium Foundation is dedicated to the
sustainability of the human species through the promotion,
demonstration, and practice of the socio/political philosophy known as
ecolibrium. Ecolibrium's central premise is taking responsibility on a
holistic level, i.e., socially, ecologically, and politically. The
foundation works from this open-ended philosophy as the viable
alternative to the oncoming extinction of the human species. Therefore,
Zrendik farm's primary function is to teach and help others practice
this democratic, ecology-based, and cooperative social structure.

The Zendik Farm Ecolibrium Foundation is committed to the survival and
well-being of all species and to the purity of the elements that sustain
life. A fundamental truth of our time is, that without a dramatic
change from the competitive consumer society to an ecological and
cooperative society, humanity will cease to exist. The technical
knowledge exists right now to heal our earth. Zendik Farm's work is to
pursue and live out the cultural philosophy that can implement this
knowledge. We communicate through numerous artforms such as literature,
music, theatre, dance, and video; and we work to make life Art itself.

We wish to work with as many individuals and groups as our time and
energy allows. We believe in cooperation, not competition. We believe
humans everywhere can get together and create a benevolent, pleasurable
culture.

                        WHAT IS ZENDIK FARM?

Zendik Farm is a cooperative community of artists, activists, and
organic farmes started 22 years ago by Arol and Wulf Zendik as a refuge
for artists and musicians to work out of the city and free of
conventional resraints. Over the years and through many changes, Zendik
farm has evolved into a radical movement for social and ecological
change. Through opur techniques and way of life we are building a strong
new culture based on honesty, cooperation, creativity, and universal
responsibility. Since our founding in 1969 we have drawn people from
aroundf the world. The group is constantly being infused with new blood,
mostly youth from the ages of 15-25, who are fed up with the way the
world is being ripped off and ruined.

Zendik Farm is a 300-acre certified organic farm outside of Austin,
Texas where we build and design our own housing, do our own mechanics,
and grow our own food without pesticides. We also raise animals, dairy
goats, horses, ducks, chickens, peacocks, geese, and a few dairy cows.
The community is intensely artistic; we do theatre, tattooing,
publishing, pottery, metalwork, music, video, fashion, amd dance, just
to name a few.

The Zendik farm zeen is the largest and most widely distributed
underground mag in the world. It covers the Zendik philosophical and
political stance on everything from ecology and sexuality to
literature, art, and science, and the occult. We distribute it around
the country ourselves at 'select' street corners, college campuses,
health food stores, and supermarkets. We survive financially from
donations brought in by our mag-zeen, music tapes and donations from our
apprentceship program. Our TV shows are run in series on Access cable
stations in cities around the world, such as Austin, San Francisco,
Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis, Boulder, and in England.

At this point in history, as humanity continues it's devastation of
nature, we realize it is our responsibility to change. Change ourselves
and everything before it is to late for us as well as all other life on
this planet. We believe that ecology is our only true religion, Truth
the only valid pursuit, and cooperation the only workable social ideal.
It's too late for everything else.

Zendik farm offers short and long term apprenticeships to people who are
looking for a responsible, funky alternative to the drudgery of life in
the DeathKultur. Apprenticeship tuition is on a sliding scale based on
individual situations and length of stay; we can also arrange for school
credit.

Ix, Nom, or Nez.

************************************************************************

For all intents and purposes, Zendik Farm is a classic counterculture
commune. It has 45 members on a 300 acre farm in texas-- though, two
years ago, they were just making the move from their third farm, a 75
acre place in southern california. The members live in a relatively
intense communal style, six to a room in a rambling old farmhouse,
awaiting the construction of more living cabins which are being
constructed now, and several of which will be comnpleted by the fall.
For all their crowding, the people I talked to-- Arol Wulf, a 53-year
old woman and one of the defacto leaders of the community, Shey, a 23
year old woman, Zoe, a 20 year old man, and Geb, a 19 year old man,
seemed very happy with what was happening at the farm. They all
handled themselves very well, extremely well considering their 30 hour
drive and the nervewracking nature of coming to a strange town to give a
speech and distribute t-shirts and publications.

The Zendiks promote a distinct "Back-to-the-land" and local reliance
approach to communities, but they include computers and information
technology in their concept of community. Their magazine is
dtp'd/produced with a fairly hefty donated Macintosh system, and the
magazine (also called "Zendik Farm") is the primary income source for
the community. They claim to print 50,000 issues every quarter, and
that theirs is the largest-circulation alternative magazine published
in the world.

Apparently they're relative newcomers to the net. They've recently
gotten an Econet account, but while they vaguely knew that lower cost and
broadly based nets like internet and usenet, etc, etc, existed, and that
they should know more about them, not much had been done to get
connected. (Of course, they've only been in texas a short while, less
than two years, and are 35 miles out in the boondocks of Austin, and
probably had to worry about getting their farm going far more than about
being gabby on the networks...;-}. )  They didn't have their new Econet
ddress available when they talked with me-- maybe I'll be able to get
it sooner or later.

They're also pretty concentrated on farming the land, which is
supposedly certified organic ( The only way I can figure that is if the
Texas organic certification system is more lenient than the Cal or Pa
certfication, though maybe the fact that the farm was unoccupied for
seven years was factored in...). They're raising animals, many of which
they brought from Ca., and seem to have the classic grain and bean diet
with vegetables, eggs, milk from goats and newly-bartered-for cows, and
occasional meat from their fowl and purchases from neighboring farmers.
(When asked about aquaculture, they claimed to be planning to set up
systems after housing is built.) At least some of their income is
obtained through selling organic grain and nuts (from trees already on
the property) to natural foods stores in California.

They print and dye T-shirts, some of which are pretty fine if you're
into the tie-dye look. They've definitely got some fairly handy black
and white line-drawing artists doing designs for shirts, magazine illos,
and book and tape covers. They publish six or eight small press books,
none of which I got the chance to read. (some seemed to be poetry, some
philosophy.) They have enough of a recording studio to produce a
half-dozen tapes (none of which I listened to...), and maintain a band
which, through playing clubs and events and making tapes, is another
major source of Zendik income. They produce occasional videos of the
talking head or recorded speech sort, and Arol Wulf appears on a public
access cable show that Zendik produces.

This makes for a pretty complete media blitz, all things considered;-).

Well, I'm getting tired here-- I'll mail this and maybe write some more
in a few days....

Later, Bill

ps Rural texas has no building codes, they say. The IRS has never bothered
them, and by living at below poverty line incomes they pretty much don't
pay taxes (I wonder about social security?).

alt.amateur-comp Charter
 
     Alt.amateur-comp is a conference where readers
and writers can discuss the articles and subjects that appear in 
the electronic and printed newsletter "The Amateur Computerist".  
The Amateur Computerist was born out of the battle to continue 
computer programming classes for workers at the Ford Rouge 
Factory in Dearborn, MI after Ford and UAW officials ended the 
classes in February 1987. In our first issue we wrote: "There
was an effort by administrators of the UAW-Ford program at the 
Dearborn Engine Plant to kill interest in computers and computer 
programming. We want to keep interest alive because computers are 
the future." ("Introduction", vol I, no. 1)
 
     The first issue of the newsletter was published February 11,
1988 and dedicated to the Flint sitdown pioneers who began the 
UAW. Articles have appeared in the newsletter from some of those 
pioneers who welcomed the newsletter and the computer, saying,
"From the Great Wall to the Great Pyramid, from the hieroglypics 
to the screen of the computer, mankind is still
progressing." ("Dawn of a New Era", vol I, no. 1)
The sitdowner pioneers who built the UAW believed that the 
problems of automation had still to be solved by the upcoming 
generation.   
 
     The newsletter is dedicated to support for grassroots 
efforts and movements like the "computers for the people 
movement" that gave birth to the personal computer in the
1970's and 1980's. Hard efforts of many people over hundreds
of years led to the production of a working computer in the
1940's and then a personal computer that people could afford in
the 1970's. This history has been serialized in several issues of
the newsletter.
 
     Most recently the newsletter has begun an online edition that is
available free. We are beginning to document the progressive
impact of democratic developments like usenet news and the 
internet and we plan to have a supplement dedicated to these 
developments.
 
     The Amateur Computerist was described by Andrew Ross and 
Constance Pawley in their recent book "Technoculture" (Univ of 
Minnesota Press, 1991, p. 125) as follows:

 
     "When worker education classes in computer programming were
     discontinued by management at the Ford Rouge Plant in 
     Dearborn, Michigan, United Auto Workers members began to 
     publish a newsletter called the 'Amateur Computerist' to
     fill the gap. Among the columnists and correspondents in 
     the magazine have been veterans of the Flint sit-down strikes
     who see a clear historical continuity between the problem of
     labor organization in the thirties and the problem of 
     automation and deskilling today. Workers' computer literacy 
     is seen as essential not only to the demystification of the 
     computer and the reskilling of workers, but also to labor's 
     capacity to intervene in decisions about new technologies 
     that might result in shorter hours and thus in `work
     efficiency' rather than worker efficiency."
 
     The newsgroup will also make available the electronic 
version of the Amateur Computerist when a new issue is published.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
  One of the reasons for proposing this group is that there is
currently no place on usenet that we know of where issues involving
computers and workers are dealt with.

INTRODUCTION TO THE WOBBLIES


THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD (I.W.W.)

Every worker is an industrial worker, whether that industry be
steel, health care, tourism or education.  If you earn your living
by working with you hands or mind, then you're welcome to join
the I.W.W.

The Wobblies (as members of the I.W.W. are known) have historically
organized those workers that the A.F.L. had shunned.  In the early
days that meant blacks, immigrants, women and unskilled laborers.
Today we find the I.W.W. organizing office workers, environmental
canvassers, housewives and prisoners, as well as the homeless and
unemployed.

Can the I.W.W. help me improve the working conditions or wages at
my current job?

That depends on you.  The I.W.W. does not provide an all-knowing
leadership or hefty treasury to fight your battles for you.  But
if you're willing to organize on the job-site by talking with
your co-workers about the issues that matter to them, then you
can count on your fellow workers in the I.W.W. to lend their full
support to your struggle.

In 1909, when Wobblies in Spokane were being thrown in jail for
speaking on street corners, hundreds more came west on boxcars
to help them.  In the first of a series of "Free Speech Fights",
Wobblies took turns speaking and being arrested, packing the
jails and courts, until they won the right to speak in public.  It's
their fierce commitment to social justice that makes "worker
solidarity" in the I.W.W. a force to be reckoned with.

What is the relationship of the I.W.W. and mainstream labor unions?

For many decades, the leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has worked
hand in hand with the capitalists to squelch rank and file
militancy.  Their overriding concern has been "industrial harmony,"
not social justice, and so they fail to question the most basic
assumptions of capitalist production.

While regular trade unions split workers up into their respetive
skills, allowing one craft union to cross the picketline of another,
the I.W.W. believes in one big union, organized along industrial
lines.  If, for instance, the nurses go on strike, they should
be able to count on the support of the doctors, janitors,
pharmacists, and clerical workers in their hospital.

Many Wobblies also belong to trade unions where they work.  Here
they often agitate for more rank and file democracy.  The I.W.W.
does not believe in signing away the right to strike, nor does
it recognize the authority of the courts to impose injunctions
against labor.  While the I.W.W. is happy to do strike support
for other unions when necessary, we also try to keep our sights
on the bigger prize ahead.

But didn't the I.W.W. die out?  Are its ideas still relevant?


The I.W.W. was nearly crushed in the early '20's by some of the
fiercest repression ever unleashed by big business and the U.S.
government.  Because the I.W.W. had strongholds in industries
that were critical to the First World War effort, and because
they refused to sign no-strike pledges, the Wobblies were
branded "pro-Kaiser" and relentlessly persecuted.

The world economy has changed a lot since the days when the I.W.W.
controlled great sections of the logging, mining and agricultural
industries.  Today, while mainstream labor tries desperately
to hold its ground against the union-busting fostered during the
Reagan/Bush era, vast new sectors of the economy have opened up
that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would never dream of organizing.

Whether they be fast-fod workers, word processors, or micro-
chip assemblers, today's non-union wage workers need the I.W.W.
even more than their predecessors.  Winning the eight-hour day
was not enough.  We must redefine the very meaning of work
itself, and find ways to redistribute society's wealth for
the benefit of all.

Does the I.W.W. support any political party?

The I.W.W. is a labor union, not a political party.  We believe
that economic justice must be achieved through economic struggle,
whether it be with our boss or landlord.  The institutions of
government have always proven themselves to be the allies of
capital, so we do not wait for our freedom from wage-slavery to
be legislated.

The I.W.W. has successfully resisted attempts by various "left"
parties to make the union a mere adjunct to their political
ambitions.  By refusing to endorse one party or another, the
I.W.W. has avoided the sectarian feuding that can easily destroy
a group.

Nonetheless, many of the founders of the I.W.W. were also active
in socialist politics.  Eugene Debs and Big Bill Haywood are the
best-known examples.  Some Wobblies consider themselves anarchists
and shun all electoral activity.  Others are simply militant
unionists who would disavow all labels.  Our commitment to
worker control and the abolition of capitalism makes us a "left"
organization more by default than intention.

What is direct action?

The labor movement has been most successful when it relied on the
direct intervention of the the workers to obtain their demands.
Rather than allowing professional negotiators to speak for them,
Wobblies have engaged in those tactics which they could control
themselves--strikes, slow downs, work to rule--what we call
sabotage.

Sabotage in this context does not mean arson and dynamite.  It's
more properly defined as, "the conscious withdrawal of efficiency."
Staying at your workstation but reducing your production by half
will bring the bosses to their knees quicker than a whole team of
negotiators.

The I.W.W. has never advocated violence.  By fighting for justice
with non-violent tactics, the I.W.W. has often won the support of an
initially mistrustful public.

What is a general strike?

A general strike is when all workers in all industries go on strike
at the same time.  It may be for a limited time and have limited
demands, in which case it has the largely symbolic value of
illustrating the important point that the world doesn't function
without the workers' cooperation or indeed, their labor.

THE GENERAL STRIKE, however, is a mythological, revolutionary moment
in the future when all the workers of the world seize control of
their respective industries, and begin reorganizning their
workplaces to to meet their own needs rather than those of their
bosses.  Needless to say, it will take a well educated and highly
organized working class to pull this off, and it's toward this end
that eh I.W.W. dedicates itself.

What about feminism and the I.W.W.?

Women have been active in the I.W.W. since its inception.  Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn, one of the I.W.W.'s best known early agitators, once
said that, "The I.W.W. has been accused of pushing the women to the
front.  The is not true.  Rather, the women have not been kept in
back, and so they have naturally moved to the front."

Much of the work that has traditionally been done by women was not
recognized as such by the male-run business unions.  The I.W.W.
supports the right of homemakers, sex-industry workers, and other
women to organize for better conditions and wages just like other
male workers.

What about the I.W.W. and militarism?

Every war has its losers and winners, but countries have nothing to
do with it.  The ruling class inevitably makes a tidy profit from
war, while the working class loses its flesh and blood on the
frontlines.  Worker solidarity does not recognize national
boundaries, but instead unites against a common class enemy.  The
surest way to stop a war is by refusing to participate in it, which
is why the I.W.W. believes it's important to educate workers in the
armed forces and so-called "defense industries" about where their
real self-interest lies.

How about the environment?

Rainforest destruction, chemical spills, and acid rain are just a
few examples of how dangerous it can be to put profit before people.
Government regulation and public outcry can at best slow down
regulation and public outcry can at best slow down the destruction
of our planet, not reverse it.

But if the workers in all polluting industries were to withdraw
their labor, the poison factories could be shut down in a matter of
weeks.  The workers themselves must decide whether what they produce
is socially useful and necessary or not.

So, why not become a Wobbly?

I want to become a Wobbly.  I'am a worker and not an employer.

Will computers conserve or change the social structure?
by Jesper Hogstrom <jay1@hb.se>
   Boras Radikala Autonoma

To examine this deep enough, I would have to define and explain what
a social structure is in general, and specifically how such a
structure is applicable on our own society. Time will not permit a too
long discussion on this, why I can give only my own point of view.


The social structure in a capitalist/liberal society like ours bases
itself on money. The more money controlled by an object, the higher
rank the object gets. This is valid for a lot of different objects
such as persons, groups of persons/families, companies and even
countries. Money comes from money but also from information, or
controll of information. Without going too far into this definition as
it would take me away from and beyond the scope of the question I'll
just tell you what you already know:


* Computers can gather information.
* Computers can evaluate massive amounts of information very rapidly.
* The more powerful a computer is, the fastar can it work and the
  higher is the price.


This seems to reserve the power a computer can give to but a chosen
few. This group ought to be a rich group as computer power is
expensive. As money and power often comes in pair, this group is not
only a rich group, but also a powerful group. What they have gained by
the computers is more power giving the result they are now more
powerful than before.


Power is always something binare, i.e. it is operated by something on
something else. Using this definition on the earlier mentioned scene
we find an increased polarization. The already powerful groups gains
more power on behalf of the weak groups.


Now, let's stop for a moment to see who made what mistake.

* Developers of technology:
  They might have acted in beleif they made what was best for
  mankind. Naive, but not morally wrong in either consequentialism
  nor deontology.


* The people who cannot afford the new technology:
  As they didn't do anything, it might at a first glance seem as if
  they are innocent, and maybe they are, if in-action/inactivity is
  right. But is it?


  All week long they work and they strive
  and when the weekend comes, they are more dead than alive.


  For what purpose? To maximize happiness on the planet? Probably not
  - they have helped maintain a system that createws unhappiness, so
  in a utilitarian point of view they are acting wrongly.


  A deontologist might say they worked because of duty, or a sense of
  duty. Duty yes, but mainly to save themselves from thinking, and
  duty to an immoral system. Sounds wrong to me. There is never an
  excuse not to make a revolution.


* The capitalists/capital owners:
  As they benefit personally from all this, one might think they are
  wrong. And they are. They have not helped increase the overall
  happiness, but maintained an evil system.


  Have they worked in self-interest? Yes. The conclusion must be they
  are wrong.


The consequenses of all this will lead to a quantity change in power
distribution. The rich will get richer, the poor poorer. As time
passes the weak groups (of persons, countries et cetera) will feel
more and more out of touch with society. The society ruled by the rich
and powerful will no longer concern them. Adding a few other factors
this might eventually lead to a quality change in the social
structure. This is the real computer revolution. This will overthor
what is here today and hopefully, but unfortunately not necessary lead
to a new and better society.


This creates another interesting problem - who was acting morally
right if the earlier mentioned conclusions were correct? Well, as
deontologists don't care about the consequenses of actions, the
judgements based on that theory remains the same.


The utilitarians, however, must judge from the results or
consequenses of the actions. If the post-revolution society is better
for all and gives a net increase of happiness, the actions that lead
to the revolution were good. They were bad before the revolution and
turned good after.


This makes at least me sceptic to whether or not the utilitarian
theory is any good in practice.


Before going into trends of today, I'll just sum up the discussion so
far:
* The technical development increases the polarization in society
  regarding power-not power, rich poor et cetera.

* The technical development is conserving the social structure until
  the tensions become over-whelming (and overthrowing).

* The exploited will still be exploited until the revolution.


The trends of today.
In the macro perspective the scenario described is already happening.
The rich and powerful organisations buy themselves more power and more
information through computers. Power used to oppress the poor and weak
organisations keeping them from developing a higher standard.


In the micro perspective, computers are available to more people,
giving a distribution of potential power. Mind you, however, that
owning a computer is still reserved for those who already belong to
the rich 20 per cent of the world. When starving, you don't wastre
money buying a computer. Having no access to electricity you don't buy
a computer.


Also, a computer without sufficient information is as powerful as any
other tool, let's say a screwdriver... Not very powerful.


The problem as I see it is that any given society, with extremely few
exceptions, is trying to maintain and conserve itself. The system of
today is based on exploitation and a gap between rich and poor. The
technical evolution will be directed by those who have power, and they
will direct it in their preferred direction. Inevitably this will
worsen the situiation.


As last words, I would like to quote the famous singer Bob Marley:
It takes a revolution to find a solution.

dear editor,
I was very impressed with my first issue of "practical anarchy on-line",
which i received on dec 15.  i can see that the e-mail format has a lot
of potential.  I'd like to introduce myself, and share a few thoughts with
your other readers.  my name is ed stamm, i'm a thirty-two year old moderate
anarchist, employed at the university of kansas as a payroll clerk.  I'm
married and have a two year old daughter.  I belong to a tiny green group
here in lawrence, and am active in a traditional and very weak labor union
where i work.

i would like to see anarchists concentrate on creating the new society among
themselves instead of expending our energy trying to convert society as a
whole.  i think practical projects will attract more converts than words 
alone.

next, i would argue that we should avoid antagonizing the rest of society when
we are building our new community or communities.  squatting, violent protest,
and anti-social acts like graffitti and postering will not only give people
a false impression of anarchism, but it will also attract unwanted attention
from the authorities.  maybe i am getting old, but it really seems to me that
building a community is the best long-term strategy.  If fascists come to
power, at least we will be organized.

the biggest problem i have with recruiting new anarchists is the association
many people have of anarchism with violence, and their idea that anarchism
is the same thing as chaos.  i have to know someone pretty well before i
will even mention to them that i am an anarchist.  once we do something
positive though, i would be proud to admit my political opinions to
anyone.  I could say, yes i belong to a housing cooperative.  it's an
anarchist project where we cut our housing expenses by taking the
profit out housing costs.  Yes there is a computer cooperative i belong
to that is sponsored by anarchists who want to cut costs by sharing
equipment and who want to make the net accessible to more people.  there
are so many possibilities!  tools, books, babysitting, food, gardens!
