EDITORIAL #1
by cardell

Welcome to the second issue of P@ ONLINE! I hope you'll cope with the
fact that this issue is rather thinner than the first one but that,
dear reader, is largely up to you. Write to us!

OK, I admit it, I haven't been that active writing articles myself,
but I've got so much going right now. I'm trying to get some
cooperation going between several anarchistic groups, zines and
newspapers for sharing of information and news. If all goes well the
news section in the November issue will be a whole lot larger.

A socialistic computer user group has shown interest in our zine as
well and I hope they will be interested in the cooperation too. They
will at least distribute the zine among their members, which is a Good
Thing to start with. 

I'm writing this in front of a Facit terminal connected to the
computers at Lysator via modem, but I hope I'll be able to do all my
editorial work at home soon. I'll be setting up a BBS as well as soon
I get my computers running. The BBS will, of course, have the latest
issue of P@ ONLINE along with a lot of other nice ezines. I'll let you
know what happens.

EDITORIAL #2
What's going on in the States?
by Chuck

Summer is rapidly ending here in Wisconsin and this year will probably
be remembered as the year without a summer.  The corn never got very
big and it never got very hot.  Looks like it might be a long winter,
but that's OK because it means more reading, more anarchy, and more
writing getting done.

While the summer never heated up, the local anarchist scene
certainly did.  In June, Andrew Wertheimer and I convened the
first meeting of "some madison anarchists" at the public library.
Our first meeting attracted around 15 people and about 3 of those
are still involved.  We've been meeting weekly at a local deli and
have been having lots of good discussion.  Currently we have
a core group of around 5-10 people.  We have probably had
twenty or more different people at our meetings this summer
and there are a lot more out there.  We are having a picnic on the
lawn of the Capitol this weekend and are hoping for a good turnout.
We've also been working on various projects such as a room/space
of our own to be known as the "anarchist resource center."
It looked liked this project would come to fruition, but will have
to be delayed for as much as a half year.  Meanwhile, we've
found a local bookstore that is willing to allow us to meet there and
store our stuff there.  I'm pretty excited about the whole thing.

The anarchist movement is certainly growing in the U.S. as many
of you can tell, but what does Chuck have on his mind of late?
Elections, right-wing evangelicals, and finding a job.  By the end
of the year we should know how much of a threat the resurgent
right-wing evangelical movement is going to be.  If appears that
these folks will not refrain from interfering in other people's lives,
I will make the main project of Practical Anarchy [Wisconsin]
an anti-evangelical campaign.  The goal will be to disrupt and
 discredit their groups before they suceed in taking over local
muncipal and state governments in the U.S. and start passing
laws hostile to freedom.  I'm also debating whether or not I
should participate in the elections this November.  My forthcoming
edition of Practical Anarchy will have articles devoted to
this dilemma.  As an anarchist, I don't think we should
legitimize the State any more than we have to, but are there
issues which are good cases for anarchist participation in elections?
I don't know.  In this country, the pressing areas of concern are
a women's right to abortion and gay and lesbian rights.  That's
right, those of you reading this in other countries, the real issues
like the environment, the steamroller of capitalism, and militarism
aren't even addressed in the campaigns [and we are on the defensive
on abortion and gay/lesbian rights.]

I'm an optimist.  I'm encouraged by the rapidly growing anarchist
movement.  Let's all rock the state in '92!

BERLIN MAY 1, 1992
by Dirk Gomez <djg@cs.tu-berlin.de>

The revolutionary demo met as usual at 1 pm in Kreuzberg.  When I came
at 2 pm, the first what I saw was a mass fight between some masked
"Autonome" and stalinist guys who tried to force the demo for their
route! Fuck them, they are only 50-100 guys but they are so well
organized that they make trouble for 5000 people. 

But their route was (fortunately) denied and the march began.  At 2
o'clock we passed a computer shop which is very new.  Some weeks ago
there was a scene pub.  Astonishingly there was no police so that this
shop was plundered.  Really funny to see 10 year old boys running around
with a big computer :)

About 1 hour later we passed a really big cop car which was protected by
only one cop.  So he ran and some guys burnt the car down. 

After that the police lost for about 30 mins control, cause they thought
that the riot will begin in SO 36 (where the demo should end).  Now some
cars were smashed and pulled on the street ... 

Being back in Kreuzberg the demo ended and I and my friends went about
100 m away from the notorious "rioting street".  Nothing much happened
we only saw masses of cops.  btw there were about 4000-4500 cops
there!!!

At 7 I left for home and about 11 o'clock I went again to SO36.  I
thought all was over but the cops made really much trouble.  Maybe they
were demonstrating for sth :-) :-(

All in all 300 arrests and 104 cops injured but only 3 so severe that
they couldn't go to work (so they had nothing!)

On the same day the neonazi party FAP wanted to demonstrate in the
East-Berlin "scene quarter" Prenzlauer Berg (where many Nazis live). 
About 50-80 people were there with an anti-demo with 200 (police)-800(a
friend) people.  The antifas heavily attacked the demo so the nazis left
the place with panic. 

On the evening there was a leftist demo in Prenzlauer Berg under the
motto "The East strikes back"...so it ended: with smashed windows ... 

So I guess next year: Same procedure as every year!

ZINE REVIEWS
by Chuck Munson

Welcome to Practical Anarchy Online's guide to the zine scene.  Most
of the stuff reviewed here is produced by anarchists, but not all.  This
section has sort of become obligatory in the zine scene--I'll review your
zine if you review mine.  The scene is rather healthy these days.
Sections like this help fill the void left by the demise of  Factsheet Five,
and that's OK, if not desirable given the decentralism celebrated in
 the zine scene.  I try to review everything sent to me.  If something
 you sent me isn't reviewed here it either was lost in the mail, I
misplaced it, or I ran out of space and time.

Anal Society        No.1 / 1992        $1
        c/o FIA, 215 N. Frances St. #205, Madison, WI 53703
A new xeroxed, free-form zine put out by some folks here in Madison.
Stuff on vegetarianism, poetry, and anarchy.  Lots of band interviews
and ads for music.  Classic punk-style anarchic collage.

Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed    No.33 / Summer 1992
        C.A.L., PO Box 1446, Columbia, MO 65205-1446
        The Newsweek of anarchist newspapers (just kidding). Anarchy
successfully switches to a new format with this issue.  They've gone
from a large tabloid size to a smaller size (8 inches by 10.5 inches).  The
design looks very professional - quite a change from the issues I have
that came out seven years ago.  As always, an excellent letters section,
extensive international anarchist news, and extensive listings of
resources of interest to anarchists.  I urge everybody to read John
Zerzan's thought-provoking article "Future Primitive" in which he
summarizes the recent anthropological evidence which supports
many anarchist theories.  Other articles include one on Columbus
by Ward Churchill and a critique of bicycles by Michael William.  Also
 an excerpt from the upcoming anthology "Gone to Croatan," which I
am looking forward to.

Discussion Bulletin        No.55 / Sept./Oct. 1992
        PO Box 1564, Grand Rapids, MI 49501
A theoretical zine devoted to furthering a discussion amongst "non-
market, anti-statist and libertarian socialists."  These groups reject
"capitalism's wage, market, and money system along with capitalist
politics and unionism constitutes the only real alternative to
capitalism in both its market and statist phases."  This is the first
issue I've ever seen, so the following comments might not be relevant
(apparently this publication just switched from offset to xerox).  I find
the layout to be rather uninspiring -- xerox doesn't have to look this
bad, and some graphics might help.  Some interesting articles here, like
the one on green anarchism, but the rest reads like the tired leftist
doggerel with all of the appropriate buzzwords: proletarian,
internationalism, comrades, and the like.  Several pages were
unreadable (bad print job).

dreamtime talkingmail        number 2 / Spring 1992
        Miekal And & Elizabeth Was, editors.
        Twice a year . Send donation
        Dreamtime Village  Rt.2 Box 242W  Viola, WI 54464
        Zine created by the folks who live at the Dreamtime Village project
in rural Wisconsin.  The Village is a wild amalgam of anarchy,
permaculture, music, and grassroots and avant garde art.  Practical
anarchy in action.  Recommended.

Fifth Estate        Vol. 27/ no.1 (339) Spring 1992
        4632 Second Ave.  Detroit, MI 48201
        Quarterly        $1.50 single issue $6.00/year
        The highlight of this issue is the interesting and timely article by
 George Bradford titled "The Triumph of Capital."  Bradford, who in
previous issues of FE has written articulate critiques of deep ecology,
 tackles the implications of the "fall of communism."  An article on
Alexander Berkman is also in this issue as well as the usual, excellent
roundup of anarchist news, letters, and book reviews.  Also inspiring
write-ups of anarchist projects in the Detroit area.

GameDay
        1653 Wisconsin Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20007
        $15 (10 issues)
        Zine/newsletter/program for fans of the baseball Baltimore Orioles.
Picked up a copy outside Oriole Park at Camden Yards (the baseball
stadium).  Published before each homestand.  Articles on pennant races
and tips on where to find parking.  Has summaries on how players have
been doing recently and includes their salaries.  Heard that publications
like this are under pressure from the baseball teams to cease publishing.
A refreshing alternative to the glossy official programs sold inside
the stadium.

Kick It Over        No. 29 / Summer 1992
        PO Box 5811, Station A  Toronto, Ontario, Canada  M5W 1P2
        $2.50 Canada/USA
        I would like to point out the article titled "Building Economic
Alternatives' by Gary Moffatt, which I found thought-provoking.  Other
articles include "The Abortion Underground' and "The Population
Myth" by Murray Bookchin and one on billboard alterations.  Also
lots of news briefs.  Read this one from cover to cover.

Noisy Concept        No. 15 / May, June, July, August 1992
        c/o Mike Thain, 621 Bassett Rd., Bay Village, OH 44140
        $.50 ppd.  $4/10 issues
        "The Journal of Deviant Culture and Voluntary Insanity."
        A zine devoted to "punk rock, vegetarianism, and anarchy."
Congratulations or condolences to Mike on having his zine listed in a
 recent USA Today articles on "zines."

Profane Existence        No.14 (May-June) No.15 (Summer)
        No.16 (September-October 1992)  Bi-monthly
        PO Box 8722, Minneapolis, MN 55408
        $2 ppd.    $10.50/6 issues    $9 Third Class
        Since the last issue of Practical Anarchy I've been able to get my
hands on the much talked about Profane Existence.  And I am
impressed!  I can't say enough about this newspaper.  I know what
the folks in Minneapolis are doing is an inspiration to many in the
 Midwest and I can see why.  In each issue you will find anarchist
and activist news from around the world, articles, columns, and zine
and music reviews.  I'd say that you can find lots of "practical anarchy"
 in each issue.  The folks in the Twin Cities are actually building
alternative institutions and their paper documents these projects.
PE has a militant style which I think is very effective.  Lots of energy;
 not much dogma.  "Making Punk a Threat Again."

Second Guess        No.3 / Summer 1992
        PO box 9382, Reno, NV 89507
        A xeroxed zine that covers the music and cultural scene in Reno and
the rest of Nevada.  Zine reviews and an interview with the
controversial Mykel Board.  Check out the interesting practical anarchy
suggestions and fun pranks.  Gee, and I thought Nevada was all sand
and gambling!  Nicely done.

SLAM                No.1 / August/September 1992
        PO Box 22861, Alexandria, VA 22304
        $1        $5/year (six issues)
        This is the first issue in what hopes to be a zine that features zine
and record reviews.  They reprint the text of the Bloods & Crips
program to rebuild LA -- which if you haven't read, you ought to.
Political news, commentary, and graphics.  A pretty decent first try.

Social Anarchism        No.17 / 1992
        2743 Maryland Ave., Baltimore, MD 21218
        $10/4 issues
        This journal always has an excellent, extensive book review section.
Each issue also includes poetry (which I don't always read, not being
a big poetry fan).  Articles in this issue cover: pirate radio, women
living in egalitarian intentional communities, and anarcho-feminism.
SA features some of the best anarchist writing on the continent today.

Internet Relay Chat

IRC is a place to talk on, not unlike the old CB that radio amateurs
used. You join a channel of your choice. Typical channels are #gblf
(for Gays, Bisexuals, Lesbians and Friends) and #anarchy.

To get onto IRC you need an IRC client at a place virtually near you,
i.e. at a site you've got an account on. Ask around if there allready
is one installed. If not, consider compiling one of your own.

You can try out IRC by telnetting to bradenville.andrew.cmu.edu (no
login) or santafe.santafe.edu (login: irc). Take a look at the help
facility when you're on and don't be shy to ask for help. 

As soon as I'm own I try to keep the channels #future and #anarchy
open. I suggest you do the same so these channels are there virtually
all the time. See you there!

THE ANARCHISTS MANUAL
by conan the barbarian

trip wires

you can use an m-80, h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive
that will light a fuse.  if you have a 9-volt battery, from a radio
controlled car or whatever, and get either a solar igniter
(preferably) or some steel wool, you can create a remote ignition
switch.  to do this, set up a schematic:

        ------------------> battery (+)
 steel ||                -> battery (-)
 wool  ||                /
  :==:---  <--fuse       \
       ||                /
       ---- spst switch--\

when the switch is on, the current will flow through the steel wool or igniter
and heat up, lighting the fuse in the process.
--- note: for steel wool, get a very thin piece of wire first and pump the
    current through it, to make sure it will get hot enough to light the fuse.

now plant your explosive wherever you want it, but bury it and cover the wires
thoroughly.  now get some wire (20 lb. test fishing line works well) amd tie
one end to a secure object.  secure the switch to something, and make a loop on
the other end of the fish line.  put the loop around the switch so that when it
is pulled, it will flip the switch and detonate the explosive.  note: this is
only one way of rigging it.  feel free to experiment!

landmines

first, get a push-button switch.  connect one side to a 9-volt battery, and the
other to a solar igniter (or steel wool.)  now connect the other end of the
igniter to the other battery terminal. next, fasten the end of your explosive's
fuse (m-80, pipe bomb, etc.) to the ingiter.
   decide where you want the mine, and dig a hole (not too deep, but enough to
cover all your equipment.)  decide what direction your enemy will be coming
from, and plant the switch accordingly.  leave the switch partially exposed,
but make sure it's difficult to see it.  plant the explosive about three feet
from the switch, because there will be a delay before the explosion.  when your
enemy steps on it,  b o o m ! ! !

basic tactics of car destruction

all the best methods of blowing up a car require that you get under
the hood.  explosives are placed as close to the occupants as
possible, for maximum damage and killing effectiveness.  one good
explosive is several sticks of dynamite (about three) taped together
with duct tape or electrical tape.
   the fuse, which can be homemade, commercial or safety, is wrapped around the
exhaust manifold a few times.  after driving for awhile, the manifold gets hot
enough to ignite the fuse.  this method has several advantages over simply
wiring the car to explode.  first, if the explosion doesn't kill the victim,
the crash probably will.  second, if the victim is a passenger, the driver
might start the car before the victim gets in.  that could get a little
embarrassing for the bomber, couldn't it...?
   old-fashioned types, like the mafia, would rather wire cars.  they want to
see the car blowing up instead of letting it do so on the road.  they usually
use three sticks of dynamite, two lengths of electric wire (with alligator
clips for easy attachment) and an electric blasting cap.  the cap is stuck into
a stick of dynamite, and its wires are attached to the electric wires.  then
one alligator clip is clipped to the input side of the coil, and the other is
fastened to any metal surface in the car's frame as a ground.

carbide bomb

*** caution:  this is extremely dangerous.  be very careful!

   obtain some calcium carbide.  this is the stuff used in carbide lapps, and
can be found at almost any hardware store.  take a few pieces (it looks like
gravel) and put them in a glass jar with some water.  put a lid on tightly.
the carbide will react with the water to produce acetylene carbonate, which is
similar to the gas used in cutting torches.  eventually, the jar will explode
from internal pressure.  (don't use a super-strong jar or it might not break.)
if you leave a burning rag nearby, you'll get a nice fireball.

portable grenade launcher

if you have a bow, this one is for you.  remove the ferrule from an aluminum
arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder.  (try grade ffff, it burns easily)
glue a shotshell primer into the hole where the ferrule was.  next, glue a bb
onto the primer, and you're ready to go!
   make sure nobody is around, because little shreds of aluminum go everywhere.

auto-exhaust flame thrower

for this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a simple
toggle switch.  install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the
exhaust pipe by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.  attach
the wire (regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch, and to the spark
plug.  the other side of the switch is attached to the positive battery
terminal.  with the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames!
be careful that nobody's behind you.  the flames can shoot out twenty feet.

section II -- pipe bombs

co2 canisters

co2 canisters are among the simplest and safest forms of pipe bombs.  they
can be purchased in any sporting goods store for about $.50 each.  simply
release the co2 inside, and fill them with gunpowder.  if you can't obtain
gunpowder, use powdered zinc and sulfur.  (60% zinc, 40% sulfur, by volume.)
   fill your co2 with whatever explosive you are using.  plug the end with a
fuse (1/16 of an inch diameter), light it, and run.  there is usually only one
of shrapnel, about the size of your fist.  make sure the outer surface of your
bomb is free of gunpowder.  otherwise, it could detonate several seconds early.

standard pipe bomb

ok, heres how to make your standard pipe bomb.  go to your local junkyard (or
anywhere, for that matter) and get a piece of pipe of whetever size you want.
thread each end (on the outside) and cap one end.  drill a hole in the middle
of the pipe, and stick your fuse in the hole.  fill the pipe with one of the
explosives mentioned earlier, oil the open end, and cap it very carefully.
if you don't oil the ends, it could spark.  if it sparks, you're in trouble...
so oil it before you cap this end.  then put it in a hole with a long fuse,
light it, and run like hell.

BOYCOTT & BUYCOTT
by Chuck & cardell

Boycott:

Cracker Barrel Restaurants:  Still discriminating against gays and
lesbians in employment.  Various gay and lesbian groups around the
 US have called for this boycott.  So far, the chain seems to have
deaf ears.

The town of Springfield, Oregon [U.S.]:  This town recently passed a
restrictive law against gay and lesbian rights.  This guarantees a climate
of hate ripe for bashing.  Don't visit this town or buy products from
companies located there.

McDonalds:  Let's put them out of business.  Various reasons to do so:
excessive packaging, encourages a world to be more car dependent,
encourages people to eat too much meat, and slick advertising designed
to get children hooked on a lifetime McDonalds habit.

Buycott:

This is a list of companies whose products hasn't been tested on
animals taken from a list that a Swedish organisation publishes. It's
used without any permission whatsoever. :)

In this list there might be companies that should be boycotted anyway,
but if so, it has nothing to do with testing on animals. Please notify
us if there is.

V in front of the company name means their products doesn't contain
anything from animals. B means there is, but that that it's natural
animal products like milk and such. M means there's make up products
in the serie as well as other things.
