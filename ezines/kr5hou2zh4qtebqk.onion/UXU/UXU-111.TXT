               NOW IT CAN BE TOLD - uXu MEMBERS SPEAKS OUT

              "A Maniac with a lot of knowledge is a threat."
                                                -Someone


    A Year With uXu. What can be said that hasn't been said already?
    Mind is perpetual motion, its symbol is the sphere, someone said.
    So ask yourself this: Have you ever really 'met' the uXu writers?
    I can honestly answer that question for all of you. No.

    In this file, you'll meet the members, talking about their time
    with and without uXu. We're sorry that we couldn't include a few
    words from our U.S. contributors, but we were unable to reach
    them in time (how unlikely that may seem) for this release.

    This file works as a complement to the "A Year With uXu" file,
    written by me, included in the previous release. This file lets
    the members speak out and tell their uncensored (as always)
    version, from the moment they joined. Enjoy.

                                                       The Chief

 THE GNN - DualCrew/uXu

   A few words about my year with uXu should not be a story about me alone.
It should mainly be about the people who I am grateful to, Phearless and
The Chief.
  It all simply started when I called The Chief's BBS, in those days it was
called Info Addict, and discovered the pile of text files he had online.
By some reason, it inspired me to start writing - I guess it all had to do
with the fact that I now could write for fun, AND also get more than one
person to read it.  H/P/A was the main concept at the time, or at least A
for me.  After a while The Chief asked me to join, and I gladly did so.  I
feel that he has always believed in what I write - why should he otherwise
bother to spend money uploading the uXu files at various boards?  It feels
good, but I wish he and Phearless could write more files themselves - since
they are marvellous.
  During this year, Phearless have always been the one who have read and
commented all of my files.  His critic have been very valuable for my
further writing and he has also helped me to make my files look better by
carefully checking my mediocre english.  Only one file carries both of our
names, but there are several more that I have written inspired by long
philosophical talks between me and him. 
  There is just one thing that I cannot stand with him - he does not accept
the fact that motion is impossible.
  We have had some contributors to the uXu series but just one guy have
contributed with really interesting files.  Of course I am talking about
Sarlo, who really can make you laugh.  Sadly, there has only been a few
files from him, but the ones we have to offer are really incredible.
  So, The Chief just wanted a short file about my year with Underground
eXperts United so this file ends

  here

PHEARLESS - uXu

   Ahh... one year? Shit... This means I've wasted yet another twelwe months
on useless working, modeming, beering, boozing and partying. Yeah, and
some hours of supporting uXu and uXu members. One hour is about one 8,760th
part of a year. Wonder how many tenths of a year I've spent modeming. Let's
see... minimum two hours a day, maximum 24 hours a day. Average per day
would be something like 2-3 hours a day, all year. That's about 54,750
minutes. Shit. At national long distance rates that's about the same amount
in SEK, i e about US $7,821. At international rates that's about five times
that amount of cash you have to throw down the throat of the Swedish telco.
I would guess about 0.02 per cent of all that time had something to do
with some activites concerning the uXu. This means that the uXu is indirect
responsible for the loss of SEK 1095 (US $156!). I e the uXu owe the Swedish
telco an enormous amount of money! Who will have to pay this! The other
swedish callers? The tax payers? The prime minister? Who? Well I for one
don't give a shit anyway so I guess the telco won't even notice the little
uXu debt... However, it's been fun writing now and then for the uXu, and
I plan on doing it in the future as well, if you just keep those eyes of
yours open long enough.

   So if you some day, deep into the woods of Sweden, spot a strange
creature wearing all black sitting behind a tree talking to himself (or in his
telephone), don't fear! You can be sure (well almost sure) that it's the
almost-hit-a-moose-when-he-was-out-biking-in-the-middle-of-the-night Phearless
out enjoying himself, and other people's phone lines.

RALPH 124C41+ - uXu

   Well, let's start with a presentation of myself. I'm known (or perhaps
not) as Ralph 124C41+ and I'm now (March '93) 22 years old. My real name
is Staffan Vilcans and I'm of a mixed swedish-latvian origin.

   In my spare time (which is something I don't have a lot of) I usually
sit around with my computer and modem, calling BBSes. I'm also the SysOp
of Castor, a small BBS here in Stockholm, Sweden. Sometimes I program and
I guess you know that I write textfiles. One of my other hobbies is beer.
Both drinking and making, a textfile about beer is on it's way!

   Computers is my main interest and have been so since I was ten. I have a
ZX Spectrum 128K, a Commodore 64, an Amiga 500 and two PC-clones. And as a
fact I still use every one of them from time to time.

   Oh dear, this perhaps wasn't so short so I'd better get on with my time
in uXu. Well, it started when I uploaded a textfile I had written to The
Stash and then The Chief told me he had a group of writers and asked if I
wanted to join in. I agreed and in the next uXu release you could find two
texts by me. It was my erotic story "The New Girl at Work" and "A Joke for
VMS-users". Later on I have written some other text from time to time.
Right now I'm working on two big files and some smaller so you should look
out for what I have coming in the next release, or perhaps the one after
that... I really don't know when I get the urge to write again.

<WRAP> Oops, I wasn't a scrolltext... ;-)
