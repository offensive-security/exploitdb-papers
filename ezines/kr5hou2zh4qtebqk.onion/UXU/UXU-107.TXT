  Hopefully, the rest is pretty much ok. Well, let's not fill this file with
  junk! Here we go.



@SONG: Already Yours

A gift from God, a small creation
A prized possession without limitations
Behind these eyes, what do you see that isn't
already yours
already yours
already yours

In fact I never wanted anything more
In fact I've never wanted anything less
Oh [...] shouldn't treat me like a stranger
Do you see I have the same effect
Only this time on you

Behind your eyes, what can I see that isn't
already you
already you
already you

Voices of angels that I have [...]
Voices of angels I have [...]
Voices of angels I have [...]
Voices of angels that I have [...]

Behind these eyes, what can I see that isn't
already there
already yours
already there
already, already yours

(BV: Don't run away) [repeat 6]



@SONG: Horror Head

Fireworks, red and green
I can see what they sing
But you are away

You always smile

Boxing ring
The back of mules
You can really see, from the inside
Across the room

There's a horror in my head
When the blanket is gone
From the floor in my castle
Where I see the sun from

There's a horror in my head
When the blanket is gone
From the floor in my castle
Where I see the sun from

In the comfort of this room
The challenge died
Remember you and me
We laughed 'til we cried



@SONG: Wish You Dead

You can dig that knife
Deep down inside me
Just don't say never again
It's that only thing
That stops me going crazy

I know you won't
'Cause you never do
And that's the nicest thing about you

So uncaring, so assuming
Back-stabbing, all-consuming

Don't step over my head
Don't step over my head

You can filter your poison into my sleep
But I know it's my heart
That you could never reach

I know you won't
'Cause the tools you choose
And that's the ugliest thing about you

So uncaring, so assuming
Back-stabbing, all-consuming

I've told a thousand lies through me
I've sold a thousand lies for you

Don't step over my line
Don't step over my time
Don't step over my head
'Cause I will wish you dead [repeat 7]



@SONG: Doppelg„nger

Oh, the devil is in me
Oh, the devil is in me
Oh, the spirit is in me
Oh, the spirit is in me

I don't know what I should do now
Show me what I should be doing now

Am I wearing my right dress?
Am I wearing the right shoes?
Am I wearing my right face?

You just hate me for being born
You just hate me for being me
You just hate me for being born
You just hate me for knowing you
[...]

All I ever wanted
Was to be the night in your eyes

Am I thinking the right things?
Am I in my right mind?
Am I wearing my right head?

You just hate me for being born
You just hate me for being me
You just hate me for being born
You just hate me for knowing you
[...]

Do I have a real heart?
Do I think with an open mind?
Do I have real blood?
Pumping through my veins
Moving through my veins
Moving through my veins

Pressing between
Pushing through my veins

You just hate me for being born
You just hate me for being me



@SONG: Lillies Dying

Eyes in me see
Nobody is perfect
Not even you
Not even you

Crawl for me like a child
Just go back to what you were
'Cause I don't like you, anymore

I've got no problem with you
You can come in
I just don't want to upset you
So make your mind up
Got to sharpen you

'Cause lillies dying in the front room

Try to understand
Nothing is easy
The first time 'round
The first time 'round

And angers are all we see
When you come, is that misery

I've got no problem with you
You can come in
I don't want to upset you
So make your mind up
Sharpen you

'Cause lillies dying in the front room

There's no problem with you
You can come in
I don't want to upset you
So make your mind up
Sharpen you

'Cause lillies dying in the front room



@SONG: Ice That Melts The Tips

Blue, I'm blue as the water
It's true, I'm cleaner than the air
You breathe, I'm clearer than sunsets
And the picture, of that woman in your heart

Push me into [...]
Push me into [...]

I'm Cold, I'm colder than ice that melts the tips
Of the only questions, that really exist, to you
The horizon, Frozen moonlight in your eye in my eyes

Push me into [...]
Push me into [...]

[...] [repeat 8]

I'm clearer than sunsets
Of the person that sleeps in your heart



@SONG: Split Into Fractions
 
[...] much more from [...]
I can't confide all I want to
Spiteful in fact of life
Not everyone you meet is that nice
When we scratch below the surface

Characters have merged, [...]
That split into fractions in front of your eyes

I'm so bitchin', love to be it
My friends and I just love to meet
We meet all the time 'cause we think we're clever
So surreal, it makes us feel better
We think we're so, clever

Characters have merged [...]
That split into fractions in front of their eyes
In front of their eyes

There is nothing to behold
In front of them,
You can't be sure what you're dealing with
And that's got to be good for you

Die on the cross before I'd cross you
You know I'd never hurt you
I'm just not that type of girl



@SONG: Think and Act
 
I know you, better than yourself
You think and act but you can't convince me
I've heard suspicions in the middle of the night
And they [...], they [...]

Some people say I'm high up
And some people say I'm false
But others say I'm arrogant
But what do they know, what do they know

They all say I won't listen
I won't listen to any criticism
If they could be me for a day of their lives
Then they'd know, then they'd say

[...] 
They'd say, [...]
They'd say, burning down to the ground

And I don't listen anymore
And I don't listen anymore
And I don't listen anymore
And I don't listen anymore

I know you
You think and act but you can't, you cant, you just can't
I've heard suspicions, they don't mean a thing to me
Now, now you know me so well

You just, [...]
You just, [...]
You just, [...] to the ground

And I don't listen anymore
And I don't listen anymore
And I don't listen anymore
And I don't listen anymore

No, no no no, I don't listen
You think and act but you can't, you can't, you just can't
You think and act but you can't

[...]
Slowly
Slowly

Ooh, we are in paradise
We
We, we are in paradise
Paradise



@SONG: FaŒt Accompli

Every day, there is some kind of darkness
That just won't go away, no matter how hard I try
It crawls into your system while your guard is down
Becomes a ball that you drag around to

Every party
To every function
To give to people with written instructions
Don't try to get away, I'm here to stay
My name is

(BV: Fate) [repeat 2]

Every night, sleep wanders on its own
Never once, does it kiss me, with its chloroform
Crawled into my system while my guard was down
Became the boy I like to have around at

Every party
At every function
I give it to people with written instructions
Don't try to get away, I'm here to stay
My name is your fate

(BV: Fate)

I've come to crush your bones    (BV: Fate)
I've come to make you feel old   (BV: Fate)
I've come to mess with your head (BV: Fate)
It'll make you feel good

I've come to make you feel good
I've come to make you feel good
I've come to make you feel good (BV: all right)
I've come to make you feel good (BV: all right)
I've come to make you feel good (BV: all right)
I've come to make you feel good (BV: all right)

(BV: all right)
(BV: all right)

Come to the party
Come to the function
Give me aggression with written instructions
Don't try to get away, I'm here to stay
Hear me now

(BV: Fate)
(BV: Fate) [repeat 10]



@SONG: Sandpit

Are we savages, born without hope
Last on these highways, existing to go
Swallowed my pride, gutted me from the inside
Left me in this pool of doubt
Now I don't think I can get out

But you can laugh, you can laugh, you can laugh
'Cause you think that you're better than me

If we are the instigators, of our times
Why do we harmonize then revolutionize our crimes
Down in this sandpit of misbegotten youth
We can show them the songs, the one truth

But you can laugh, you can laugh, you can laugh
'Cause you think that you're better than
You think that you're better than everyone

I'm just trying to do the right thing
I'm just trying to do the right thing
The right thing

Escape to my eyes [repeat 5]
