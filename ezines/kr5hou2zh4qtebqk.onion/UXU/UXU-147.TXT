*   The intro.           "Break it up, break it down."

    I'd like to say that this release has been delayed a thousand times.
    Nothing grabs time as life can do itself, but this one was amazing.
    People lost access to computers (ie. hard drives crashed, modems
    burned), some had trouble with tough exams, new distribution sites
    were checked more than once, due to the delay, numbers changed,
    people change. Maybe it's time for another Life file huh? <g>. But.
    Here we are, another release. Files from The GNN, The Chief and
    a new really promising contributor, Hedge. From fiction to lyrics.
    There are two other special releases on the way, which we think
    you'll like. One in english and the other in swedish. Due to some
    size limitations on our side, these will probably not be sent out
    to the mailing list, but will be available from the FTP/FSP sites.
    It is possible that we'll send them out in pieces though, but more
    about that when it happens.



    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?

    Jeppers! All files (0-147) are available from the sites listed at the
    end of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 003,022,054,065,023

    To subscribe, just let the BODY of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are stars (or
    multiplication characters) which let you know what's new since
    last time. You don't have to read through the whole index for
    the latest info, just scan the file for the stars.


                                                       The Chief / uXu
                    "Don't start playing games that you can't finish."

        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.
*                     Password protected files are okay too.

August  November  August  November  August  November Releases 1993:

138: "The Last Frontier" by The GNN.   A rational statement trying to
see through the government's interest in the wide area networks of
today. A couple of answers to questions if this is good or bad, and
what will probably happen in the near future is presented here.

139: "Letters To The State" by Anon. Contributors.   This one was
sent to uXu through an anonymous mail-address, to be published with
this release. It's a story of lies, "dangerous people with computers",
informers and the police.

140: "The Killing Truth" by The GNN.   The truth can be fatal, we all
know that. But how fatal can it be? If you knew, would you care, or
would something else happen to you? Do you dare to know?

141: "uXu Lyrics: Curve - Radio Sessions" by The Chief.   One of the
best Curve collections out on the market today. Their Peel sessions
are better and differs from the originals. You a Curve fan? Scope
this one out.

142: "The Lynch Mob" by The GNN.   Crisis, governments, scape-goats,
refugees, anarchists and the 'normal' people. The GNN corrects the
picture on the wall with yet another insightful look under the
magnifying glass on how the world works. Do you believe?

143: "Prometheus Symptom" by The GNN.   Creeping fiction from the
meister himself. Knowledge, power and pain. People say knowledge
is power. At least right now.

144: "Vengeance!" by Hedge.   Now there's a new name in the game.
Hedge presents himself with a story that might just not be fiction
at all. Or is it? The guilty ones know for sure.

145: "Rage!" by The GNN.   Yes, Rage. Will you put up with anything?
What do you do when someone tells you to go to hell? Do you do that
then? I don't think so. What do you do when someone tells you to do
something? Depends on who it is, right? The police?

146: "The Power" by The GNN.   If you read GNN's last, really popular
one called 'Meanwhile', you will love this one. And it is so true,
so true. You'll get the message.

147: "uXu Index #13" by The Chief.   Perhaps the index isn't needed
anymore? What do You think? Let me know! E-Mail me with your comments
and we'll head the way you turn us to. Though we've got one for this
release doesn't mean there aren't any new sections, new information,
general statistics and, just for fun a couple of those sections are
liste neatly and well below for you:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact uXu.

      [#147 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
