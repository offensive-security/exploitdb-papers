                              "JUDGEMENT DAY"
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu

                          "Wake up, time to die!"
                                    (Blade runner)

  With a hard thump I landed on the cold floor. Something had thrown
me out of my bed in the middle of the night. Even worse, the whole city
was on fire. Later, I discovered that the whole world was in flames.

  Confused? Well...I'm sorry but that's the way it happened. I am Roger
WorldClassified and I live in MegaCity One. I lived anyway. I'm not sure
anymore. I feel a sudden urge to tell you the strange things that happened
to me a while ago. To be brief - It was a normal day until I suddenly was
taken to another strange place. Then it was back to normal again. 

  Yes, I will be more precise. Listen carefully. 

  I came back from work about six o'clock yesterday afternoon. I felt rather
tired and went to bed early. Ah yes, naturally I watched the HFF news and
at that point the world looked quite alright. I mean, it was still THERE.
As I said, I went to bed early. Then - CRASH! I flew, yes FLEW!, out of the
bed and landed on the floor! "Earthquake...again", i thought, but no no!

  When I looked up and out of the window I saw something strange. MegaCity
One was in flames! Yes, all buildings, everything was burning with a red hot 
light! "Yeah!" was my first thought. Gone with that sucker who billed me for
speeding last week. I don't know why I thought such a strange thing but
at that time it seemed perfectly normal.

  "Listen, ROGER! You are the chosen one.", a deep, dark and utterly
unpleasant voice suddenly said behind me. I turned around and faced...
...uhm...something. My room was still dark even if the goddamn city was
burning outside! This "something" stood (?) sat (?) in the other end of
the room. He (?) was wearing dark clothes and a kind of monk-thing over
his head. You know - like Death use to have on pictures. Then I got scared,
what would happen if this actually WAS death who was speaking to me?

  "This is Judgement Day!", that fellow in the dark clothes said to me
with that unpleasant voice again. Then, a bright flash came from somewhere
inside him. I was blind for a moment, and when I could see again
...Holy Mother!

  I was flying, YES! I was flying over something that must have been 
MegaCity One! The man with the black clothes was out of sight but inside
my head, I heard his voice.

  "Look Roger! This is the end of this time! This is Judgement Day!", the
voice said to me, over and over again. The things I saw was horrible...

  I saw cities after cities, all of them burning. I saw people, running
around in total chaos. Anarchy, violence...everything! At once! Something
must have made everybody mad! I saw people who ate other humans, I saw
people who cut their throats. I must have flown all over the world!
In China - death! In Africa - death! In Europe - death! If this was
judgement day, and all people suffered like this, what would happen to me?

  Something came into my mind. It was a song, and it must have been sung
by the people, no! Creatures, below me!

  "end end end of time"
  "day day day judgement day"
  "end end end..."
  
  If I was the chosen one, were I the one responsible for all this? At the
end of the ride, would they be waiting for me? The creatures, the things
that used to be humans...
  
  No, they were not. Because, suddenly this incredible vision was gone.
I found myself on a white floor with white walls around. It was an
enormous room! Oh yes, in the middle of it - me! 

  Me! Me! I was there! I was the chosen one, but whatthehell was I
chosen to do? Was this some kind of competition? Just when I was on
my way to try to find the exit of this, I got the answer.

  "I...am...The...Creator...", another voice said. From the other end 
of the room I could see something that looked like a man walk towards
me. He came closer. When he was close enough I saw that it was a man
wearing white clothes, with white short hair and no eyes. Yes, no eyes!
They were simply plain white. Now I got real scared, I tell you!
He talked again,

  "This is Judgement Day! This is the end of this time!"

  "So?", I said.

  He didn't answer. Then it was all over. I woke up in my bed again, the
MegaCity One was back. No one had heard anything of any burning 
houses, less about a burning world. Judgement Day? Wasn't it supposed the
end of the time according to all books? 

  Now, a long time afterwards, I remember something another thing. The man
with no eyes had said something else. I don't know why I didn't remember
it until now, maybe it was some kind of trauma? The man without the eyes
had spoken to me, with a low voice,

  "This...is judgement day..."

  Then it was a small silence, as if he was looking for the words.

  "Don't judge me to hard..."
