                      THE UNPAID WORKERS OF POLITICS

                           We are Robots part II



  Ever had the feeling that your rights concerning freedom to read what you
want,  to  have  what ever opinions you want etc.  are safe in the hands of
the  government?   Think  again  my friend.  It has never been more obvious
than  now,  that  these rights can, and will, be compromised as soon as the
ruling superiors can get the opinion on their side to do so.

  Take  for  example  Sweden,  which  is,  I think, one of the more liberal
countries  when it comes to issues like this.  Recently though, I have come
to  revise that opinion.  During these last months, there have been a major
racket  concerning  child  pornography,  and all the bigger newspapers here
have  raised  their  voices against these perverts.  The reason for this is
that  the  police  made an enormous bust against a suspected distributor of
child  porn,  and found  films where the contents were even more disgusting
than they  had  expected.   (the number  of  films and names of buyers were
also a lot bigger ).

  You  see  here  in Sweden it is against the law to distribute child porn,
but  its  not  illegal to possess it, so when the police found addresses at
the  bust,  it was apparent that he intended to share his little films with
others  of  the  same mind, and had therefore committed a crime when having
these  films  and  articles.   If  he hadn't had these addresses the police
hadn't  been able to touch him, because possession of child porn goes under
the  freedom  of press article.  The papers and media in general, as I said
earlier,  made  a  lot  of noise about this, claiming that in circumstances
like these, an exception should be made in the freedom to possess what ever
pervert  magazines  you'd  like.   They also invited several members of the
government  to  see what child porn REALLY was.  (Since governments in most
countries seem to think they know  about everything, but really haven't got
any idea  about  anything,  this  was  really a smart move as we soon shall
see.) The  members  was  disgusted  and  some  even  cried  live  on TV and
everything. The  comments  made  sounded  something like this:  "I couldn't
imagine it was that  horrible...",  "We must immediately  create a law that
forbids even possession of material of this sort..."


  And so the wheels turned....


  At  this  very minute the law proposal has gone out to several committees
for  examination, and it appears to me that it will not take very long time
for them to clear this one through, even though it means violating Sweden's
constitution  upon  which  all  our  laws  and everything rests.  Normally,
changes  in  the constitution should demand (I think), that two parliaments
vote  for the proposal, with an government election in between.  (something
like  that anyway, but it is always a hard thing to pull off).  Not in this
case  however, and a spokesman for the government said "in cases like this,
the  contents of the constitution has to come as a second priority".  Well,
well, not bad for being a politician elected by the people, whose job is to
prevent these sort of things to happen, don't you think?

  What  the  government  will  do,  if they pull this one off, is to make a
moral statement, not to prevent children from being molested.  The law that
they  happily  will  make  changes  in  our constitution for, wont make any
changes,  because the people involved in child porn, or gets off on it wont
care about the law.  It is also very difficult for the police to be granted
a  search  warrant  in  such  cases  where  they  suspect a person to be in
possession  of child porn.  IF anyone gets caught it will merely be because
they  fucked  up in some way, sheer bad luck or that someone drops the dime
on   them.   (and  that  may  be  exactly  what  the  police  are  counting
with...snitches are nothing new to them, and the opinion tide made by media
is paving the way...)

  The  conclusion  to  be  drawn is this:  The mechanisms that were made to
prevent  changes  to the constitution, can easily be overruled just as long
as  the  public opinion is strong enough.  It doesn't matter what the issue
is, convince the crowd and they will do the job for you.

(I  hope  that  you  don't  get  me  wrong,  I  hate child porn, and things
associated with it probably as much as anyone else, but the people who gets
off  on  it  are  in  my mind sick and should be encouraged to seek help, a
hasty made  law  that  overrules  the  constitution  against  their  sexual
preferences wont do any good.)

  Now,  before  you  go  to  bed tonight, think of this:  The government in
your  country  decides that no one under the age of 30 should be allowed to
possess  a  computer, since younger people isn't mature enough to have one.
(or  worse,  possession of a computer is banned for everyone except for the
police,   government   and  those  who  need  it  in  their  business.   NO
home-computers  would be allowed.) They set up a massive media attention on
computer  crimes,  and  in  that way they will get the stupid mass on their
side.   Suddenly  your government has created and approved a law forbidding
the  use  of home-computers in homes, and in this case they didn't even had
to compromise the constitution...

  Sweet Dreams!
