                             "CITY OF SLAVES"

                       "Bar the door. Bar the door.
                        The door is barred.
                        We are safe. We are safe.
                        The enemy rage outside, he will tire"
                                          (T.S Eliot)



  The  morning  sun places a thin film of sweat on my face.  Naked streets,
trash  and dead people with no dreams left.  Sounds, hard facts and reality
everywhere.   The  crowded streets with myself in the middle.  A  forgotten
existence,  running  and  walking through the city of neon and concrete.  A
bartender  serves  whiskey with ice, amazed by my fresh voice.  Drinking up
all my money that I borrow every time..
  Ain't got the blues, ain't got the courage to leave the scene.  The smell
of  gasoline  fills  my soaked brain.  I am a pilot of a plane who has lost
the sense of direction. I fly and fly without a clue to where I am going. A
new day is nothing more than the morning sun and the evening breeze.
  I  want  the  life.   My  story  of  life  is about the little one.  Grey
buildings  rule  the  city,  looking around for more power.  I sleep by the
black  river  under  the moon, I live in the power of the city, waiting for
the lightning man to strike.
  Fresh.  Clean.  Not contaminated like the other slaves of the city.  Free
to live. Not caught in the machinery where everybody who leaves  need to be
replaced with violence.
  Born  in  the  seventies.  Crushed in the nineties.  Street-smart and old
now.   Opened up a bottle of champagne when the new century became visible,
drank  it  and  began  to  write.   Bought a type writer, stole a couple of
papers.
  Sitting  by the river, writing the story of my life.  My hands are typing
fast  -  I  still  remember  how to do it properly.  Finish one page at the
time,  pulling  it  out and dropping it into the black river.  See it float
away  and  start  with  a  new paper.  It is always the same.  Saw the last
piece  of paper float away a couple of years ago.  The story of my life was
to  an  end.   I  threw  the  typewriter  into  the river.  The black water
swallowed it with a dull sound.  A few dark waves said good bye and left me
alone.
  The  wood to my coffin is the strong liquid, the nails are the cigarettes
from  the  downtown  shop.  Toxic air, dead eyes, black sun glasses on blue
robots  who  protect  the  slaves.   A youth throw out some junk from a red
chevrolet.   I  walk fast, but not too fast, to the garbage, picking it up,
eating  what  can  be  eaten.   Found  a  broken  clock,  a  symbol for the
exterminated  time.   Gives  it to a friend for a dollar, buys something to
drink.  Feels death come back, disguised as life.
  Look  at  the  drunk, they say.  Look at his worn out clothes, his broken
shoes.   He  has  no  knowledge,  he  is  not educated.  He is trash, he is
nothing.   I am a loser and they are the servants of the city.  I prefer to
be  a  drunk.   I cannot do anything else.  But I am educated.  I know more
than most people do, despite of my dirty shell.
  The  blue  sky  has turned  grey thanks to the thousands of chimneys that
keeps  on  pumping  out  smoke as if they tried to race against each other.
The  slaves  of the city race  against each other in a desperate attempt to
reach the highest position. They all want to make it.  Make it to the house
of the Gods.  The house of the  Gods  are  inhabited  by the leaders of the
city. Whatever  they  become,  whatever they do, whatever they believe that
they are,  whatever  they decide to do,  everybody will  soon die and never
return to the city. Fire and forget while you got the chance, take what you
can take.  Eat the poor, kill the weak and race against the clock. Become a
well  oiled part of the machinery, thrust your kick out and praise your own
slavery.  Never look at any mirrors.
  The  no  mans  land is my home.  Here, I can walk around and look the the
other  people,  who  never  sees  me nor listens to my voice.  The truth is
dangerous,  better stay away from the truth.  Better look away and face the
twisted facts.  The reality is good as long as the reality is a cabaret for
the controlled masses, the slaves.
  I am not a slave and a servant of the city.  I am free but still trapped.
My  prison  is  my  life.   They took it away from me.  Robots on a mission
broke  down  my  door, stole my computer, told me to fuck off and leave the
nets  alone.   I wanted to know everything, how the world worked.  That was
not  allowed at all, they said, and the slaves nodded to show the Gods that
they  fully  agreed.   I lost my machine, my friends and my job.  I lost my
home and was thrown out on the streets.
  The  night  will  soon  be over.  A new day will come and give me another
chance.   I  cannot hack any more, I can only dream about the past.  I will
never become a part of the city, I know too much about the real world.  The
blue robots will keep me away from the ordinary people forever.
  The  sun  arises  from  the polluted horizon and places once again a thin
film of sweat on my face.
