                   "A THEORY OF JUSTICE - THE GAME SHOW"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


                 My best regards to the original position.



       Since  it was not the most popular game show on television, the
     Dare  Devil  Show  was  only broadcasted on late Sunday evenings.
     Most  of  the  people  had  no  interest  in  programs  that  was
     dedicated  to politics, and a game show that had no luxury prizes
     for everyone was doomed to be boring.
       Even  if  only a few  people  watched it,  the Dare  Devil show
     could not be stopped.
       Wrapped  in  a black plastic bag, the individual was brought on
     stage.   No  audience  applauded,  no hysterical man dressed in a
     pink suit screamed for more.  The individual was unconscious, his
     mind  had  been  erased of all knowledge of himself.  He (or she,
     but  probably he) was still a rational human being, but not aware
     of  it  at  the  moment.   The  individual  was  under  a veil of
     ignorance.  The game would soon begin.
       The  black  bag  was slowly carried over the almost empty stage
     until  they  reached  the  middle  of  it.  No one smiled, no one
     expressed any feelings at all.  The bag was left on the stage and
     lay there like a dead animal for a few seconds.
       Welcome to the Dare Devil show.  You do not know who you are or
     what  you  are.   But  you  are not dumb.  You can speak and make
     decisions.  That is the point in this game.
       The black bag moved a little.
       You  are  about to construct a few principles about the present
     society.   When  you  are  finished,  we  will  let  you  out and
     re-insert  your memory  together  with your feelings.  You do not
     know  who you are as a person in this society.  Your task will be
     to play the game as well as possible.  A failure will strike back
     at you.  Success will help you.
       I  understand,  the  voice  said  from  inside  the  bag on the
     metallic  stage.  I have fully understood the rules and the point
     with this.  Give me five minutes to think.
       They  gave  the individual ten minutes.  That was the standard.
     Only  a few persons felt excited during those minutes.  You could
     count them on your fingers.
       After  seven minutes and four seconds, the voice was once again
     heard from inside the black plastic bag.  His words echoed in the
     almost empty room.
       I  have  two principles, the voice said.  The first one is that
     every  individual  should  have  the  right  to  all personal and
     political  rights.   For  example;  private  property, freedom of
     speech,  education and the possibility to reach high positions in
     society.   My  second  one cannot be brought out unless the first
     principle  works  smoothly.  Social and economical inequality can
     be  accepted only if the other alternatives would lead to greater
     inequality.  These are my principles.
       A  few  people wrote the principles down.  You could count them
     on  your  fingers.   They  turned  their  TV  off, rushed through
     corridors  and  placed  their  notes  on a table in a great room.
     Black  suits, expensive ones, everywhere you looked.  What are we
     going  to  do,  they  said  to each other.  Can we accept them as
     principles  for our society?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  We will just
     have  to  try  them  out  before  we decide if we are going to do
     another  show  next  week.   We  cannot stop the Dare Devil Show,
     someone   said.   This  is  the  only  place  common  people  can
     participate in the big decisions about our society, our situation
     and  lifestyle.  We just have to keep it going until we reach the
     final  stage.  The stage when we finally find the principles that
     work.   This  is  the twentieth century,  we cannot trust destiny
     any  more when it comes to ourselves as future history.  Look how
     it  worked out before.  It did not work very well.  Our future as
     happy people depends upon the Dare Devil Show.  The future of our
     children.  Everybody need this show.  Some day, there will be the
     perfect  principles for the perfect society.  The show must go on
     until that day.
       Two people opened up the plastic bag.
       Excellent my friend, the speaker said.  Welcome out of the bag,
     Mr  John.  We thank you for your participation in this game show.
     If you are not satisfied with your prize, do not be sad.  This is
     only a game show.
       The  few  people  who  had  written  down  his  principles  and
     discussed them turned to the TV.
       Sure, they said.  This is only a game show.
