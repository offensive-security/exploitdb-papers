*   The intro.           "Super Bowl XXVIII !!"

    True, them christmas presents were nice, but what can be nicer than
    a batch of crispy and fresh uXu files? :) Okay, stop that and go on
    with the show! Yes! Another productive month - with loads of stories
    from The GNN this time, a new contributor submission from BLaZe and
    a little nonsense from The Chief and a rare swedish file from another
    new contributor wraps up this month's release. Be sure to check out
    our new distribution sites if you have a chance as well - they are
    always packed with good text files!

    Side note: In case you get a call from "Phearless", be aware that it
    is not _Phearless_ who calls. He will not be able to call outside
    Sweden for a while (we'll let you know when he is, though).
    

    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?

    Bud! All files (0-172) are available from the sites listed at the end
    of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 009,011,161,125,063

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are stars (or
    multiplication characters) which let you know what's new since
    last time. You don't have to read through the whole index for
    the latest info, just scan the file for the stars.


                                              Another one for the road
                                                       The Chief / uXu

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file and leave
   private mail to The Chief for further information (if needed) or to
   let us know you'd like to join. Don't hesitate! Call today!
   'netters -> E-Mail The Chief (check address at the end of the file).


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.
                      Password protected files are okay too.

December  January  December  January  December  January Releases 1994:

161: "An Amazing Christmas Tale" by The GNN.   The way people make it
worth the hassle. For what? Why do you need the dough when you're
retired? Everyone saves enough money today, so they can spend it when
they're 70? What fun is that? It's not what this story is about, but
read it anyway.

162: "The Man Behind" by The GNN.   This one will be a classic! "A
genuine GNN!" they will say when you find it in the window of an
old crummy antique store. Never will you forget the words, the story.
And that is a promise. Highly recommended chilly reading.

163: "Bob - The Serial Killer" by The GNN.   The only place you'll
ever be able to read about Bob _is_ right here. Yes, that's right.
Oh, but you haven't been properly introduced, have you? Say hello
to Bob. You'll be surprised.

164: "How To Make a Bomb!" by The GNN.   One for the road, you say?
I don't think so. Seen this one before, you say? I do not think so.
Tired of those recipes that flood the e-zines and newsgroups throughout
the wrinkled computerized anarchy mecca? Then read this one.

165: "We Love You, Pigs!" by The Chief.   The thought behind this one
from the start was a joke, sort of. Writing about the way cops do their
thing - ought to be funny huh? Well maybe not.

166: "Interrogation" by The GNN.   Feeling low? Want to do something
fun? Are you stuck in your ways? Fuck, this sounds like a soda
commercial. I'm sick sick sick of it. This one's about an interrogation
if you didn't catch that. And it's dead serious.

167: "Red Team" by The GNN.   Now, here's a story about a killer. One
who used to work for _them_. What happened? Why does it say _used to_
work? Hmm, there must be a reason, and yes, you are right. Read on
and find out.

168: "10 Ways To Cause Havoc in Public Toilets" by BLaZe.   Yes! Ten
different tips that'll help your ass when you're close to the bowl
from our recent_and_very_new contributor BLaZe. Ain't that somethin'?

169: "The Stand" by The GNN.   A place where you're allowed to be.
Allowed? What keeps you from leaving that place? Is something, or
someone deciding for _you_ ? Ahem, well, this has something to do
with this story, sort of anyway. A GNN thang.

170: "A Theory of Justice - The Game Show" by The GNN.   At one stage
in the years of the human race, there will be someone who wants to
know what's going on behind the scenes. Politics, of course, but when
they don't work, (and quite frankly, have they ever?) what will happen?

171: "Five Stories From The Metaphysical Workshop" by The GNN.   I
think I'll let you describe this one by yourselves. It is not an
easy task, as it is five stories in one, but I think you will
be pleased and happy with all of them.

172: "uXu Index #15" by The Chief.   The filled-to-the-limit index
with the usual ingredients. What did you call it? Useless? Wonderful?
Nothing! Bah. So much for participating. The index (as you surely know
by now) contains information, general statistics and some other stuff
we make up ourselves. A couple of 'em are listed below:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks and Honorary Member List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact uXu.

      [#172 also includes an ndex for the uXu-S and DSR series]
