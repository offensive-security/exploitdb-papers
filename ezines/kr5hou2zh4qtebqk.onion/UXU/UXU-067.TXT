          [ Complete Listing Of The Doors' Lyrics - By: Quiksilver ]
            [ A Tribute To One Of The Greatest Bands Of All Time ]
==========================================================================

Being a dedicated Doors/Jim Morrison fan, I jumped at the opportunity to
purchase a copy of "The Doors; The Complete Illustrated Lyrics", which
contained excellent commentary on the doors, and their songs, along with
the lyrics to all the songs on all the albums below, something I couldn't
pass up.  I figured I would compile all these songs together in text format,
and share it with other users. For those who also admire The Doors and Jim
Morrison's works, I highly recommend the book, it's worth the price.

Below is a listing of all the albums covered, the songs on each album,
and their respective author.  There is a header at the top of each file
naming the album it is found on, author, and the song name for convenience.

                                  Enjoy.

[Title....]: Break On Through
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide.
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

We chased out pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
Can you still recall
The time we cried?
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Ev'rybody loves my baby
Ev'rybody loves my baby

She gets, she gets
She gets, she gets

I found a island in your arms
A country in your eyes
Arms that chain
Eyes that lie
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Made the scene from week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
The gate is straight
Deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through

Break, break
Break, break
Break

[Title....]: Soul Kitchen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I'd really like to stay here all night

The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights shed their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise

Still one place to go
Still one place to go

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitcken
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumbling in the neon groves

Your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Learn to forget, learn to forget

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumbling in the neon groves

Well the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now, I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here all night
All night
All night

[Title....]: The Crystal Ship
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss
Another kiss

The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again
We'll meet again

Oh tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry
I'd rather fly

The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back
I'll drop a line

Well, she's fashionably lean
And she's fasionably late
She'll never rank a scene
She'll never bring a date
But she's no drag
Just watch the way she walks

She's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox

No tears, no fears
No ruined years
No clocks
She's a twentieth century fox

She's thw queen of cool
And she's the lady who waits
Since her mind left school
It never hesitates
She won't waste time
On elementary talk

'Cause she's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
Got the world locked up
Inside a plastic box
She's a twentieth century fox, yeah
Twentieth century fox.
Twentieth century fox, yeah
She's a twentieth century fox

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And out love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire

Take the highway to the end of the night
End of the night

Take a journey to the bright midnight
End of the night

Realms of bliss

Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to the endless night

End of the night

Time to live
Time to lie
Time to laugh
Time to die

Take it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast if you want your love to last
You've been movin' much too fast

Time to walk
Time to run
Tume to aim your arrows
At the sun

Take it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast if you want your love to last
You've been movin' much to fast

Go real slow
You'll like it more and more
Take it as it comes
Specialize in havin' fun

Take it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move to fast if you want your love to last
Movin' much to fast
Movin' much to fast

[Title....]: The End
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend
The end of our elaborate plans
The end of ev'rything that stands
The end

No safety or surprise
The end
I'll never look into your eyes again

Can you picture what will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land

Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the king's highway
Weird scenes inside the goldmine
Ride the highway west, baby

Ride the snake
Ride the snake
To the lake
To the lake

The ancient lake, baby
The snake is long
Seven miles
Ride the snake

He's old
And his skin is cold
The West is the best
The West is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest

The blue bus is calling us
The blue bus is calling us
Driver, where are you taking us?

The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall

He went to the room where his sister lived
And then he paid a visit to his brother
And then he walked on down the hall
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
Father?
Yes, son?
I want to kill you
Mother, I want to...

Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus

This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend
The end

It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me

The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die

This is the end

[Title....]: Strange Days
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strange days have found us
Strange days have tracked us down
They're goin' to destroy our casual joys
We shall go on playing or finding a new town

Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning
Her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin and you know this is it

Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone

Unhappy girl
Left all alone
Playin' solitaire
Playin' warden to your soul
You are locked in a prison of your own device
And you can't believe what it does to me
To see you cryin'

Unhappy girl
Tear your web away
Saw thru all your bars
Melt your cell today
You are caught in a prison of your own device

Unhappy girl
Fly fast away
Don't miss your chance
To swim in mystery
You are dying in a prison of your own device

[Title....]: Horse Latitudes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the still sea conspires an armor
And ehr sullen and aborted
Currents breed tiny monsters
True sailing is dead

Awkward instant
And the first animal is jettisoned
Legs furiously pumping
Their stiff green gallop
And heads bob up
Poise
Delicate
Pause
Consent
In mute nostril agony
Carefully refined
And sealed over

[Title....]: Moonlight Drive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's swim to the moon
Uh huh
Let's climb thru the tide
Penetrate the evenin' that the city sleeps to hide

Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Uh huh
Let's climb thru the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds that lap against our side

Nothin' left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb thru the tide
You reach a hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide

Easy to love you as I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive
Moonlight drive

C'mon baby gonna take a little ride
Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down, down, down

People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No on remembers your name

When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name

When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

Stand in your door
Meet inside
Show me some more
Show me some more
Show me some more

My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
Turn and stare
Fix your hair
Move upstairs
Move upstairs
Move upstairs

My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
Free from disguise
Gazing on a city
Under television skies
Television skies
Television skies

My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
Eyes have seen you

Memorize your alleys
On an endless roll
Endless roll
Endless roll

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't see your face in my mind
I can't see your face in my mind
Carnival dogs consume the lines
Can't see your face in my mind

Don't you cry
Baby
Please don't cry
And don't look at me with your eyes

I can't seem to find the right lie
I can't seem to find the right lie

Insanity's horse adorns the sky
Can't seem to find the right lie

Carnival dogs consume the lines
Can't see your face in my mind

Don't you cry
Baby
Please don't cry
I won't need your picture
Until we say goodbye

When the music's over
When the music's over here
When the music's over
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

When the music's over
When the music's over
When the music's over
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

For the music is your special friend
Dance on fire as it intends
Music is your only friend
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end

Cancel my subscription to the resurrection
Send my credentials to the house of dentention
I got some friends inside

The face in the mirror won't stop
The girl in the window won't drop
A feast of friends alive she cried
Waiting for me outside

Before I sink into the big sleep
I want to hear
I want to hear
The scream of the butterfly

Come back, baby
Back into my arms

We're getting tired of hangin' around
Waiting around
Wit out heads to the ground

I hear a very gentle sound
Very near
Yet very far
Very soft
Yet very clear
Come today
Come today

What have they done to the earth?
What have they done to out fair sister?

Ravaged and plundered
And ripped her
And bit her
Stuck her with knives
In the side of the dawn
And tied her with fences
And dragged her down

I hear a very gentle sound
With your ear down to the ground --
We want the world and we want it,
We want the world and we want it, now
Now? NOW!

Persian night! Babe
See the light! Babe
Save us!
Jesus!
Save us!

So when the music's over
When the music's over, yeah
When the music's over, yeah
Turn out the light
Turn out the light

For the music is your special friend
Dance on fire as it intends
Music is your only friend
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end

So when the music's over
When the music's over, yeah
When the music's over, yeah
Turn out the light
Turn out the light

Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hell, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

She's walkin' down the street
Blind to ev'ry eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?

Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song

Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you fool?

Do you hope to pluck this disky jewel?
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
I want you
I need you
Love
Love
Hello

She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens

She has robes and she has monkeys
Lazy diamond studded flunkies
She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

I see you live on Love Street
There's the store where the creatures meet
I wonder what they do in there
Summer Sunday and a year
I guess I like it fine, so far

She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and a garden
I would like to see what happens

La, la, la, la, la, la

[Title....]: Not To Touch The Earth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not to touch the earth
Not the see the sun
Nothing left to do but run run run
Let's run
Let's run

House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Come on, baby, run with me
Let's run

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

Dead President's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not goin' very far
To the East to meet the Czar

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

Some outlaws live by the side of a lake
The minister's daughter in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl, we're almost home
We should see the gates by morning
We should be inside by evening

Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Soon, soon, soon
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you
Soon
Soon
Soon
I am the Lizard King
I can do anything

Where will we be
When the summer's gone?

Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night we swam the laughin' sea

When summer's gone
Where will we be?
Where will we be?
Where will we be?

Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night we swam the laughin' sea

When summer's gone
Where will we be?

Summer's almost gone
We had some good times
But they're gone

The winter's coming on
Summer's almost gone

Wintertime winds blow cold this season
Fallin' in love I'm hopin' to be
Wind is so cold
Is that the reason
Keeping your warm, your hands touching me

Come with me
Dance, my dear
Winter's so cold this year
You are so warm
My wintertime love to be

Wintertime winds blue and freezin'
Comin' from the northern storms in the sea
Love has been lost
Is that the reason
Trying so desperately to be free

Come with me
Dance, my dear
Winter's so cold this year
You are so warm
My wintertime love to be

Come with me
Dance, my dear
Winter's so cold this year
You are so warm

Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older

The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn, living
Living, dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

And it's all over for
  the unknown soldier
It's all over for the unknown soldier

"Company, halt!"

"Present Arms"

Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder

The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn, living
Living, dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

It's all over
The war is over

Lost in the sea

In the mountains of Spain

Again and again
Take me

My wild love went riding
She rode all the day
She rode to the devil
And asked him to pay

The devil was wiser
It's time to repent
He asked her to give back
The money she spent

My wild love went riding
She rode to the sea
She gathered together
Some shells for her hair

She rode and she rode on
She rode for a while
Then stopped for an evening
And laid her head down

She rode on to Christmas
She rode to the farm
She rode to Japan
And re-entered a town

By this time the weather
Had changed one degree
She asked for the people
To let her go free

My wild love went riding
She rode for an hour
She rode and she rested
And then she rode on

May take a week and it may take longer
They got the guns but we got the numbers
Gonna win
Yeah, we're takin' over
Come on

Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening crawl across the years
You walk across the floor with your flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trading your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it, baby
In our prime
Get together one more time

Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time

Well c'mon honey
Get along home and wait for me
Baby, I'll be home in just a little while
Y'see, I gotta go out in this car with these people
And get fucked up

Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time

Love you girl

Lookin' real good

There will never be another one
Like you
There will never be another one who can
Do the things you do, Oh
Will you give another chance?
Will you try a little try?
Please stop and you'll remember
We were together
Anyway

All right!

And, if you have a certain evening
You could lend to me
I'll give it all right back to you
Know how it has to be, with you
I know your moods
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And you're mine

Will you stop and think and wonder
Just wnat you'll see
Out on the train-yard
Nursing penitentiary

It's gone
I cry
Out long

Did you stop to consider
How it will feel,
Cold grindin' grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper
In Saturday's shore
The whole world's a savior,
Who could ever ever ever ever ever ever
Ask for more?

Do you remember?
Will you stop
Will you stop, the pain?

There will never be another one
Like you
There will never be another one who can
Do the things you do, Oh
Will you give another chance?
Will you try a little try?
Please stop and you'll remember
We were together
Anyway

All right

How you must think and wonder
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you're on the field

I'm alone for you
And I cry

"He's sweatin', look at him... optical promise...
 you'll be dead and in hell before I'm born...
 sure thing...bridesmaid... the only solution.
 Isn't it amazing?"

Like polished stone

I see your eyes
Like burning glass

I hear your smile
Smile babe

My fingers would explore
The costume of control
Excitement soon unfolds

Seize the summer in your pride
Take the winter in your stride

You're our child
Screamin' wild

With hunger at her heels
And freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Staring
Into

Wild child
Full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face
Your cool face
Your cool face

Remembering when it was easy
Try it again
Much to easy -- remembering when

All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walkin' blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the runnin' blues

Well, I've got the runnin' blues
Runnin' away, back to L.A.
Go to find the dock on the bay
Maybe find it in L.A.

Runnin' scared, runnin' blue
Goin' so fast, what'll I do?

Well, I've got the runnin' blues
Runnin' away, back to L.A.
Got to find the dock on the bay
Maybe find it in L.A.

Sun is shining deep beneath the sea
But not enough for you and me and sunshine

Love to hear the wind cry

Wishful sinful, our love is beautiful to see

[Title....]: The Soft Parade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I was back there in seminary school
There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer

Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide
Can you find me soft asylum
I can't make it any more
The man is at the door

Peppermint miniskirts, chocolate candy
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy

There's only four ways to get unraveled
One is to sleep and the other is to travel

One is a bandit up in the hills
One is to love your neighbor till
His wife gets homme

Catacombs, nursery bones
Winter women growing stones
(Carrying babies to the river)

Streets and shoes, avenues
Leather riders selling news

(The monk bought lunch)

Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
Gentle street where people play
Welcome to the soft parade

All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
Must be something else we say
Somehow to defend this place
(Everything must be this way, everything must be this way.)

The soft parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
A cobra on my left
Leopard on my right

Deer woman in a silk dress
Grils with beads about their necks
Kiss the hunter of the green vest
Who has wrestled before
With lions in the night

Out of sight

The lights are getting brighter
The radio is moaning
Calling to the dogs
There are still a few animals
Left out in the yard
But it's getting harder
To describe
Sailors
To the underfed

Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
What got us this far
To this mild Equator
We need someone or something new
Something else to get us through

Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
Calling in the dogs
Calling all the dogs
Calling on the gods

Meet me at the crossroads
Meet me at the edge of town
Outskirts of the city
Just you and I
And the evening sky
You'de better come alone
You'd better bring your gun
We're gonna have some fun

When all else fails
We can whip the horses' eyes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who scared you, why were you born, my babe
Into time's arms with all your charms, my love
Why where you born, just to play with me
To freak out or to be beautiful, my dear

Load your head, blow it up, feeling good, baby
Load your head, blow it up, feeling good, baby

Well, my room is so cold you know you don't have to go, my babe
And if you warm it up right, I'm gonna love you tonight, my love
Well, I'm glad that we came, I hope you're feeling the same
Who scared you and why were you born, please stay

I see a rider coming down the road
Got a burden carrying a heavy load
One save of silver and one bag of gold

When I woke up this mornin'
I got myself a beer
When I woke up this mornin'

Let it roll, baby, roll

At first flash of Eden we raced down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore

Waiting for the sun

Can't you feel it, now that spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

This is the strangest life I've ever known

Can't you feel it, now that spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

Make me free, love

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets of the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it's following me

Just about the break of day
She came, then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

Blood on the streets runs a river of sadness
Blood in the streets, it's up to my thigh
The river runs down the legs of the city
The women are crying red rivers of weeping

She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile egg-shell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of phantastic L.A.

Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets of the town of Chicago
Blood on the ride, it's following me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grandma loved a sailor who sailed the frozen sea
Grandpa was that whaler and he took me on his knee
He said "Son, I'm goin' crazy from livin' on the land
Got to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sands"

This old man was graceful, with silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and he walked our country miles
Sining songs of shady sisters and old time liberty
Songs of love and songs of death and songs to set men free

I've got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead

Land ho

Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five
Gonna skin that little girl alive

If I get my hands on a number two
Come back home and marry you
Marry you
Marry you
All right

Save the blind tiger

Black dressed in leather

She was a princess
Queen of the highway

Now they are wedded
She is a good girl
Naked as children
Out in the meadow
Naked as children
Wild as can be
Soon to have offspring
Start it all over
Start it all over

American girl
Most beautiful people in the world
Son of a frontier Indian swirl
Dancing thru the midnight whirl-pool
Formless
Hope it can continue a little while longer

You know they are a liar

I want to tell you about Texas Radio and the big beat
It comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow, with precision, with a back beat
Narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others, mean and rueful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have contructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died

The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
And they are saying
"Forget the night! Live with us in forest of azure
 Out here on the perimeter, there are no stars
 Out here we is stoned--immaculate"

Listen to this I'll tell you about the heataches,
I'll tell you about the heartaches and the loss of God
I'll tell you about the hopeless night
The meager food the souls forgot
Tell you about the maiden with wrought iron soul

I'll tell you this
No eternal reward can forgive us now
For wasting the dawn

I'll tell you about Texas Radio and the big beat
Soft-driven, slow and mad like some new language

Now listen to this I'll tell you about Texas
I'll tell you about Texas Radio
I'll tell you about the hopeless night
The wanderin' the Western dream
Tell you about the maiden with wrought iron soul

With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin

Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about th begin!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?

The snake was pale cold, glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
Thee sheets were hot dead prisons

And she was beside me, old she's known, young
Her dark red hair, the white soft skin

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look! She's coming in here
I can't live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once I had a little game
I likedd to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called "Go insane"

Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes, forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple

This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes, no way to lose
And I'm right here, I'm going too
Release control, we're breaking through

[Title....]: The Celebration Of The Lizard: The Hill Dweller
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way back deep into the brain
Way back past the realm of pain
Back where there's never any rain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us

And in the labyrinth of streams beneath the
Quiet unearthly presence of
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights

Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
A beast locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust blinds under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug with semen
Eyes in their nipples

Wait! There's been a slaughter here

Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town
We're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come!

[Title....]: Not To Touch The Earth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not to touch the earth, not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but run, run, run
Let's run, let's run

House upon the hill, moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze
Come on, baby, run with me
Let's run

Run with me, run with me, run with me
Let's run

The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on alone, not going very far
To the east to meet the Czar

Run with me, run with me, run with me
Let's run

Some outlaws live by the side of a lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home, yeah

Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you soon...soon...soon!

I am the Lizard King
I can do everything

We came down from forests and falls
We came down from Carson and Springfield

Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade

Now I have come again to the land of the fair
And the strong and the wise

Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of the night
Who among you will run with the hunt?

Now night arrives with her pueple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your freams
Tommorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And out love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

It was the greatest night of my life
although I still had not found a wife
I had my friends right there beside me
We were close together

We tripped the wall
We scaled the graveyard
Ancient shapes were all around us
The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog
Two made love in an ancient spot
One chased a rabbit into the dark
A girl got drunk and balled the dead
And I gave empty sermons to my head
Cemetery, cool and quiet
Hate to leave your sacred lay
Dread the milky coming of the day

Time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire

Alright! Alright! Alright!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Spoken Intro]

I wanna tell you about Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps, cool and slow
With a back beat, narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others mean and rueful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
Well, this is the land where the Pharaoh died

Children
The river contains specimens
The voices of singing women call us on the far shore
And they are saying:
Forget the night
Live with us in forest of azure

Meager food for souls forgot

I'll tell you this...
No eternal reward will forgive us now
For wasting the dawn

And one morning you awoke
And the strange sun
And opening your door...

[Title....]: The End
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come on, turn the lights out, man
Turn it way down
Hey Mister Lightman
You gotta turn those lights way down, man!
Hey, I'm not kidding, you gotta turn the lights out
Come on!
What do we care...?

This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my ownly friend, the end
Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again

Can you picture what will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land
Come on, baby!

And we were in this house and there was a sound like
  silverware being dropped on linoleum, and then
  somebody ran into the room and they said
 "Have you seen the accident outside?"
And everybody said:
 "Hey man, have you seen the accident outside?"

Have you seen the accident outside
Seven people took a ride
Six bachelors and their bride
Seven people took a ride
Sever people died

Don't let me die in an automobile
I wanna lie in an open field
Want the snakes to suck my skin
Want the worms to be my friends
Want the birds to eat my eyes
As here I lie
The clouds fly by

Ode to a grasshopper...
I think I'll open a little shop,
A little place where they sell things
And I think I'll call it "Grasshopper"...

I have a big green grasshopper out there
Have you seen my grasshopper, mama?
Looking real good...
(Oh, I blew it, it's a moth)
That's alright, he ain't got long to go, so we'll forgive him.

Ensenada
The dog crucifix
The dead seal
Ghosts of the dead car sun
Stop the card
I'm getting out, I can't take it
Hey, look out, there's somebody coming
And there's nothing you can do about it...

The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he...he walked on down the hallway, baby
Came to a door
He looked inside

Father?
Yes, son?
I wanna kill you
Mother...I want to...
Fuck you, mama, all night long
Beware, mama
Gonna love you, baby, all night

Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Meet me at the back of the blue bus
Meet me at the back of the blue bus,
Blue rock,
Blue bus,
Blue rock
Blue bus.

Kill! Kill!

This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend, the end
Hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft cries
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end

Is everybody in?
              Is everybody in?
                            Is everybody in?
                                          The ceremony is about to begin

                                          WAKE UP

Awake                                     You can't remember where it was
                                          Had this dream stopped?

Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and the voices are all around us
Choose, they croon, the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances

[Dawn's Highway]

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crows the young child's fragile eggshell mind.

Me and my--ah--mother and father--and a
grandmother and a grandfather--were driving through
the desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian
workers had either hit another car, or just--I don't
know what happened--but there were Indians scattered
all over the highway, bleeding to death.
  So the car pulls up and stops.  That was the first time
I tasted fear.  I musta' been about four--like a child is
like a flower, his head is just floating in the
breeze, man.
  The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking
back--is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead
Indiands...maybe one or two of 'em...where just
running around freaking out, and just leaped into my
soul.  And they'er still in there.

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.

Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
Blood on the ride, it's following me

Indian, Indian what did you die for?
Indian says, nothing at all.

[Newborn Awakening]

Gently they stir, gently rise
The dead are newborn awakenings
With ravaged limbs and wet souls
Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement
Who called these dead to dance
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand?
Was it the wilderness children?
Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly?
I called you up to anoint the earth
I called you to annouce sadness falling like burned skin
I called you to wish you well
To glory in self like a new monster
And now I call on you to pray

[Title....]: To Come Of Age
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A military station in the desert

Can we resolve the past
Lurking jaws, joints of time?
The Base
To come of age in a dry place
Holes and caves

My friend drove an hour each day from the mountains
The bus gives you a hard-on with books on your lap
Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show
They gave out free records to the best couple
Spades dance best, from the hip

[Black Polished Chrome Latino Chrome]

The music was new black polished chrome
And came over the summer like liquid night
The DJ's took pills to stay awake and play for seven days
They went to the studio and someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party and played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun and walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a white rag and smiling coolly drove away
He's rich. Got a big car

My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seductions in cars, abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust
The shoes
Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair

Hey man, you want girls, pills, grass? C'mon...
I show you a good time.
This place has everything. C'mon...
I show you.

[Angels And Sailors]

Angels and sailors
         rich girls
                   backyard fences
                             tents
Dreams watching each opther narrowly
        Soft luxuriant cars
Girls in garages, stripped
          out to get liquor and clothes
          half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer
Jumped, humped, born to suffer
          made to undress in the wilderness

                I will never treat you mean
                Never start no kind of scene
                I'll tell you every place and person that I've been

Always a playground instructor, never a killer
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over
He maneuvered two girls into his hotel room
One a friend, the other, the young one, a newer stranger
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican
Poor boys thighs and buttocks scarred by a father's belt
She's trying to rise
Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games
Handsome lad, dead in a car
Confusion
No connections
Come'ere
I love you
Peace of earth
Will you die for me?
Eat me
This way
The end

                I'll always be true
                Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe
                If you'll only show me Far Arden again

I'm surprised you could get it up
He whips her lightly, sardonically, with belt
Haven't I been through enough? she asks
Now dressed and leaving
The Spanish girl begins to bleed
She says her period
It's Catholic heaven
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck
My chest is hard and brown
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin
We could plan a murder
Or start a religion

[Stoned Immaculate]

                I'll tell you this...
                No eternal reward will forgive us now
                For wasting the dawn

Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused
One summer night, going to the pier
I ran into two young girls
The blonde was called Freedom
The dark one, Enterprise
We talked and they told me this story
Now listen to this...
I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat
Soft driven, slow and mad
Like some new language
Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night
Out her in the perimeter there are no stars

                Out here we is stoned
                Immaculate

                The move will begin in five moments
                    The mindless voice announced
                All those unseated will await the next show

We filed slowly, languidly into the hall
The auditorium was vast and silent
And we seated and were darkened, the voice continued

                The program for this evening is not new
                You've seen this entertainment through and through
                You've seen your birth, your life and death
                You might recall all the rest
                Did you have a good world when your died?
                Enough to base a movie on?

I'm getting out of here!
                                      Where are you going?
To the other side of morning
                                      Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas

        Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand

                                      It's all right, all your friends are here
Where can I meet them?
                                      After you've eaten
I'm not hungry
                                      Uh, we meant beaten

                Silver stream, silvery scream
                Oooooh, impossible concentration

[Curses, Invocations]

Curses, Invocations
Weird bate-headed mongrels
I keep expecting one of you to rise
Large buxom obese queens
Garden hogs and cunt veterans
Quaint cabbage saints
Shit hoarders and individialists
Drag strip officials
Tight lipped losers and
Lustful fuck salesman
My militant dandies
All strange order of monsters
Hot on the trail of the woodvine
We welcome you to out procession

Hewre come the Comedians
Look at them smile
Watch them dance an Indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them they will grow
Watch them waver so
  I'll always be a word man
  Better than a bird man

[Lament]

Lament for my cock
Sore and crucified
I seek to know you
Acquiring soulful wisdom
You can open walls of mystery
Stripshow

How to acquire death in the morning show
TV death which the child absorbs

Deathwell mystery which makes me write
Slow train, the death of my cock gives life

Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry
Taught us god in the child's prayer in the night

Guitar player
Ancient wise satyr
Sing your ode to my cock

Caress its lament
Stiffen and guide us, we frozen
Lost cells
The knowledge of cancer
The speak to the heart
And give the great gift
Words  Power  Trance

This stable friend and the beasts of his zoo
Wild hairs chicks
Women flowering in their summit
Monsters of skin
Each color connects
    to create the board
         which rocks the race
Could any hell be more horrible
               than now
                    and real?

I pressed her thigh and death smiled

Death, old friend
Death and my cock are the world
I can forgive my injuries in the name of
Wisdom  Luxury  Romance

Sentence upon sentence
Words are healing lament
For the death of my cock's spirit
Has no meaning in the soft fire
Words got me the wound and will get me well
If you believe it

All join now and lament for the death of my cock
A tongue of knowledge in the feathered night
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer
I sacrifice my cock on the altar of silence

[The Hitchhiker]

Thoughts in time and out of season
  The Hitchhiker
Stood by the side of the road
And leveled his thumb
In the calm calculus of reason

Hi. How you doin'?  I just got back into town L.A.
I was out on the desert for awhile
  Riders on the storm
Yeah.  In the middle of it
Riders on the storm
Right...
  Into this world we're thrown
When I was out on the desert, ya know
  Like a dog without a bone
  An actor out on loan
I don't know how to tell you
  Riders on the storm
but, ah, I killed somebody
  There's a killer on the road
No...
  His brain is squirming like a toad
It's no big deal, ya know
I don't think anybody will find out about it, but...
  Tale a long holiday
just, ah...
  Let your children play
this guy gave me a ride, and ah...
  If you give this man a ride
started giving me a lot of trouble
  Sweet family will die
and I just couldn't take it, ya know?
  Killer on the road
And I wasted him
  Yeah

[Title....]: An American Prayer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know the warm progress under the stars?
Do you know we exist?
Have you forgotten the keys to the Kingdom
Have you been borne yet and are you alive?
Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
[Have you forgoten the lessons of the ancient war]
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to slaughters by placid admirals
And that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by TV
The moon is a dry blood beast
Guerilla bands are rolling numbers in the next block of green vine
amassing for warfare on innocent herdmen who are just dying
O great creator of being
grant us one more hour to perform our art and perfect our lives
The moths and atheists are doubly divine and dying
We live, we die
and death not ends it
Journey we move into the Nightmare
Cling to life
  Our passion'd flower
Cling to cunts and cocks
  of despair
We got our final vision by clap
Columbus' groin got filled with green death
(I touched her thigh and death smiled)
We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
  and flee the swarming wisdom
  of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
And only one of all the rest
To dance and save us
With the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament
(When the true King's murderers are allowed to roam free a thousand
 Magicians arise in the land)
When are the feasts
we were promissed
Where is the wine
The New Wine
    (dying on the vine)
resident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight and velvet hour
We of arabic pleasure's breed
We of sundome and the night
Give us a creed
To believe
A night of Lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
Hundred hues
a rich mandala
For me and you
And for your silky
pillowed house

A head, wisdom
And a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee
We used to believe
In the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The Things of Kindness
And unsporting brow
Forget and allow
Did you know freedom exists in a school book
Did you know madmen are roaming our prison
within a jail, within a gaol
within a white free protestant
maelstrom
We're perched headlong on the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death on the end of a candle
We're trying for something that's already found us

We can invent Kingdoms of our own
grand purple thrones, those chairs of lust
and love we must, in beds of rust
Steel doors lock in prisoner's screams
and muzak, AM, rocks their dreams
No black men's pride to hoist the beams
while mocking angels sift what seems
To be a collage of magazine dust
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust
This is just jail for those who must
get up in the morning and fight for such
unusable standards
while weeping maidens
show-off penury and pout
ravings for a mad
staff

Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings
The servants have the power
dog-men and their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
(And where were you in our lean hour)
Milking your moustache or grinding a flower?
I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV
Tower, I want roses in
my garden bower; dig?
Royal babies, rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
for the plant that's plowed

They are waiting to take us into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
  comes death on a strange hour
  unannouced, unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings
where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other Kingdom seems by far the best
until its other jaw reveals incest
and loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a Feast of Friends
To the Giant Family
