                                I look away

                             If I look at you

                               you look away

                       No One can get under my skin

                        since I am cold and frozen

                           No One knows anything

                                 about me


                            I used to be water

                              soft and warm?

                               a lake maybe

                            a small river maybe

                             anything you want
