   As a young hacker, I left early for the BIG systems. The small ones   
  didn't last long enough. Soon I had nestled myself into some very big
  systems and found that they were very much like the smaller ones.
  I had to find a REALLY OUTRAGEOUS BIG system, to satisfy my needs...

CHAPTER ONE                                                         CHAPTER ONE
__________________________________SEXY DAUGHTER________________________________

    I was 15. The sun was shining and the grass was green. The neighbors'
sexy 21-year-old daughter, Marielle, licked the sun in a sunchair next to
their swimming pool and our dog "Phileas" chased butterflies. It was the first
day of summer in Charmington where I lived. 

    From my bedroom-window on the second floor, I had the best view in the 
neighborhood. Marielle had a tight body-bikini, and I could see her lying 
there, sweating, the sun licked her body from her head to her toes. I just 
waited for the moment when she would unwrap her bikini, because of the heat, 
and reveal those unreal breasts like she always did. This time though, it 
didn't seem to happen...she was not on time...Well..I'll stick around a 
couple of minutes more, I thought, and waited. 

    The birds sang, the sun burned, almost no wind and the town slept.
My mom and dad were visiting the grandparents and my sister was out with her
friends so this time would be perfect for Marielle to show me her beautiful
body, but nothing happened, and I wondered if she was sleeping...

CHAPTER TWO                                                         CHAPTER TWO
_____________________________SPINGLEMAN'S DILEMMA______________________________

    "Special Computers Designed Here" said the sign by the mailbox. Steven
Spingleman talked on the phone with a Head Executive at GCEC, Government
Computer Engineers Center (see Appendix 1 for more on GCEC).

- That is not ethical to do, said Spingleman with a broken voice.

- Mr. Spingleman...Steve...This isn't my field. You must understand that I
  am but a mere messenger. If I do not follow orders, I will loose my job.
  If you have any objections to this project, you'll just have to talk to
  my superiors. Here...you can call this number if you have any
  trouble or questions.

    Spingleman heard the man, known to him as Mr. Jensen, messing around
in the room, searching for something. Drawers were opened and closed again,
papers lifted and put down again. Finally he came back to the phone.

- Here it is! Ok, Steve...055-381-289662.

    He said the numbers one and one once more to make sure Spingleman got
the number correct.
 
- This number goes directly to the GCE Experiment Center and there you'll
  reach me and my superiors. Just DON'T show this number to anyone, Ok?

    Spingleman thought for a while, and then he decided what to say.

- All right Mr. Jensen. I'll try, but I can't assure you that this will work.
  This is a highly complicated computer you ask for and my experience with
  these sort of projects are but none.

    Spinglemans voice had become nothing but a whisper. It shivered when he
tried to make his way out of the project with a lie.

- Ah, come now, Mr. Spingleman. You know that we know all about you and that
  these sorts of experiments is your speciality, or should I say, WERE your
  speciality.

    Steve Spingleman now realized that he had to go through with it, even
if it was unethical, unreal and very dangerous. If he hadn't..... No. That
was long ago, and he couldn't change the past. He hated GCEC and this Mr.
Jensen who leaved him with no alternative but to do this dirty work for him.

- Mr. Spingleman?

- Yes, I'm still here, said Spingleman. I understand your terms...

- Good. Let's hope that this project will float smoothly and that you'll
  follow my advice. We don't want anything to happen, do we Mr. Spingleman? 
  No.. I didn't think so, Mr. Jensen said, answering his own question. We 
  will contact you if something comes up. Goodbye Mr. Spingleman.

CHAPTER THREE                                                     CHAPTER THREE
_________________________________DAYDREAMING___________________________________

    Daydreaming...that was something for a troubled mind, and right now
my mind WAS troubled. Marielle DIDN'T unwrap her bikini! As a 15-year-
old boy, your mind will undoubtedly be on a constant lookout for girls and
sex. That is a fact, but the average teenager will never have such an oppor-
tunity as I had here with Marielle, so I was known as "The lucky one" among 
my friends.

    Suddenly something happened. Marielle started to move, and my eyes homed
in on my target. Now she sat up in the chair and looked around. Now
I recognize you, my mind said, and opened a memory-bank for storing what
was about to happen. She stood up....and went into the house!...
Memory Error, said my mind and closed the bank. Damn! What was she doing?!
I was ready to give up, and go back to my computer, when she came out again.
 
    She had a sun-lotion bottle in her right hand, walking to the chair
again, but changed her mind at the last moment and walked to a table, which
stood just behind a tree, out of the view from my window. I ran to my sisters
room. The view from that window was better than mine, and a lot closer too.

    She was exercising! Bending over, lifted a leg, made sit-ups and so on.
Fantastic! This was great! When she appeared to be finished, she opened the
sun-lotion bottle and started to rub it on her sun-tanned skin. Then it
happened, and my mind opened about 20 Megabyte for storage at the same time.

    The bikini fell on the ground and I was in heaven. She rubbed the lotion
all over, and took her time doing it. I had the time of my life (consider my 
age will you!). Soon she went back to the sun-chair and I went back to my 
room and the window. Now she was lying there...with only a pair of small 
bikini-trousers covering her fantastic body. If I just had some courage, I 
thought, I would go down and talk to her.

- Hello!

    The sound made me jump. My parents stood in the doorway to my room.

- How has your day been, son, said my father with his big smile.

- You should have been with us! We found two new flower-species so your
  Grandfather now has thirty two different sorts. Isn't that fantastic, mother 
  said in a state of ecstasy.

- Fantastic, I muttered in an attempt to sound excited.

- Well, dinner's ready, said mother on her way out of my room. We bought fried 
chicken at the Drive-in, so hurry before it gets cold.

    To buy drive-in-food is like buying walked-in-shoes. You can wear both.

CHAPTER FOUR                                                       CHAPTER FOUR
_________________________________THE PROJECT___________________________________

    Steve Spingleman jumped by a noise too. The "click" in his ear when Mr.
Jensen hung up. Boy, was he in trouble now! GCEC had ordered a very special
computer from him, because he was the best computer builder when it came to
specialities. This demanded his full attention and skill.

The other customers just had to wait...but for how long? This computer would
take at least 2 years to build even though he already had started on a proto-
type which he had hooked up with one of his own inventions, an XX EXPRESS
digital and optical modem. To have it "on-line", as a service to the customers, 
whom, of course had very special wishes, were for test reasons only because of 
the fact that nothing ever is perfect the first time. Every progress he made,
were added to the prototype for his customers to call-in, look at and try out.

    His customers were not of the "normal" kind, if you can call people
normal these days. No, to mention some of his customers, there were the
State Department, ASA (American Space Agency), YMCA (Yugoslavian Micro
Computer Association), STATE (Soviet Tolerance Approval Technology Engineers)
and GCEC whom I presume you have heard about. All of them had their special 
wants and needs, which Spingleman worked on. Now they had to wait. 

    Spingleman went over to his laboratory to collect the package he had
received from GCEC earlier this Friday. It contained the plans for the
computer and what they wanted it to do for them. The package was a 17 kilo
big box with the word "GOVERNMENT" scattered on all sides. He opened it.

    4 Videocassettes on the HRTV-D (High Resolution TV - Digital) format
with digitally scanned maps of the computer. 2 DAT-C (Compact DAT) Cassettes 
with information and the rest of the 17 kilos was encrypted, filled laboratory-
tubes and paper-discs, a new invention by himself and a big success on the 
market. When there were no trees left anywhere, the World Crisis Federation 
had called to order a new kind of paper, and he made the paper-discs. How they 
looked like? How you used one? It's too complicated to understand, but if you 
are a true knowledge-eater you can look in the dictionary at the end of this
book (Appendix 1).

    He picked up all of it and put it on the big designer-table to study
the maps and read the discs when someone logged onto the his prototype
computer.

CHAPTER FIVE                                                       CHAPTER FIVE
_________________________________METROSPECTIVE_________________________________

    I saw the text on my monitor.

				"ACCESS DENIED"
		      "YOUR DIGITAL NUMBERS DO NOT MATCH"

    Damn. This was one of the new XX EXPRESS modems which could spot the
number and place you called from and had special numbers for access. Well,
the hacker-underground had discussed these modems for a while now so I decided 
to call the 'DRAGONFIRE 84' board to see how far the discussion had come.

    Letters and more letters. It took me twenty minutes to answer all of them
and if you are a knowledgeable modem-user you know how long that is, when using
the automatic answerer! In the Hacker-conference there had finally been a 
breakthrough and a new gear called METROSPECTIVE had been built for breaking
XX EXPRESS modem security systems. I talked to Mr. Farmhouse (the "dad" in the 
area) and he promised to send one the same day.

    I had all of the "pre-desolation" gear from boxes to programs written in
a long gone and "dead" language called Pascal. My friends in the hacker 
community called me "The Collector" for obvious reasons. I was called a lot of 
things back then. New gear and inventions had become standard those days and I 
liked to try them out. The Metro (short for METROSPECTIVE) was brand new. I had 
an XX EXPRESS number, so to try the Metro on it was a must for me. I didn't
have a clue to where I was calling and the unbelievable things that would
happen to me because of my curiosity.

CHAPTER SIX                                                         CHAPTER SIX
_________________________________DEADLY ERRORS_________________________________

    Spingleman looked at the screen. Someone had called, but didn't have the
correct access to enter his system. He should have been worried about it, but
wasn't. Perhaps a "wrong-number" call. That was common these days with the 
complex ISDNS telephone system. 

    When they introduced ISDN in the 1990's, it had been a step forward, but 
the ISDNS (SONIC) had turned out to be a much too complex system for the 
average user. No-one really knew the possibilities of the system because of
the inconvenient and strange deaths of the inventors. Actually, no-one knew
where they had gone! They just disappeared one by one, all of them good 
friends to Spingleman, at the time he worked on the prototype.

    Spingleman went back to his studies with a troubled mind. Tormented by
what he had remembered and the pictures of his friends still in his mind.

    The digital maps on the video-board showed a complete build-up of the
computer GCEC had ordered. Any ordinary person who studied these maps would
have given up after approximately thirty seconds. The complexity of the maps
were total, but Spingleman just took a look at them and saw the errors at once.
This could not be what they wanted?, Spingleman thought for himself. These
errors were small but lethal. If he followed these maps, the computer would 
have taken control over the system within 2 minutes after startup.

    If he used two-headed merentors instead of one-headed ones.....
Spindleman started to re-draw the maps with the videoscan-pen, correcting
what he thought were errors, and he worked through the night.

CHAPTER SEVEN                                                     CHAPTER SEVEN
__________________________________TWO DATES____________________________________

    I was roughly awakened by Phileas, licking my face. I looked at the alarm
clock, it said 11.45 am and I tried to go back to sleep. Suddenly I remembered
that I would receive the Metro today, and that the Electronic Package Service
closed 12.00 Sharp on Saturdays! I got out of bed and was ready to leave for 
the EPS office six seconds later.

    I stumbled up the stairs to the office, pushed the door and the clock
showed 12.00. Just in time! The package, at the size of a micro-stereo, had
arrived. On my way home I met my sister, Angelica, and her friends who were
working on a beach-party, due the same night next to our house.

- Hi bro', Angelica said, goin' to our party tonite? Megan wants to see you,
  you know...

    Angelica had gotten her accent from her surf-friends who lived on the beach
and whom she almost lived with. Megan was one of her friends who (if I may
say so) had had a crush on me for the last few weeks. Though she was one of 
the most beautiful girls I had ever seen, I had never gotten the chance to 
talk to her alone so this could be the perfect opportunity.

- I'll think about it, I said.

    Angelica sat her elbow in my side and went back to her friends with a 
smile on her face. Walking towards the house, I saw Angelica talking to 
Megan, and I got nervous.

    Later that day I connected the Metro to one of the expansion-slots of my 
computer to try it out. Just when I was going to start it the phone rang.
I pressed the "off hook" button and heard....

- The Fourth world war has started.

CHAPTER EIGHT                                                     CHAPTER EIGHT
__________________________________J.C. HARRIS__________________________________

    J.C. Harris was one of the two new-hired engineers at GCEC. His record had
been spotless and his skills on computer-design couldn't be measured. That is
to say that he was one of the best in the country. Right now though, he was 
sitting in an office, waiting for a man known to him as Mr. Jensen, and an 
assignment.

    His thoughts wandered to the time when he was a young enthusiast and
didn't have any problems to handle. He had been the best in his class and had
finished all courses he attended with top grades without any attempts to study.
Nowadays the schools had made efforts in computer-security, and the hackers
efforts in breaking it, but he knew that they couldn't break it. A smile swept
over his face when he thought of his "unbreakable" system.

    Thirty hours. He tasted the two words once more, just to make it under-
standable to himself. Thirty HOURS! That was too unbelievable even to himself.
The computer system then, had been quite simple he remembered, but THIRTY
hours?! He had broken the security-name in just two seconds by looking in the
principal secretary's big black book once when he was left alone in her room.
But the password had been a big barrier. No "usual" password had worked and
nothing you ordinary would try, like the name of their dog, children or mother-
in-Law either.

    Noriegamodular5. When he entered that and it worked, he didn't believe his
eyes. The Sonic planet Noriegamodular5, named after a dictator in central-
America in the 20th century, had been the home-planet of the secretary's little
pet, the grywlow. What a password that was. Phew.. and it took him thirty hours
to figure that out. With the "live" programs of today, that password would have
been halfway to the 99th moon of Trolarian by now. Known to everyone.

    Fifty five seconds later "Mr. Jensen" arrived in his black Mercedes 995 COEC
(Computer Oriented Electric Car). He carried the black suitcase in a steady
grip. His black suit and gloves were made by the JJJ company, the most ex-
pensive designer of clothes, known to be untappable and never torn. The security
system accepted his C-AXS card and opened the big, armed doors revealing a
man, standing, waiting for him. "Mr. Jensen" signaled to the man, who of course
was Harris, to come with him into his office. When Harris had closed the door
behind him, seven guards grabbed him and carried him into a circular shield
and left him there.

CHAPTER NINE                                                       CHAPTER NINE
_______________________________FOURTH WORLD WAR?_______________________________

    "Hi Kev", the voice said.

    "Christ, Matthew, You scared the hell out of me, you know!"

    "I know", Matthew said laughing.

    Since the computer at WCC (World Computer Center) went crazy because
of our 'hacks' and tried to start the Fourth World War, I hadn't been that
active in the hacker-community, but now with a new invention, the Metro,
I couldn't stay out.

    "I saw that you had been on the DRAGONFIRE yesterday, and that the 'Old
     Man', ehrm.. Farmhouse, had supplied you with the Metro, and as usual,
     when You find a new invention, you have a place to try it on, right?"
 
    It was no secret that I tried most of the new stuff for the rest of the
hackers, because of my knowledge (modest remark), and that I usually had more
places to hack on, than the rest of them, but I never leaked! They knew that,
but they didn't give up either...
 
    "Yes, I have a place to try it on, but I can't let you in on it as you
     probably already have guessed as usual, Matthew."

    "Ah, come on Kev", Matthew said in a beggar's voice, "You know that I
     never, and I mean NEVER spread anything I get from you, don't you?"
 
    "Yes I know......", I said, and tried to continue.

    "...So, what's the problem, Kev?"

    "I haven't tried it yet! I just got the damn thing you know, and I would
     have tried it, but you called and interrupted me!", I said.

    "Yeah?", Matthew said. "You'll let me in on it later then, right?"

    "Sure", I said, trying to get him off the line. "I'll let you in on it
     later, okay?"

    "Ok, fine! I knew you wouldn't forget your old pal! I call you tomorrow
     and then we can talk, ok?"

    "Bye Matthew", I said and hung up the phone.

    Jeez! Matthew really was my best friend and pal, but he always wanted to
know and learn everything. I don't say that that is bad, quite the opposite
really, but he had his ways in getting the knowledge he wanted that I didn't
like. Once he bribed a guard at the court-house down town, for letting him
in when it was past open-time, just to check out a State vs State case he
needed for his homework.

         (See appendix 4 for an interesting report on the case.)

CHAPTER TEN                                                         CHAPTER TEN
_________________________SPINGLEMAN'S SECOND DILEMMA___________________________

    "Steven Thomas Spingleman?", said the voice.

    "Yes, that is my name.", said Spingleman to the voice on the phone.

    "I'm sorry" said the voice, "Let me introduce myself. Joe Galibrero,
     WSA engineer, clearance code 1273482-2371. We have a little problem
     down here, and you were the only one we could think of calling for
     This kind of problem."
 
    "Spingleman, 881212C-E126.", Spingleman said. 
    "What is your problem, Galibrero?"

    "I can't tell you over the phone, but one of our cars will pick
     you up in about.. 2 minutes. This is classified as 2xtop secret
     and will release you from all your current projects, no matter
     what clearance, importance or status they have, this is more
     important. You have clearance 981-127-12UC for this one Steven."

    Spingleman understood the importance immediately. UC! That meant
    it was an Universal Crisis. He entered the code into his personal
    security system, and got the message:

  --                                                                --
      World Space Association, CODE 981-127-12UC. - TOP PRIORITY -
      Universal Clearance: 127
      Universal Crisis   : 12
  --                                                                --

  The Universal Clearance code 127 meant it topped all other codes by 1.
  (Highest code known was 126), but the Universal Crisis code 12 was new
  to Spingleman. He didn't know what that meant.

    "Ok, I'm ready.", said Spingleman as he hung up. 

    He was just closing his safe, where he had placed all of the plans for
    the GCEC project, when the car arrived. Spingleman closed the front-
    door behind him, made sure it was locked, and got into the car.

    Five minutes later he was on a plane, without knowing its destination.

APPENDIX 1: NAMES AND EXPLANATIONS.                             Vol.1 Version 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASA   - AMERICAN SPACE AGENCY

       The American Space Agency was a branch of the CIA and still is.
       Instead of working all over the world it works only on Tellus.
       After the Sphericals attempt to take Saturn from the Jupitans ,
       each planet had their own Space Agency for preventing this sort
       of crime. Like Interpol in the ancient Europe you might say.



C-AXS CARD - COMPACT ACCESS CARD

       The old access and credit cards were unsafe because they were so 
       easy to copy and use, so the WCF invented the Compact Access Card
       which had a personal coder built into it, so each time you touched
       the card, it felt your temperature, and read your fingerprints, which
       was stored into the card. If the temperature and fingerprints didn't
       match, the card information was transferred to the WCC for checkup
       and the card was useless. If it didn't find any temperature and/or
       fingerprints, the card information was transferred to the WCC for
       checkup and the card was useless. (The only time a card cannot find
       the temperature and/or fingerprints is when the person who holds the
       card has JJJ gloves on his/her hands.) (See JJJ for more information.)

       The WCC checked the information they received and located a match
       with the information in the ASA Computer to get the identity of the
       person that had hold the card, and made investigations on that person.



COEC  - COMPUTER ORIENTED ELECTRIC CAR

       A car that was computer oriented by electric lines added to the
       metal-sides of the roads. Still used in smaller towns on Jupiter-1.
       You entered the town/city you were in, and the destination. The
       computer would then access the road-computer and get the map over
       the town, which was updated every time something happened to the 
       road-network (every second or so), worked out the fastest way and
       took you to your destination.



DAT-C - COMPACT DAT CASSETTES * NEVER TO BE RELEASED *

       Dat cassettes were believed dead, when the industry itself held
       on the design, to prevent illegal copying, and distribution of
       'perfect' copies. When they finally gave up, and released the DAT
       players, the prices killed the sales, so they lowered their prices
       to ordinary Compact Disc player prices, and the sales took a high
       jump. Soon the market was filled with 'perfect' copies of everything.
       The industry stopped the production of new DAT-players but the market
       didn't halt. A 'brilliant' idea of an Engineer at WCF, was to build a 
       Compact Dat player with digital overlays that would stop the illegal
       copying and sell it as any ordinary DAT player, without a word about
       the digital overlays, only that it was 'THE BEST' DAT player ever.
       The customer could trade-in their 'old' DAT player to the new one
       without paying anything in-between, and all of them did! The plan
       worked, and the market of illegal copies came to an end.



EPS   - ELECTRONIC PACKAGE SERVICE

       To get rid of the time-spending mail-service the EPS was formed.
       People got tired of the laziness of the service and that even the
       so called 'special service' or 'we will get your mail to the 
       destination overnight' - service didn't work. The EPS worked in 
       an electronic environment, and the mail was sent with transfer beams.
       You probably have seen the old 'Star Trek' films on the 'remember
       this?' channel, and the beam that they used. The work on such a beam
       was improved when the new Designer's Computer was invented and the
       transfer beam became reality.



GCEC  - GOVERNMENT COMPUTER ENGINEERS CENTER

       The GCEC worked (at the time) close to all research companies in the
       country. They had a special 'deal' with the leading companies in 
       computer technology, to get the best and most reliable computers for
       them, and the cost didn't matter. When they had given one of the
       companies the latest in computer tech, of course there were five new and
       better ones the next day, so they were never out of work. 

       The engineers working at GCEC were those who had gone through life
       with a computer, and the highest grades from the private schools.
       The Executives had different backgrounds. Several of them had their own
       money, but there were some, who had special interests in the company,
       who used the company to get what they wanted, like in any ordinary
       company today.



GCEEC - GOVERNMENT COMPUTER ENGINEERS EXPERIMENT CENTER

       The GCEEC was where the GC Engineers experimented with prototypes and
       other equipment that demanded vacuum rooms, explosion-safe rooms, fire-
       safe rooms, bug-free rooms and a big workshop hall with all the latest
       equipment you could think of back then. If you are a film-freak you 
       probably have seen the ancient James Bond films, and a guy called Q who
       had the job to invent new inventions for the secret agent, James Bond.
       That looked like the workshop hall, but with a neat 1523200 m^2 instead.



HRTV-D - HIGH RESOLUTION TV - DIGITAL

       The advancement in Television technology in the mid 10's made almost
       all new constructions old in a minute or so, so the WCF decided on a 
       last design, that would be world-standard: The HRTV-D. All major
       companies worked together to make this special and last TV. The most
       surprising fact, is that it didn't cost anything. To beat competition
       (which of course still existed) they installed one in every home for
       free. The only thing a viewer would pay, was the licence to the World-
       Net, the Only Tv-Station which had about 5193 different channels and
       was the only one that covered the Outer regions of Crystal Beta.



ISDN/ISDNS - THE COMMUNICATION REVOLUTION

       ISDN was the invention of the 1980-1990's. It revolutionized 
       everything in communications. You were able to send data, speak,
       send messages, view TV, listen to the radio (and so on) with up
       to 256 people/stations at the same time, with One optical cable.
       The only problem with this system, was the Home Equipment you had
       to have to use it. Every person connected to the ISDN system had
       to have an own switch (26x23m), and a control panel, maximum size
       in his/her/its own home. Therefor, the ISDNS system was invented.
       The extra 'S' stands for Sonic, which don't stand for anything
       except a total destruction of the planet it was placed onto.
       It was so fragile for everything else, that it was placed onto
       a planet in the most remote part of the universe. The planet
       was The most silent, and The most unfriendly planet ever to have
       been found. No-one ever wanted to go there, except once.
       A 14-year old kid, called 'Warez d00d', decided to go there,
       just to look at it, and see if he could get some k-rad, awesome,
       k00l games, that he didn't already have, from it. When his ship
       landed, he immediately started to speak to it.
 
       "Do you have....?"  "Have you seen....?"  "k-k00l, d00dz!!!"
       
       (..and so on). The ISDNS accessed its internal megaton-bombs
       after two seconds, and blew up the whole planet. Everything
       was destroyed (including the little 'Warez d00d' except for the
       ISDNS itself, because as you know, it can stand a total destruction
       of the planet it was placed onto. After that, the 'Warez d00d' race
       died out, and was never to be reborn. Later it was said that about
       200.000.000.000.002 Hackers had had a party the same night/day/
       afternoon (in twentysixthousand galaxies) to celebrate what had
       happened.

                       * END OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION *


JJJ COMPANY - JONSON JONSON & JONSON COMANY

       Only The most chic designers, and The most expensive company.
       Johnson, Johnson & Johnson were three brothers. One of them 
       was a cybernoid, the second was a milk bottle, and the third
       had to go to the bathroom. This of course caused many questions.

       'Why did Mr. Johnson have to go to the bathroom?' and
       'Did Mr. Johnson really have straight A's when he left the academy?'.

       These questions are easily answered, with only one word.
       Damn! Spilled my coffee. Alright, where was I, oh right, Mr Johnson.
       Well, after a few internal wars, between the three of them, they
       looked like, frankly speaking, shit! So, they decided to start
       a clothes company, that made clothes that actually Would stand
       a nuclear attack, and still get you into your favorite restaurant
       afterwards, without being rejected by the butler because you 
       weren't dressed for the occasion. They succeeded, and became world-
       famous overnight. Not for their clothes, but for their prices.



M278-EIL - SPECIAL CRIME DEPARTMENT STANDARD EQUIPMENT 61

       The EIL is known as The most trusted Detector of all detectors.
       It detects a body's temperature, from the heir to the toenails.
       (if the body has these features, that is.)
       Mostly used built-in in officer helmets, to recognize a suspect's
       temperature, when questioned. If the body temperature all together
       reach above the standard limit of 38.57827382 degrees celsius
       the person told a lie. Notable: This detector has a record of
       malfunctions. 99% of the malfunctions occurred when questioning
       Government employees. The last % occurred when a small creature
       from the planet AlLIEd-with-all didn't lie for the first time
       in its life.



METRO - METROSPECTIVE INVENTION

       TOO COMPLEX TO DESCRIBE. Size 5x3x2 (cm). Black. Inserted into the
       Hacker-computer's Com-11 port. Faked location and phone number to
       con the XX MISSILE Modem. Now added: Fake fingerprints and eye-
       recognitions possible for use 'at location'.



PAPER-DISC - THE INVENTION THAT SAVED THE WORLD

       The paper disc looked like any ordinary 1.5" disc you would use
       with your computer, the only difference was the material it was
       made of. The 'un-usable' material that the planet Voltar had been
       filled with (jeromium). Because of the massive slaughter of trees
       and the fact that Tellus couldn't live without them, the WCF ordered
       a new kind of paper from all known inventors. Steve Thomas Spingleman
       had worked on a new invention on his 'spare-time' that could be what
       the world needed, the Paper-Disc. He presented it to the WCF and they
       bought it. The only disadvantage was that the WCF got all the credit
       for it, and Spingleman had to be satisfied with the money he got and
       the own satisfaction of knowing that he was the one who came up with
       the idea. 



PDP   - PAPER DISC PLAYER, A WORLD CRISIS FEDERATION INVENTION

       The Paper-Disc Player (PDP) had been invented after the invention of 
       the Paper-Disc. It was generally called a "Video Board" because it
       really was a big screen, designed to take input from a video-pen or
       the keyboard, and output only to the screen.



STATE - THE SOVIET TOLERANCE APPROVAL TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERS

       The STATE is quite undocumented, and I couldn't find any records that
       said it even had existed. Because of the Soviet Union break-up, all that
       was left of Soviet was a small province in the northern Ukraina range
       and there were never anything indicating that they had industries.
       Probably a fake company of GCEC.



T&F   - TEMPERATURE AND FINGERPRINTS

       The scientists of the 'lost' world didn't realize that the temperature
       and the fingerprints of a person could be matched to a unique 
       identifier, unique to each person, but the 21th century scientists did.
       This improved security systems and became world-standard as identifier.
       The ASA had and still has, complete records of each individuals identi-
       fiers and is constantly used by the WCC and other similar security
       companies.



WCC   - THE WORLD COMPUTER CENTER

       In short, the largest Computer-based, Computer-controlled and 
       Computer-run security/standards company. No employees are human,
       because of the security risk they are in themselves. The company
       is run by the WCF, which may seem as a contradiction in terms,
       but is in fact, run by the WCF Main Computer Complex when checked
       deeper down the standard information-channels. Because of the
       massive amount of power the WCF sat on, no-one trusted them,
       and therefor it seemed like the best idea to have the whole show
       run by a computer, which was run by another, and another, and ...



WCF   - THE WORLD CRISIS FEDERATION

       The World Crisis Federation was formed during the Third World War.
       The UN (last active in the 20th century) had started the war over
       never-paid loans and too much difference in opinions.
       The WCF was formed when Tellus was contacted by other life-forms
       during the Third World War, and became a major force in keeping
       law and order and preventing wars. All decisions were made according
       to the World's best, and not as in the UN, according to country.
       This made the WCF accepted as The Judge in world crisis situations.



WSA   - WORLD SPACE ASSOCIATION

       The coordinator of all different Space Agencies. The WSA controlled
       everything in space but nothing on its planets. Each planet had a
       WSA center, always placed where there were the best optical view of
       each planet's own galaxy. For instance, on Tellus, the WSA center
       was placed on an Island called Lunai, not far away from Hawaii.



XX EXPRESS MODEM - THE MODEM OF THE YEAR 2190

       The XX EXPRESS Modem was an invention by the Computer constructor and
       designer Steven Thomas Spingleman in the year 2189. The new extras added
       to this modem was the total ISDNS compability (see ISDN and ISDNS).
       This made the XX EXPRESS modem one of the world's most complicated
       modems. It won the "Modem of the year" contest 2190. The judges words:
       
       "The most beautiful modem this decade..." - H.Wilson, Daily Orbit.

       "Works great.." "A good lookin' modem..." - J.Patrick, Modem Today.

       "Genuine Artwork by the master himself..." - U.Grexz, Uranus Science.
 
       The features of the modem and the ISDNS system made several changes to
       the Hackers way of working. The ISDNS system is shortly described under
       "ISDNS - Phone system of the future". The modem had Signal processing
       features that made the modem "Smarter than You". 

       It recognized where the caller called from with the 5th ISDNS line 
       (loc.line) and displayed it if the owner wanted it. 

       It recognized the phone-number with the 6th ISDNS line (phn.num) and 
       displayed it if the owner wanted it.

       It had a "fingerprint and eye-structure" checker installed for usage
       'on location' as a security system.

       It had a 2086 processor with over 5*10^236 bytes storage space, if the
       owner wanted to use it as a storage device.

       In short, It was a computer itself. If I were to describe all functions
       it would take up the whole section, so I recommend that you try to find
       the paper-disc manual and a paper-disc player at your local pawn-shop
       if you want to know more about it.



XY EXPRESS MODEM - THE NEW VERSION 2270

       NO RECORDS ON THIS MODEL AT THIS TIME. GOVERNMENT SECURITY.



YMCA  - THE YUGOSLAVIAN MICRO COMPUTER ASSOCIATION

       This was Europe's computer industry leader. They handled all
       of Europe's computer trade and worked close with GCEC on design and
       inventions of new equipment and peripherals. When the Soviet Union
       broke up, all of the Eastern countries became free, and the Yugoslavian
       people saw their chance to take the computer market, because of their
       knowledge in the field, and took it. Of course with the help of GCEC
       and their money. Five years later, 2005, the European computer industry
       couldn't compete with the YMCA and were bought up by GCEC and YMCA.

  Subject: Missing Engineers


  Special Crime Department report no sign of the missing engineers, as
  filed by Dr Steven Thomas Spingleman, 2126 South Rodeo Drive, 1271-C
  Inventown. The investigation ends with Dr Spingleman himself, as the
  last person to see these men alive.  The GCEC also reported them
  missing, two days after Dr Spingleman.

  We have no reason to believe they are dead, and no reason to believe
  that they are alive. The only lead we have today, is Dr Spingleman,
  GCEC and possibly the ISDNS system which they built.

  NOTE: When stated officers questioned a Mr Jennings, Project Manager
        at GCEC, 8921 Caluha Offshore, 7892-Z Inventown, we got a 
        clear signal from the heat sensors on the M278-EIL. Probably
        a malfunction.

  Special Crime Department chief M.J Jones hereby suspend this
  investigation with his signature until further information is
  available.
