  They  sat  in  Jim's  old  apartment,  Jim and Charles, drinking whiskey,
smoking  cigarettes and talking about things that people usually talk about
when  they are having a terrible hangover.  They had finished the sport and
the  political  section  of  their  topics  which  as usual led them to the
meaning  of  life.   It  was sunday and a day for tired people.  A day when
people  who  are  trying to cure a terrible hangover talks about absolutely
nothing of value.
  Jim took a sip of his whiskey directly out of the bottle.
  - I guess there is nothing more in life than eating, drinking and failure
nowadays,  he said and froze the moment after when he realized that he knew
what  Charles  was  about to say.  Jim knew and he hated it.  As soon as he
mentioned   something   about  life,  Charles  would  begin  talking  about
determinism.
  -  As  long  as we cannot come up with any arguments why life wouldn't be
causal  and mechanical, I think we just have to accept other thoughts about
our present situation.
  - I knew you were going to say something like that!
  Charles  bent forward and tried to reach the whiskey bottle.  But Jim was
faster and took it away.
  - Listen, Jim said annoyed, we have had this discussion ten times earlier
so why do you bring it up once again?
  - Give me the bottle.  Then let us talk about it for the eleventh time.
  The  strong  liquid  ran down their throats and they prepared for another
verbal war in Jim's old apartment.
  Charles spoke.
  -  The world is mechanical  and  deterministic.  Whatever you do, you are
forced  to  it.   Spinoza  was  right  when  he  said that the world is one
substance  and  not  several,  but  he  was wrong when he claimed that this
substance  was "god".  The  world is  one substance,  from the atomic view.
If  I  drink  whiskey, I never do it out of free will.  The act of grabbing
the  bottle, take it to my mouth and swallow the liquid is predictable - if
we manage to analyze the causal mechanism.  Look at it this way; I take the
bottle  because  I am thirsty.  Why did I get thirsty?  Because I ate food.
Why  did  I ate food?  Because I was hungry.  Why did I choose that special
dinner  to eat?  Because I have heard that it is tasty.  Do you understand?
We never do anything out of completely free will.  We are only bricks in an
enormous  causal  play.   Of  course,  we believe that we do it out of free
will, but in reality we do not.
  Jim spoke.
  -  You  may  be  right.   But your thoughts require more facts.  Why, for
example,  would  everything be mechanical and causal?  Is there any special
reason?   No,  at this moment you fail.  You cannot present any good reason
why  it  should  be  like  this.   Everything has an reason, and it is this
reason  we  must find.  If the reason is unavailable, we would never bother
to look for it.  But we still try, and that makes a causal world wrong.  If
we  can  predict  acts, we can change acts.  When we change acts, we change
your predictable world.  Hence:  The world cannot be completely causal.
  Charles spoke.
  -  There  may  be a reason which we will never be aware of.  Think of the
world as a part of a computer game.  In this game, we are pre-programmed to
do  certain acts without the knowledge of why.  Our acts are logical to the
situation,  therefor  we  do  not question them.  They fit so good into our
world, so we believe that we do them with free will.
  Jim spoke.
  -  That  sounds better.  But this sounds like luxury topics.  If we never
can  understand  or see that we are in a game, why talk about it?  The only
result  we  will  get  to is that everything is without meaning.  If we are
only  pixels in a game, why should we bother to educate us, work and try to
find  a  meaning in our lives?  Your cold scientific view does nothing good
to the human race.  It only creates frustration and confusion.
  Charles spoke.
  -  That  does  not  matter.   Let me try to explain through an fictitious
example.   Imagine  that this world is not externally created.  The...  let
us  call  him the "global programmer" works from within our world.  He sits
somewhere  on our planet, with a computer and creates the world around him.
He  can  see  everything,  he  can  do everything.  He is God.  In the real
world,  he cannot do much.  But from his computer he can change things.  He
is not "someone up there", he is here and we can find him.  He only creates
people  and  material,  but  it  is up to his creations to do whatever they
want.  Then our world would not be causal and predictable in one sense, but
in another way it would be.
  Jim spoke.
  -  I  do not follow you.  How can the world be causal and predictable and
at the same moment not?
  Charles spoke.
  - Well, the "global programmer" does not himself create the beginning and
the  end.   He  just  creates  material,  substance.   He does not create a
predictable  substance,  but  the substance in itself is predictable, if we
can analyze its causal mechanism.
  Jim spoke.
  - Sounds weird.
  A  short  moment  of silence told them that the discussion was over.  The
afternoon was getting late.
  Charles broke the silence.
  -  My  clock screams that the bar has opened downtown.  Why not get there
and see if we find our "global programmer"?
  Jim chuckled.
  - Yeah.  Let's go and make the town stand on its head!
  Charles put down the bottle and they both went to the front door.  But no
one ever opened it and stepped out.
  The global programmer took a deep breath of relief.
