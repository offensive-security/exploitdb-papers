              "We are unique! Truly unique in the universe!"
                                      (Albert Einstein)

  
  2003. Everything was normal. Until.

  They landed all over the planet earth. Great starships, bigger than anything
ever seen. No one expected them. There must have been millions of them,
because wherever there were people, there was a ship. All newspapers and
television stations believed that they were first with the news since
a ship had landed on their lawn too. They never got the chance to send
the news however. Fifteen minutes after they had landed, almost the whole
population of planet earth were sitting in chairs inside the ships, on
their way to unknown places. Left behind were only the disabled and the weak.

  Billions of strange robots had in incredible speed rushed out from the ships
and collected humans. They had carried them out from houses, stores, 
hospitals, offices - wherever there were people. Resistance was hopeless.
The robots couldn't be harmed. 

  Large holes on the outside of the ships sucked the humans inside the ship
and after a long, winding ride placed them in comfortable chairs.
Like fruit in packages, all kinds of people sat beside each other. Many
of them hadn't realized what had happened yet.

  "The President? How nice to meet you!", an old lady said to the well-
dressed man beside her. He looked quite shocked. Understandable, since he
was in a meeting just twenty minutes ago. His guards didn't even get the
chance to reach for their weapons when two robots crashed into the room
and grabbed him. "The russians!", was his first thought.

  Now he, The President, was sitting strapped to a chair in a large room
with all kinds of people. "Large", wasn't enough. The room must have been
several miles. It was shaped as a tube and chairs were placed around it.
The tube must be moving around otherwise the people in the "ceiling" would
have fallen down. Strange. He tried to see the end of the tube in front
of him. Impossible. The space continued forever. He looked upwards. The people
above him looked like flies.

  "Well, how could I know what would happen this day you see a black robot
just ran into my house and dragged me away and what do I see here you 
The president what are you doing here are you also a victim of this..."

  Of course, some old bitch with a streaming mouth, had to be placed on his
left side. He couldn't stand it. 

  "oh yes I have a really bad feeling about this what do you say isn't it
strange just like that V thing that I saw on TV last year hey..."

  But he couldn't do anything about it. Yet. This must be some mistake, 
why had the large ship kidnapped him and some uninteresting citizens?
Was it some kind of experiment? 

  He suddenly froze. Imagine if it were hunters from another world, 
searching for prey. Maybe they had found this world and...and...oh, god!
What if they planned to eat him! Sweat begun to drip from his face.
The ship was moving. 

  Why did he feel so uncomfortable calm? 


  Captain BerZerk and Major Raven sat in the cockpit of the great battle
cruiser "ClockWork II" and waited.  

  "They are on their way now, Captain!"

  Captain BerZerk nodded to Major Raven. Green dots on the radar had 
already informed him about the fact. 

  "Good! Inform them about the situation and send them to the battle area!"

  Captain BerZerk looked through the big window and watched the millions
of stars outside the cruiser. In the distance, he could see the black
ships with the humans closing in. 


  "Listen! Humans!", echoed through the millions of black ships. "In a few
seconds you will receive a battle suit!"

  Plang! Klang! Blong! Before anyone got the chance to react, the suit
was there. Placed over the entire body and a helmet over the head.
Shiny and metallic but not uncomfortable. Now, the President had had
enough. It was time to complain. 
  
  Mong! Rom! Slom! 
 
  Too late.

  "Citizen! In your right hand you now got a weapon! In a few minutes you
will be placed in a red desert! Fire at everything that doesn't look like 
you! It's no idea to give up! They will not take any prisoners! Try to
survive as long as you can! No don't bother trying to fire the gun now!
It's still de-activated! Do not try to commit suicide! It is not possible!
The gun will not fire at yourself!"

  The message was repeated in several languages. The President looked
at the weapon in his hand. Big and blue with a mean trigger placed by his
index finger. He felt like Judge Dredd.

  "Hey!", he screamed to the voice. "You cannot do this! I don't know who
you are but you are doing something incredibly wrong! We are humans!
H-U-M-A-N-B-E-I-N-G-S! WE ARE UNIQUE! We are not warriors in your army!
THIS IS A MISTAKE!"

  But no one heard him.

  A short time later, when he saw the mean creatures running towards him
in the desert he fought for his life.


  "Damn!"

  "I feel a sense of irritation in your voice, Captain?", Major Raven said
with a low voice.

  Captain BerZerk stared at the status-table with the text "You Lose!",
blinking in the middle of it. With a sigh, he leaned back in his seat.
His eyes relaxed on the stars again. Major Raven pushed a button in front
of him. 

  "It seems like our enemies won again. Shall I hail the white flag?"  
  
  Captain BerZerk laughed loud and cruel.

  "Funny! Funny! Just because Earth.V1 turned out to be a planet of wimps?
Bad seed! That's all! Next time we raise a planet of warriors, we only
let them grow for a couple of billion years more! That's all we need to do!"

  Captain BerZerk closed his eyes.

  "Don't forget we got sixteen more of "Planet Earth" to play with!"
