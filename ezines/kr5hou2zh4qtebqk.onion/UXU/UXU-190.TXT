                               "GAS STATION"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


                    A small regard to Robert Graysmith.



  He  could  always be seen chewing a bubble-gum while reading some cartoon
he  had  borrowed  from some shelf in his gas station.  Many people had met
him,  but  few of them had ever learned his name.  Most of them just passed
by, others stopped and bought some gas and stuff from his shop.  Neon signs
and big letters teased the car owners who approached the station and almost
forced them to pull over and meet Bill Lee.
  Bill  Lee  actually hated his Shell gas station but that had not kept him
away  from  it  during the last twenty years.  Every morning at six o'clock
Bill  would  unlock  the  doors,  light  the neon signs and sit down by the
counter,  reading  cartoons  while  awaiting  the  customers.  Outside, the
freeway  would  wake  to  life  and  yet another day with thousands of cars
passing by would begin.
  The  first  customer  arrived ten minutes past six.  A blue volvo stopped
right  outside  the  door.   A young man with sun glasses, despise the fact
that  it  was still dark outside, entered the shop, looking around as if he
expected an enemy to be inside.
  "Hi  there, what can I do for you!" Bill shouted, to indicate that he was
almost deaf but still ready to help anyone.
  The young man pulled out a black pistol from the back of his soiled jeans
and pointed it at Bill.
  "Cash." the man answered with a voice that revealed his drug abuse.
  Bill pretended that he did not see the deadly gun.
  "Right.  Cash.  What do you want to buy with your cash?
  The  young  man  sighed  and cocked the pistol with his thumb.  The click
echoed through the shelves.
  "I want your cash, and I want it now."
  The young man walked towards Bill until the muzzle of the gun was tightly
pressed  against  Bill's  left  cheek.  Bill raised his finger and moved it
slowly in front of his face.
  "I  opened  this  store  ten  minutes ago.  How can you expect me to have
any money other than some coins for change?"
  The  young man lowered his gun a bit, smiled, then he raised it again and
firmly squeezed the trigger.
  There  was  little  noise.   A  seal was created between the skin and the
muzzle  and  the  blast  was  expended  into  the  body tissues.  A conical
perforation  of  the  skull  was  created as the projectile was fired.  The
bullet,  twisting and spiraling, particles of molten metal being thrown off
as  it traveled over a thousand feet per second, created multiple fractures
of Bill's skull.
  In  unison,  the  barrel  slide  of  the  gun recoiled until the barrel's
movement  was  arrested.   Continuing  backward,  the slide passed over the
hammer,  cocked  it,  and  slammed against receiver as the empty casing was
seized  and  ejected  onto the floor of the shop.  The slide sprung forward
again,  peeled  off  the next cartridge from the double-rowed magazine, and
forced it into the chamber.  The gun was ready to be fired again.
  "That  is  not  my  problem,"  the  young  man  said without  any sign of
feelings.   He  turned  around,  checked  that  no one was around before he
placed  the  gun  in  his  jeans again.  A little bell could be heard as he
opened  the door and went to his car.  The blue volvo gently drove away and
disappeared in the crowd of cars on the freeway.
  Bill's  dead  body  lay  on the floor behind the counter.  Streams of red
blood  mixed with grey brain substance slowly made its way out on the floor
around him.
  The next customer arrived half past six.  A black Ford.
  "'ello?"
  It  was  a woman with two kids.  The kids ran around in the shop, chasing
each  other  while  screaming  loud.   The  woman looked around to find any
employee  in  this hell hole of a gas station.  She had just filled her car
with  fuel and would really like to pay for it too.  A good citizen did not
cheat small gas stations, she thought.
  "I will get you!" one of the kids screamed to his friend.
  "Be quiet..." the woman said with a voice that was doomed to be ignored.
  The  woman  looked around, holding her wallet with both hands.  Her mouth
was  open and she understood that something was wrong.  Her suspicious eyes
examined every visible part of the small shop. One of the kids accidentally
ran  into  a  shelf and several bottles of Coke fell to the ground.  One by
one,  the  bottles  were  crushed  against  the concrete.  The brown liquid
splashed around together with pieces of designed glass.
  The  woman stared at the kid who just stood still and watched what he had
done.
  "Oh  shit..." the woman said.  "What have you done?  There must have been
ten bottles on that shelf!"
  "I'm sorry mom," the kid said with a weak voice.
  The  woman  took two gigantic steps against the kid, smacked him with her
fist  before  taking both of the kids in their hands, dragging them against
the  car while repeating over and over again:  "Shit, shit, shit..  hope no
one saw us, I do not want this trip to be more expensive than necessary!"
  The  Ford  quickly  drove  away.   The  two faces of the kids in the back
window  of  the  car  looked  guilty.   The woman would slap herself on the
forehead  and  look guilty too, a couple of hours later when she remembered
that she had forgotten to pay for the gasoline.
  The  sun  went up and shined on the Shell station and the cars that drove
by.   It  was going to be a hot day.  People cursed themselves for the fact
that they had not bought air condition for their cars.  Cars stopped to let
out  people  who desperately needed to puke.  Shiny and dirty exhaust pipes
coughed  smoke  that  smelled bad.  The smell found its way into Bill's gas
station  but no one cared.  The blood had stopped to stream out of his head
and  had  now  started to coagulate.  A fly landed on his face, looking for
food.  It walked around a bit before it crawled into Bill's mouth.
  The  third  customers  arrived at nine o'clock.  Two teenagers jumped out
from  a  chevrolet  and  danced their way into the station.  They were both
dressed  in white t-shirts and blue jeans together with hip  baseball caps.
When inside, they jumped into the air and did high-five with each other.
  "Yeah boy!  Lets get some beer before we hit the road again!" one of them
said.   The  other  one got down on his knees and yelled, with his hands in
the air:  "Beer!  Beer!"
  Laughing,  they  went  to  one  of  the shelves and took two six-packs of
Budweiser  each.   On their way to the counter one of the turned around and
walked back to the shelf.
  "Hey!   Where  are you going?" the other asked, still walking towards the
counter.
  "I think I want three six-packs boy!" he replied with a smile.
  The  teenager  placed the two six-packs under his arm and began to fumble
for another on the shelf.
  The  other one arrived to the counter, saw Bill behind it and immediately
dropped  the  beers.  One of the bottles exploded and sent white spume over
his legs.
  "Oh, fuck!" he screamed and took two steps backward in disgust.
  "What's wrong?" the other asked, clearly confused.
  The  teenager  with the spume over his legs looked at his friend, holding
his hand over the mouth.
  "Someone  has  been  shot  here..."  he  said  with  a  low voice, almost
whispering as if he was afraid that someone heard him.
  His  friend  shouted  "What?"  and  ran to the counter.  When he had seen
Bill's cold body he looked at his friend with a scared face.
  "What  the fuck are we going to do?" he asked.  "What the fucking fucking
hell are we going to fucking do?"
  "Have you got the shot gun with you...  in the trunk?"
  "Yes, of course..."
  "Fuck!   Let's  get  out of here!  If the police comes, we will be blamed
for this mess for sure!"
  They ran to the door at once.  But before they left, both of them took as
many  six-packs  as  they could carry.  The car roared away with a cloud of
dust behind it.
  If  Bill  had  been  alive,  he  would  have written down the letters and
numbers  on  the plate and reported them to the police for theft.  But Bill
had been dead for two  hours  and did not mind.  The two teenagers said the
same thing to each other while crying and getting drunk in the car on their
way to the beach.
  The  sun  climbed  the sky.  The day became hotter and hotter.  Fast cars
honked  angrily  at  those  who by some reason stayed within the ridiculous
speed  limit.   A  bus full of old people pulled over and stopped by Bill's
Shell station.  A group of pensioners stepped out, covering their eyes from
the sun.
  The clock turned eleven.
  The  driver,  a  tired  man,  stepped  out  and  lit  a  cigarette  while
waiting for the old people to finish their break.
  "Now  listen  to  me  love, a white-haired old woman said.  This is a gas
station  and it is forbidden, f-o-r-b-i-d-d-e-n, to smoke here!  Now put it
out at once!"
  The  man  dropped  the cigarette and stepped on it, mumbled something and
started  to  look  at  the  passing cars.  Seven old pensioners entered the
station.   Canes  clicked against the concrete floor, eyes closely examined
the price tags on several items.
  "Oh look!" a lanky man said.  "The cigars and potato chips are on sale!"
  The group slowly made their way to the shelf with the bargain.
  "You are right," someone said.  "Come on, lets buy this and then go."
  Wrinkled  hands reached for the items, placed the cigars and potato chips
in plastic bags before they in a slow pace went to the counter.
  They must have stared at Bill's corpse for several minutes before someone
broke the silence.
  "What a shame.  He looks so...  young."
  The others nodded.  An old woman looked through the window of the shop to
make sure that the driver did not know what was going on.
  "What  a  waste.  He could have done so much in his life.  Now it's all..
spoiled."
  "If we tell this to the driver," a bald man with a broken voice said, "we
will never get to our hotel!  Our vacation would be spoiled!"
  The others did not say anything.
  "This  is  not our problem!" the man continued.  "Why should we take care
of  this?   We  have  worked  our  whole  life,  earned  our living as good
citizens!  We deserve some fun!  We do not deserve this!"
  He  is  right,  they said to each other.  They walked outside and entered
the bus.  The driver praised the fact that he did not need to wait any more
before  the  bus  drove  away  on  the  freeway.  While cars ran on the hot
asphalt,  the pensioners ate their potato chips and whispered over and over
again  to  each other what a good idea it had been to leave without telling
the driver about the dead gas station keeper.
  Several  more  customers  entered the gas station that day.  Most of them
saw  poor Bill on his back behind the counter but no one did anything about
the situation.
  "This is not my problem!"
  "Why should I take care of this shit?"
  "Come on guys, lets split!"
  "I am not responsible!"
  "Let me just check if there is any money left before we leave!"
  When the night fell the road slowly chilled down and less cars drove past
Bill's  Shell  station.   Another day had passed and the hysterical freeway
would  calm  down for a few hours.  But this night, no one locked the doors
to the gas station and no one turned the neon signs off.
