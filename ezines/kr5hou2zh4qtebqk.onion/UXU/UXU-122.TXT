SUREDO [SWELL]

@SONG: Sonic Atmosphere

Sky, the sonic atmosphere
Longer light than year
Over the sun
Dancing in the air
Moving down the stair

Moon, talking to a cloud
Screaming far too loud
To the star
Living high above

He dreams away
Through clouds behind the moon

Fall, water's holy land
Since he understand
Into the deep, sinking down below

He dreams away
Through clouds behind the moon
His silent dream
To catch the starfilled [...]

Sky, sonic atmosphere
Longer light than year
Over the sun
Dancing in the air
Moving down the stair
To the moon
Talking to a cloud
Screaming far to loud
To the star
Living high above
Warm and dizzy love, but




@SONG: Levitate My Heart

Let me feel your hand
In the burning sand
Let me feel it now
Well, I know why

You turn, and turn away
On an ordinary day
Well I seek to find
My mind

I saw you turning round
[...] burning
Would you levitate my heart
And I notice someone
Always being wrong
Would you levitate my heart

So you turn, and turn away
On an ordinary day
You seek to find
Our mind

So you burn, and you burn again
Do the same refrain
And seek to find
Our minds

Well I saw you turning round
[...] burning
Would you levitate my heart
And I notice someone
Always being wrong
Would you levitate my heart

I saw you turning round
[...] burning
Would you levitate my heart
And I notice someone
That are always being wrong
Would you levitate my heart

Yes I notice someone
That are always being wrong
Would you levitate my heart
Just notice someone
Always wrong
Would you levitate my




@SONG: Harmonizer

Well, I will swim in water
Where everything is fine
I turn into the [...] my mind
But I never even tried girl
But I put my trust in you
Honestly I do

Well, I will swim in the ocean
Where everything I find
I put inside my head girl, inside my mind
But I never even tried to
Put my faith in you
And I never really do

I will swim in water
But I'm not sure if I'll ever find a shore
But you, you never told me
The right way to the shore

Well, I will swim in water
Where everything is fine
I put inside my head girl, inside my mind
But I never even tried girl
But I put my trust in you
Honestly I do
But I never even tried to
Put my faith in you
And I never really do

I will swim in water
But I'm not sure if I'll ever find a shore
But you, you never told me
The right way to the shore

I will swim in water
And I'm not sure if I'll ever find a shore
'Cause you, you never told me
The right way to the shore
To the shore
To the shore




@SONG: Inside Your Eyes

Inside your eyes
We swim, though we agree
Inside your mind
We ride as long we agree

Slightly pierced but torn off, dying
His mother smells the [...] lying

We went away to find a day
Inside a pink haze
I caught you say, the second day
That's stuck in your face

Inside your eyes
We swim, though we agree
Inside your mind
We ride as long we agree

Slightly pierced but torn off, dying
His mother smells the [...] lying

We went away to find a day
Inside a pink haze
I caught you say, the second day
That's stuck in your face

Slightly pierced but torn off, dying
His mother smells the [...] lying

We went away to find a day
Inside a pink haze
I caught you say, the second day
That's stuck in your face
We went away to find a day
Inside a pink haze
I caught you say, the second day
Is stuck in your face

PLEASUREHOUSE [MARSEILLE]

@SONG: Breathe

If you need to feel a love
Right give you a way
Give me a chance and I soothe your soul
Dreaming, trying, you regain control
Time is bright and so are we
I can saw so you can reap
Feelings to say [...] but it's cheap
Love or life, can't say
But it's easy to lose your way
[...] ever don't go stray
Let me die for you and I soothe your soul

So, let's feed our love
Breathe our love
So, let's be in love
Feed our love

I guess that I need to feel it now
Our eyes give us away
But give me a chance and I'll soothe our souls
Give me a try and we'll regain control
Time is bright and so are we
We can saw, we can reap
Feelings to say, and it's okay
Wrong or right, I can't say

So, let's feed our love
Breathe our love
So, let's be in love
Feed our love




@SONG: Summer

In this house surrounded by palm trees
I've lost the picture from my wallet
The picture's mudded and full of kisses
I tried to bite her, for a perfect passion

She's been on the [...] in a plastic suitcase
So I look around for the red-blue roses
Then I try to see her, in the taste of peaches
I know she's waiting for my summer letters

It's my perfect summer
My perfect summer

Out in the summer, I know I'm a seeker
Watch out the window, I'm sleeping and dreaming
Back of a postcard, I know she's been waiting
I know she's waiting for my summer roses

It's my perfect summer
My perfect summer

It is my perfect summer
My perfect summer [repeat 8]




@SONG: Blind

Who do you think that you are
Why do you think you gotta go far
You better stop dreaming
Perhaps turn around and round
Open your eyes try to realize
Things are not what they seem to be

You're so blind
You're so blind

[...] and [...] goes hand in hand
The truth is a [...]
Try to feel and understand
The world is not yours to command
You're so blind

Prepare yourself for what's ahead
Things are not what you think they are
So open your eyes and realize
That you're still sitting in the back row

Oh you're so blind
You're so blind
You're so, you're so blind
You're so, you're so blind
You're so blind
You're so blind




@SONG: Happy When You Leave

There is no reason why you should care
There is no reason why you should cry
Keep all the things that you want
You are the one who should leave

'Cause I'm happy to leave you
And my feelings are leaving

Take all your pain now through the door
I have no words enough for you
Don't talk to me anymore
Give back the keys when you leave

'Cause I'm happy to leave you
And my feelings are leaving
I'm happy to leave you
And my feelings are leaving

'Cause I'm happy to leave you
And my feelings are leaving
And I'm happy to leave you
And my feelings are leaving

I'm leaving you [repeat 4]




@SONG: Regrets

It was one of those days
It was like moving in an impossible maze

Then out of the misty haze
The sun struck [...] gleaming like lace
Shiny shiny shiny days
Shiny shiny shiny days

Couldn't find a possible maze
Things falls into place

Wonderful, wonderful Fay
You make me wanna burst out and sing
Shiny shiny shiny days
Moving faster kiss the skies
Shiny shiny shiny days
Moving faster in the skies

In my bed got an understanding
It is something called sharing
Try it and learn, try it and learn
And you will see how true love can burn

Shiny shiny shiny days
Moving faster kiss the skies
Shiny shiny shiny days
Moving faster in the skies
Shiny shiny shiny days
Shiny shiny shiny days




@SONG: This Is How It Feels

Through my window everything looks so, small
Thoughts go round, in my head, makes me wanna scream
Heaven is fading out, and so are we
Well, whatever, you were right I wish that I could cry

This is how it feels, to be lonely
This is how it feels, to be lonely

Steadying dark, steadying heart is so far away from me
Well missing me is what I want, where did everything go wrong
Song on the radio, makes me remember
First time I saw you, where did everything go wrong

This is how it feels, to be lonely
This is how it feels, to be lonely

Cold breeze, woke me up
I turned around, I wanted to reach you
Your eyes were full of tears, I couldn't move
I tried to speak, I really tried to listen
Then we made love with our eyes closed
Giving promises, eternal love
We're stuck in our dreams, we both know it
Is this how it feels to be in love

This is how it feels, to be lonely
This is how it feels, to be lonely
This is how it feels, to be lonely
This is how it feels, to be lonely

A SHRINE [LI & FRIENDS]

@SONG: Break

Feels like this, when I'm lying
Lego man, without eyes
Record shop, [...] street watch
Cheer him up anymore
I don't lie, my life

Feel depressed when I'm laughing
And my friend, my own head
Seems too small to contain me
Have my thoughts [...] and
Turn away from her sails

I'm telling you
I'm gonna break you down [repeat 4]
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you break you down

All messed up, and out of town yeah
I can't see another way
Always trying not to hurt her
I don't know, all the things I say
Don't make any sense

I'm telling you
I'm gonna break you down [repeat 4]
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you break you

And I don't know what I want
And I really don't care
'Cause I never met anyone, who knew
Just what they want

I'm gonna break you down [repeat 3]
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you down
Gonna break you break you down




@SONG: Lavatory Lama

'Cause of you
I laid in my bed staring at you
Watching when you [...] off
Well, yeah I'll try
To work things out
To turn around

But if you won't care
Then I won't care
And if you won't mind
Then I won't mind
I won't mind

You're bugging me
You're telling me it's time to go
To our own
Get a different point of view
Well, yeah I'll try
To work things out
To turn around

But if you won't care
Then I won't care
And if you won't mind
Then I won't mind
I won't mind

I never wanted more
I never tried for more
I just kept all I had and went along

But if you won't care
Then I won't care
And if you won't mind
Then I won't mind
And if you won't care
Then I won't care
And if you won't mind
Then I won't mind
I won't mind
I won't mind
I won't mind at all




@SONG: Motorcar

It has happened now
The thing that you swore that you'd never do
It has happened now
And it's him again
And pop, you are down on your back again

Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And everytime she comes around
She uses you for her own ends

It's your motorcar
She loves it when you drive her everywhere
But she won't pay no

Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And everytime she comes around
She uses you for her own ends
Her own ends

But it's never too far
Never too far
It's never too far
To go by car

It has happened now
The thing that you swore that you'd never do
It has happened now
And it's him again
And pop, you are down on your back again

Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And everytime she comes around
She uses you for her own ends
Her own ends
Everytime she comes around
She knocks you down and leaves you there
And every time she comes around
She uses you for her own ends
Her own ends

But it's never too far
Never too far
It's never too far
To go by car




@SONG: The Vibes

It's been in [...] of mind
Who wave at [...] 
How could I ever let it come
Ever let it come to this
Never hold onto a [...] 
Swimming on in life
Guess it's like I've been told
Everything goes round

How deep that I know
When the right wind to go
But I'm not so sure anymore
This is my religion
This is my belief
What I think I can forgive you
If I knew you really want to go

How can I let go [repeat 4]

You can turn me around
Until the day I go off
I won't have it come to that
No matter what they do to me
Every move is [...] 
Every move seem so [...] 
Finally come around the bend
Never certain about

How deep that I know
What's the right way to go
But I'm not so sure anymore
'Cause This is my religion
This is my belief
What I think I can forgive you
If I know you really want to go

How can I let go [repeat 12]




@SONG: The Drewling Baby

I cut myself today
I really don't know how
It wouldn't hurt that much
If I knew just how

I'm really calm this morning
But it still hurts a lot
Picked it in my mind
I never saw this other way

Little drewling baby
Is having a tooth
His hair is growing
His eyes will open
He will see the world
I know [repeat 3]

I never ever bleed
How ever much it hurts
Always drink too much
I cut myself again

We're trying to [...] 
We're trying to laugh
[...] makes me someone new
Smiling at me

Little drewling baby
Is having a tooth
His hair is growing
His eyes will open
He will see the world
I know [repeat 7]




@SONG: Wastebasket

Once to a friction, be often the wastebasket
A little while, according to the picture
But now this place's dead, I can't say that I'm sad, oh no
Guess I found a new way, to stay head over heels, all the time

Don't ask you to [...] 
As a drug can be
Without lying
Without lying

Every [...] so far, since I threw you away
[...] it's my old phone, don't want your help
'Cause new things never lie, and you lied to me, yeah you did
Fucking up myself, I know I always will

Don't ask you to [...] 
As a drug can be
Without lying
Without lying

Don't ask you to [...] 
As a drug can be
Without lying
Without lying

Don't ask you to [...] 
As a drug can be
Without lying
Without lying
