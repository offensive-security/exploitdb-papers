@SONG: Ten Little Girls

You think of no-one but yourself
You see the rest of us as fools
You think of no-one but yourself
You see the rest of us as fools

He said, don't feel guilty
Don't go crazy, don't get, paranoid with me

You play the prophet like a man
It makes no sense in the overall master plan

She said, don't feel guilty
Don't go crazy, don't get, paranoid with me

[--rap--]

You can't push your luck now
You can't push your luck now
Don't go crazy

Don't feel, feel, feel
Don't get, get, get

[--rap--]

Ten little girls come out to play
They don't stand a chance, and got blown away
Say it isn't so
Ten little boys come out to play
They don't stand a chance, and got blown away
Say it isn't so

Nine little girls got blown away
No, no, no, no
They didn't even have their own place to stay
Say it isn't so
Nine little boys got blown away
No, no, no, no
They didn't even have their own place to stay
Say it isn't so

@SONG: No Escape From Heaven
(THE Blindfold EP.)

I can see through your eyes, the back of your mind
All that's said is fiction, the blind leading the blind
I like to take your clothes off, and play for a while
Now hold my hand in summertime, walk for miles and you'll be a man
Hold my hand in summertime, and you are mine

It's no escape from heaven, try is in my eyes
It's no escape from heaven

I lie on the floor, don't open your eyes
Just listen to the sweetness of a slumber dive
Wake my heart of anger, let me in love
Push me into danger, give me a shove
Hold my hand in summertime, walk for miles and you'll be a man
Hold my hand in summertime, and you are mine

It's no escape from heaven, try is in my eyes
It's no escape from heaven

It's no escape from heaven, try is in my eyes
It's no escape from heaven

Hold my hand in summertime
Ohh just hold my hand in summertime

Hold me, hold me, hold me like you used to
Hold me, hold me, hold me like you used to
Hold me, like you used to
Hold me, like you used to

Hold my hand in summertime, walk for miles and you'll be a man
Hold my hand in summertime

Ohh Hold me, hold me, like you used to




@SONG: The Colour Hurts

In mongst the beginning
The final curtain descends
The doorway to dating
Has revealed, it smells tense

The colour hurts, in this last breath of sins
Why do you grow inside me
It smells of dew as if spirals to victory says
Why do you grow inside me
Leave me alone

I was doing okay before
But now you're here, hold my hand
Now you've won, I understand

The colour hurts, in this last breath of sins
Why do you grow inside me
It smells of dew as if spirals to victory says
Why do you grow inside me
Leave me alone
Ohh leave me alone

It's a [...] world for the complex is a [...] of sins

The colour hurts, in this last breath of sins
Why do you grow inside me
It smells of dew as if spirals to victory says
Why do you grow inside me

Sell me some rebirth [repeat 4]




@SONG: Coast Is Clear
(THE Frozen EP.)

Above my bed, in this ugly room
Hangs the whisper of the same man
You can't be my father, for the love we've shown
It's just a little to me, it's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be

Take it, I don't want it, you can have what you like
Just don't try to trick me to sleep, don't turn out the lights
You can't be my father, for the love we've shown
It's just a little to me, it's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and I always will be

Dreams of meeting truth, be my father
Dreams of meeting truth, for the [...]
Dreams of meeting truth, be my father
Dreams of meeting truth
Now I'm sick, always, always, always

Just when you thought it was all right [repeat 4]
Open your eyes now, girl

Coast is clear [repeat 10]

@SONG: Die Like a Dog
(THE Cherry EP.)

Could've, inable
I will take the fall
Could've, [...]
I will play ball

Hiding inner hope
I am secret oath
I get black and cold
I won't play ball

Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven

I'd like to say, to say that I'd survive
I'd like to [...], to say that I'd survive

Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone get heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven

Just try not to die like a dog
End up alone, freezing from the smog
I'm just trying not to die in vain
Then leave my mark, stake my claim

Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world, Peace in a world, Peace in a world
Free from religion

Listen to my eyes clean
In colorful confessions
I remember mutual aggression
Is all in the body's lips




@SONG: Horror Head
(THE Horror Head EP.)

Fireworks, blue and green
I can see what they sing
But you are away

You always smile

Boxing ring
The back of mules
You can really see, from the inside
Across the room

There's a horror in my head
When the blanket is gone
From the floor in my castle
Where I see the sun from

There's a horror in my head
When the blanket is gone
From the floor in my castle
Where I see the sun from

[-talk-]

In the comfort of this room
The challenge died
Remember you and me
We laughed 'til we cried




@SONG: Arms Out
(THE FaM-^Lt accompli EP.)

Oh I've seen that chapter in your eyes
It will tear us, apart
Something I don't understand
Has taken hold of you
Made you less than a man
Now here is open space
That was filled with you
That was filled with you
Silent tune is the only answer
To disconnect will be my shelter

Time, is running out on you
Time, won't be abused, abused, abused, abused

If only you knew
I'd be in love with you
If only you cared
I would throw my arms, and I would throw my arms out

You call me [...] on the phone
You have watched me [...]
With the secrets you have told
It's the end of us
It's the end of us

Pride, is getting in your way
It's only time, that can truly save
Can save, can save, can save

If only you knew
There would be nothing new
If you only come to care
I would throw my arms and I would throw my arms
And I would throw my arms and I would throw my arms

Arms out

Arms out

Time, is made out of you
With this, everything I do, I do, I do, I do

If only you knew
There would be nothing new
If you only come to care
I would throw my arms and I would throw my arms out

If only you knew
There would be nothing new
When you come to care
I would throw my arms and I would throw my arms
And I would throw my arms and I would throw my arms
And I would throw my arms and I would throw my arms out




@SONG: Split Into Fractions
(THE DoppelgM-^Dnger LP.)

Yeah 

Guilty much more from new
I can't confide all I want to
Spiteful with the fact of life
Not everyone you meet is that nice
When we scratch below the surface

The characters have merged, [...]
That split into fractions in front of your eyes

I'm so bitchin', love to be it
My friends and I just love to meet
We meet all the time 'cause we think we're clever
So surreal, it makes us feel better
We think we're so, clever

The characters have merged, [...]
That split into fractions in front of your eyes

In front of them
There is nothing to behold
In front of them
You can't be sure what you're dealing with
And that's got to be good for you

I'd die on the cross before I crossed you
You know I'd never hurt you
I'm just not that type of girl

Die on the cross before I cross you

Know I'd never hurt you

Just not that type
I'm just not that type of girl
