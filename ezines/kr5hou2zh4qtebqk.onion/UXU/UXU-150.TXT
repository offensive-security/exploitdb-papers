                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


               No R.I.P for Sedes mutha'fucking Diaboli yet!

                        This is just the beginning.


      "Access to computers and anything which may teach you something
         about how the world works should be unlimited and total."
                         (MONDO 2000: A User's Guide to the New Edge)



  Enough!   It  is  time  to stop the ignorant state from breaking down our
door,  stealing  our  equipment  and charging us for crimes wrapped in hard
packages  labeled  "hacking".  The police are educating themselves, step by
step,  how  the  computer  underground works.  It was once possible to hide
behind the curtain of knowledge, with the police standing on the other side
without  a  clue  how  to  deal with the electronic "crimes".  Now they are
catching  up  with  the  underground,  assisted  by  educated people in the
business.   People  who  once  were free idealists with a wish for the free
information have sold themselves to the state.  The easy hide and seek game
has  turned into  a war, a war where one side is shooting with high calibre
guns and the other side is desperately hiding themselves behind small boxes
of  remaining  knowledge.   The  underground is shaking in agony behind the
box, waiting for the last blow, almost unaware of the powerful gun it holds
in  its hand.  Rise from the shelter, aim, and fire back.  Hard and without
any signs of remorse.
  It is time to declare a full-scale war.
  Guns and night sticks may hurt, but they will never be as powerful as the
underground  can  be.   The rules of hacking, like to never crash a system,
are  fine  thoughts  and  would  work  nice if the game was played on equal
grounds.   But  why  should  the underground put up with fair play when the
state  plays rough?  If the members of a society are oppressed it will lead
to  terrorism and a revolution covered with blood.  The oppression is here,
where  is  the  revolution?  Continuing playing hide and seek will not work
forever.   Terror  must  strike.   The state must be painfully aware of who
they are trying to crush.
  The  state  have  succeeded in implanting fear into the underground.  The
underground is scared of the police, scared of hard night sticks, scared of
going  to  jail.   Grab the fear and throw it back.  Let the state fear the
hackers  for real.  Let them fear crashes, chaos and free information.  The
state will never buy threats like "if you touch me, I MIGHT...".  The state
needs  hard  proof  of  the  magnificent  power  that is boiling inside the
computer  underground.   Give  them  proof.   Throw  the fear back to them.
Paralyze  the  state,  push  them back to the time when they had no idea of
what to do.  When hackers first appeared, the state was confused.  They had
no  idea  how  to  handle  the  problem, and how hard they tried, it always
resulted  in  embarrassing  failure.   But  suddenly  they somehow found an
opening  to the problem, and the wedge was stuck into the underground.  The
state  and  pushing  and  pulling,  harder  and  harder,  to  open the hole
completely.   They  have  discovered  how  to  deal  with the problem - not
completely  however,  but  the  road is revealed.  They just have to follow
it...   To  keep  on blowing up bridges and putting up fake signs that says
"walk  this  way  instead"  will  soon  not do  you any good no more.  Turn
around,  enter  the  tanks,  recharge  your  guns and dig down thousands of
lethal mines.  When the state approaches and sees you, let them enjoy a few
seconds  of excitement,  before  the  mine field  detonates  and sends them
screaming  back  to hell.  The hell of panic and confusion.  The state will
scream  "Shit!   What  happened?   We  almost  got the little suckers!  Now
suddenly   everything  is  chaos!   Where  are  our  systems,  why  is  the
information  free,  why  do everybody mistrust us, and where THE FUCK is my
teddy bear?".
  Protect  yur  rights.   Do not allow the state to take it away from you.
This  is  not  a game any more.  Free information is not a toy that you are
trying to hold on to while chased by your big brother.  This is the reality
of our future as free people, this is war.  Fight the power, surf the edges
and  declare war.  Not tomorrow, not when your best friend has been busted,
not  when the police is breaking down your door.  Then it will be too late.
Use  your  knowledge  to  strike fear into the corrupted state.  It will do
everything  to  survive and keep you in a tight little box without windows.
The  state  will  not  play  for  fun  with  you, it hates you, and will do
everything to stop you from expanding your knowledge of the real world.
  The state will kill you - if you do not pull the electronic trigger first
and without fear.
