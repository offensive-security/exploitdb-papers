    Welcome to our 6th release.
    With this release, we break the 70-barrier, but hope we aren't
    releasing quantity. We try to release Quality as a rule, and that's
    the way we intend to keep it.


    We have added two new Contributors to our Writers Guild, and with
    them a couple of new specialities which you will soon find out by
    reading the new files in this release. We really thank these two
    new uXu-ians for joining us, and helping us continue to bring you
    more interesting and different files. We also hope to have these
    two as Members in the near future.


    A new section to the index files is the 'uXu Hall of Thanks' which
    contains official thanks to people out there who have helped us in
    one way or another. We can't possibly thank everyone, but those we
    we have forgotten, you know we thank you for your help.


    We haven't received any comments or views on the subject that we
    are copying cDc which we wanted, but we see that as evidence of
    our innocence in this case. We're NOT copying those neat cDc files.


    We still want comments on the Annual Awards we suggested in the
    release before this one, but so far, the only comment has been
    (and I quote): "What can u win???". 

    I can't believe that we're only reaching eLiTe-d00dz with our files
    (regarding the only comment we got, what else can we think?). I hope,
    sincerely, that there's still people out there who enjoy reading
    textfiles, and consider them an asset in the modem world. People like
    me and the members of uXu. If not, who reads our files?

         Read uXu file #58 for complete information about the Awards!

   [Note: Info Addict, the home BBS for uXu has changed name to The Stash]

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file and E-Mail
   The Chief for further information (if needed) or to let us know you'd
   like to join us. Don't hesitate! Call today!


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor may download files.

March  April  March  April  March  April  March  April Releases 1992:

063: "Divine Problems" by The GNN.   The Truth? You want the truth?
Well, I'm not sure you'll find it in here. What you Do find, is
a very amusing story, once again from The GNN, that lets you know
that anyone, and I mean ANYONE could have a 'bad day'. Read on..

064: "Castle Chronicles Chapter Four" by The Chief.   Hmm, is it
possible for Castle to continue his quest? Is it really something
to waste time on.. I mean finding this disappearing fella'. Who
benefits from it? The case is almost Klll-osed!

065: "Listen Carefully" by The GNN.   Technology. Is that something
little extra worth the trouble to get to the right results? Well,
who can say. This story takes you back, way back to the beginning,
but not in Time, no no, this journey takes place in Sound..

066: "The New Girl at Work" by Ralph 124C41+.   Life, Liberty,
and a healthy sex life. That's what we all need, right? Ralph
tells you about a fantastic experience here in his first file
for uXu, and it ain't about life or liberty.

067: "The Doors' Complete Lyrics" by Quiksilver.   The complete
works. Yes, it is true. Quiksilver gives you a chance to capture
the amazing feeling of The Doors with their lyrics in one packed
file. The first file from Quiksilver for uXu, and it sure is
worth the download for the fan.

068: "What Happened?" by The GNN.   Can you answer that question?
Well, you sure can't before you've read the file, can you? No.
But I'm not sure you can, even after you've read it. This is the
'GNN file of the month'. Please check it out.

069: "The European Digest Vol.2 Issue #01" by The Chief.   It's
back. Right on track with the next chapter in the XENIX Tutorial
which you all have been waiting for. Am I right or am I RRRight!?
As our distinguished readers already know, TED includes a lot of
other stuff as well. Comments, the Recommended section, Notes
from the author and so on. A file for the wise.

070: "A Joke for VMS-Users" by Ralph 124C41+.   Heheh, yes, why
not have some fun with the other users on your VMS system? It
sure is fun to make them completely confused, and you're the
only one with the answer to their problems. If you're a VMS kinda
fella', you want this one.

071: "Judgement Day" by The GNN.   Something is happening to the
universe as we know it. We've all heard about Armageddon, Judgement
Day, and we've seen Terminator II, but that's just peanuts compared
to this astonishing little story, from our fiction-meister, The GNN.

072: "uXu Index #6" by The Chief.   Oh my God! It's the 6th Index!
We're going for gold here, continuing to release a bunch of textfiles
for our yet-to-answer-us-on-our-questions public out there. Get it?
If you've read one of our previous index files, you already know that
the Index contains;

          * An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          * Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          * An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List
          * An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          * All the new release files in Long format.
          * An updated list of boards where to contact uXu.

             [#72 also includes an Index for the uXu-S series]
