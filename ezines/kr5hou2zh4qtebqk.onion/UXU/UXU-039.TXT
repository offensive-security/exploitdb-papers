                             DEPTH CHARGE
                           by THE GNN/DC/uXu


  This is a very old idea, but old ideas can be fun too, can't they?
I got the idea from someone who called himself Dolata on UseNet's
alt.pyrotechnics a long time ago. All credits to him.

  What you need for a small depth charge:

  A Plastic Bottle 
  Vinegar
  Baking Soda
  A Few Small Rocks

  Put some rocks into the bottle, enough for it to sink in water. But
not too many since you need some space. Fill 2/3 of the bottle with
vinegar. (Oh, yes *this* old trick). Then wrap a spoon of baking soda
into a piece of paper and tie a little string to it.

  Now carefully hang the paper with the baking soda over the vinegar
in the bottle and screw on the cap. The thing should look like this:

       ----
       :; :
      / ;  \
     /  ;   \             So I guess you know what to do now? 
    |  +BS+ |             Next time your girlfriend takes a bath,
    |       |             unscrew the cap and the baking soda will
    |XXXXXXX|             fall into the vinegar and start reacting.
    |vinegar|             Quickly screw the cap on again and throw
    |XXXXXXX|             it into the bath. It will sink to the bottom
    |(rocks)|             and...bom... If you hate her use a glass
    |OOOOOOO|             bottle instead.
