 1. INTRODUCTION
 ---------------
 Welcome to TED Vol.1 Issue #1 - The uXu File #1!

 The European Digest Series have come to life because of the massive amount
 of claimed underground bulletin board systems that, in recent years, have 
 seen the light, or, on the other side, have hit the dust. The European
 Digest Vol.1 Issue #6 and #7 will include lists of Established and Known
 Underground Boards, in area-code order, and with comments, facts, status
 (number of members, meetings and so on), and a record of the amount of
 Online Gfiles available.

 This series will not, repeat NOT, be updated in a regular basis because of
 the pre-mentioned massive amount of boards that exist today. It is impossible
 to update it regularly without having that as a full-time job. And, secondly,
 I call Long Distance to ALL of these boards, which keeps the phone-bill at a
 regular $1000.00 amount.

 2. THEN WHY?
 ------------
 Well, I have, probably as the most of you reading this, called a few boards
 in my lifetime. More than often, these boards have claimed to be Under-
 ground boards with:

 'More than XXXX+ Gfiles Online'
 'Very Active Subs'
 'Serious discussions'
 'H/P/A/V/C/x Only! No ELITE!'
 'Latest Hacker Utils'
 'Full Access First Call'
 'Free Leeching'.

 I can say straight away that 90-95% of these "Claims" have been false, and
 have been encountered when checked with:

 'The HD just crashed last week...'
 'I had to make room for another Warez Filearea...'
 'I don't know you, so I can't give you Full Access on the first call...'
 'Is Hacker v0.0087 Beta NOT the latest version?...'

 and stuff like the following:

 * On A 'Free Leeching' Board:
   ---------------------------
   YOUR UL/DL RATIO IS .....
   YOU MUST UPLOAD xxxx GB Before Downloading
   GFILE AREA NOT AVAILABLE
   FILE AREAS NOT AVAILABLE
   NOTHING IS AVAILABLE
   NO LEECHING! - LEECH AND YOU'RE KICKED OUT!
   NO CARRIER

 * On A 'H/P/A/V/C/x! No Elite!' Board:
   ------------------------------------
   AREA 27   AMIGA 0-DAY WAREZ ONLY
   AREA 87   IBM 0-WEEK WAREZ ONLY
   (E) ELITE ONLY! MESSAGES SUBS
   PARABLOCKS HQ 9600- ONLY!
   BLAH BLAH BLAH...SOFTWARE... BLAH...IF YOU AGREE TYPE 'OK' ONLY
   IF YOU ARE A 'LAMER' YOU'RE KICKED OUT! ONLY 0-DAY WAREZ!
   NO CARRIER ONLY

 * On A 'Very Active Subs' and 'Serious Discussions' Board:
   --------------------------------------------------------

   Title: Help!
   ............
   I have a Vic-20 and I have problems.
   When I call with my 1200/75 modem I
   can't connect to any bulletin board
   systems except for this one. Please
   help. Also, I wonder what Basic is?

   Bye!!
   ps. What is 80 columns? ds.

  ...and so it goes. On and On, and even After you have checked the board,
  received the 'explanations' from the SysOp, the Ads still look the same.
  You start to understand the point to this series? Well, here's something
  even Worse (if possible)!
 
 3. EVEN WORSE!
 --------------
 We have all read about Feds and SS who starts Fake Underground Boards. Now
 how can you see the difference from a real one? How can you decide NOT to
 call 'Dragons Dentist' when you don't know that it is a Fed Bust-Board?
 Here's a little piece from a very funny (and true) gfile called 'Feds,
 how to find and eliminate them' (author unknown):

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Feds can be found in almost every major bbs system in the country. They are
 the ones who keep asking the "famous name" pirates for warez, and post none of
 their own. Yes, the fed is the ultimate leech. They are also mistaken for 12-
 14 year-old leeches, but sysops can usually tell that something is wrong when
 a 13-year-old who "just started last week" is typing faster than the fire rate
 for an UZI sub-machine gun.... and uses words like "extenuating", "viable",
 and "situation normal". The typical 13-year-old follows the real leech's
 guide, with "k00l", "<``l", "rad", "l8t0r", and "do you have this...?".

 WHERE THEY HANG OUT: Sprint, MCI, Telediscount, AT&T, ESS, and Metro (?)
 Security offices.... Police Stations... Large BBS's... Gay Bars... You know...
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 That's some good advice there. We have also seen articles like:
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 COLORADO COPS GO ONLINE 

 The board, which uses RBBS software, is open after 5 pm weekdays and
 all day Saturdays and Sundays at 303-987-7388. The department's address is 445
 S. Allison Parkway, Lakewood, CO 80226.  
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FORBIDDEN ZONE BBS BUSTED

 The FBI set up their own BBS to nail the kid (the SysOp).
 - How was the FBI able to use a BBS to catch the Forbidden zone?
 I understand that it was used to track uploaders of commercial software.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 POLICE SET UP BULLETIN BOARD STINGS

 For more than two years, the department secretly ran a board called the
 Underground Tunnel, which was set up to appear as a bulletin board run by a
 system operator called Pluto.  But late last month - to the surprise of the
 board's more than 1,000 users - Pluto was revealed as Sgt. Robert Ansley, a
 seven-year veteran of the police department.

 Sting and intelligence gathering bulletin board operations are on the rise
 throughout the country, according to law enforcement officials. Several police
 departments nationwide have already used bulletin boards to track down and
 arrest microcomputer users who post illegally obtained calling card codes,
 mainframe access procedures and passwords, or other confidential information.
 According to one high-lvel West Coast law enforcement officer who declined to
 be identified, federal officials are now joining local authorities in running
 bulletin boards in several key metropolitan areas.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (all article-excerpts courtesy of the writers & authors)

 This is a bit scary, because when there are Cop-SysOps around, the information
 flow will thin out to NOTHING in the end. No new underground boards will be
 accepted, and when the old ones die, there will be Zero Underground boards
 to call! For an example, Ripco was a Great board once. Had the reputation, was
 known to a majority of underground users, and had been active for a very long
 time. After it got up again, after the bust, people was of course reluctant
 to call. Most explanations were 'Feds got it once..' and 'Ever heard of
 bugs?'. I understand these people, and therefore it would be nice to TRUST the
 boards we call by checking them out. Now, you all say 'So how are You going to
 spot the difference between a Fake BBS and a Genuine Underground Board then??'
 Answer: I can't! That's a problem. All I wanted to say by this is that you
 can Never trust New Unknown Underground Boards and that you should be careful
 when calling one. Of course I will report Fake Boards if I spot any, so keep
 an eye on the "Number of Feds" grade in the BBS-Listings, starting in TED
 Issue #6.


 4. SysOp's Underground Network (SUn)
 ------------------------------------
 The SySop's Underground Network is a group of SySops who, in the effort to 
 further advance the state of underground computing, have joined together 
 to form a network.  It will not include 'warez type boards', so if that's
 your thing, you can't be a member.  They will concentrate instead on the 
 informational boards.  Text files, P/H/A/C/V bases, and good 'underground' 
 activities. 

 A Recent forming of an information-spreading Network have made the job of 
 spotting Feds and fake boards easier. SysOp's Underground Network will keep
 it's members updated on Fake Users and Feds spotted on Underground boards,
 and Busts. The members in their turn will inform the members of their boards,
 and they will then warn their friends. This will mean that fake users and feds
 will have a hard time keeping their identity secret, and will hopefully not be
 able to harm the underground community too much.
 
 To join The SysOp's Underground Network, you have to be an Underground Board
 SysOp (if you didn't understand that by now), and you have to fill out the
 SUn Application form and agree to the rules therein. The SUn application form
 can be obtained on the following boards:

                    Persistance Of Time.....313-462-1141
                    Guild Of Assains........713-933-7248
                    Project X...............713-356-2042
                    DoPey's Domain..........714-951-7939
                    Info Addict.............+46-###-####
                    The Lifetime Detour.....313-644-5505
                    The Crowbar Hotel.......409-372-5511

 5. NOW YOU KNOW
 ---------------
 These things should be more than enough to convince you that this series of
 files will be needed. If someone have the time to keep the BBS-Check files
 updated, that help would be greatly appreciated. It sure would be useful.
 
 If you still aren't convinced, please go into your bathroom, fill the bath-
 tub with ice-cold water, (add a few 100's of ice-cubes), and get into it.
 Thank you.
 
 6. OOPS!
 --------
 This file should have been the 1st BBS Check file, but became a my view
 of the underground bulletin board scene. I am tired of wasting my time on
 those fake/empty/claim-to-be-great boards. That's the way gfiles are born.....

 8. END COMMENTS
 ---------------
 You have probably already guessed that I am not American (my spelling stinks!)
 Well, I am working on my spelling so hang in there guys. It will get better.
 
 The European Digest will not feature Hacking techniques, Phreaking, Carding,
 information about government systems or the basic underground rap. It will 
 be different. It IS different. Manuals, The Underground Scene, Deep Deep
 whatever, and so on. Less 'general rag stuff' and More Miscellaneous stuff.
 Swedish Hacker News will be presented through the 'uXu - Swedish News' series,
 but ONLY in Swedish. English translations will however be published in other
 well-known underground rags, as contributions.
