                      THE CIVILIZED PRIMITIVE PROWLER
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu

                             "Everything goes!"
                                  (P.K Feyerabend)


  Carefully,  he tried to sneak past the door.  But he failed as usual.  As
if the boss had waited for him, the door opened violently.
  - You are late!  the boss shouted at him.
  - Sorry, he said and walked on.
  - Next time, you will be even MORE sorry!
  When  he  had  entered his office and convinced himself that the boss was
far away, he took a deep breath of relief.

          did you say something?  He asked softly.
          yeah, i said that you were fucking late!
          oh  really,  and  if I enjoy being late then? what are YOU
        going to do about it?  fire me?  fuck me?
          the  boss  did  not say anything.  He just stared. stared,
        like  a  pig  in  the mud.  stare stare stare.  that was his
        real job.  to scream and then just STARE.
          you  know that I hate you, don't you?  He said with a calm
        voice.
          now  He  was  in a rage.  but on the outside, He was soft.
        the boss reacted.  the boss raised his fist.  get out!  now!
        the boss' face  was  red  and  hot. any second,  steam would
        probably make it's way out of his clean white shirt.
          out?  He said.  listen to facts!
          He  bent  down,   placed  his  briefcase  on the floor and
        opened it.  instead of a pile of papers, there was a kitchen
        knife  there.   He reached for it and got to his feet again.
        the boss just stared.  stare stare stare.  He held the knife
        in front of the eyes of his boss.  the boss opened his mouth
        as  if  He  was  going to  say something. the boss never got
        the chance. with a fast  move,  He let the knife open up the
        throat  of  his  boss.   the mouth was still open when blood
        gushed all over the white shirt. with a smile He watched his
        boss  trying  to  stop  the  flood with his hands.  the boss
        choked.   the  boss  STARED  at him. stare!  stare! quickly,
        He pushed the boss  back  into  the  office.  then He closed
        the door and left.


  He  left  the  sidewalk  and  stepped  to  the  cross-road.  A car honked
aggressively  at him. He pretended that he did not hear it and quickly made
his way to the other side.
        
          He  stopped.  the car honked again.  the anger exploded in
        his  head  and  sent shock-waves to his entire body.  I have
        got  the right to walk here and no car can stop me.  the car
        honked again.  He turned to it and stared at the driver.  it
        was  a  woman.   secure  in  her car.  no one can touch her.
        secure.
          fuck  you,  He screamed and pointed at her.  people around
        him stopped and watched.  fuck you, He screamed again.
          she  began  to  look scared.  she did not know what to do.
        he  took  a  step  against  the  car, the castle of iron and
        steel.
         her  fear  turned  into  irritation.  she lifted her
        arm,  hesitated for a second, but slammed the steering-wheel
        again.   the sound of the car honking for the third time had
        a message.
          He  jumped onto the hood.  the car rocked from his weight.
        she  looked  confused.   the  gun was suddenly there, in his
        hand.   the  next  second, a shot was heard.  the windscreen
        shattered.  another shot was heard.


  Almost  all  of the ten toilets were busy.  Just one were free.  But just
as  he  were  going  to touch the handle and open the door, someone roughly
made his way past him and sneaked inside.
  Shit, he thought. Why do I always have to wait?

          the door opened and the tall man tried to enter the toilet
        before He did.
        no  way! I was here first!  He placed his leg in the way and
        the man tripped.  a  messy  sound  was  heard  when  the man
        crushed his skull against the cold concrete floor.
          you have been punished, He thought.  but not enough!
          He felt good when He pissed on the dead body.


  It  was  in the middle of the night when the phone rang.  The sound shook
his  head  and  dragged  him  right of dream land.  It did not feel good to
leave the warm bed just to answer the phone.
  - Yeah?
  - Sorry, I called the wrong number.
  - Ok.
  He  hung  up  and crawled back to bed.  It took ten seconds, and then the
phone rang again.
  - Yeah?
  - You again?  I am really sorry, I must have been given the wrong number.
  - Ok.
  He hung up.  The phone did not ring any more that night. But he could not
sleep.

          He hung up.  then He rushed down the stairs and out on the
        streets.   He  searched  every  house  in the entire country
        before  He  found  the bastard.  He was sitting by the phone
        and  called  up  sleeping people just to say that He got the
        wrong  number.   the  bastard  looked  quite  scared when he
        dashed into his room.
          now I got you, you fucking shithead!  He screamed.
          the bastard was fat and ugly.  the bastard tried to defend
        himself  with the handset but with no results.  He kicked it
        away  and the entire phone fell to the floor and exploded in
        a cloud of smoke.  the bastard was unarmed.
          I  am  so lonely, the bastard said.  I have to call people
        to hear a voice.  understand me.
          get a life, He said.
          He  gave  the  bastard  a  hard  punch over the chin.  the
        bastard was knocked unconscious.  He dragged the fat body to
        the  bed that was placed in a corner of the small room   and
        tied the bastard to it.
          then  He  went  back  out  on  the streets again.  when he
        returned,  the  bastard  had  woken  up.   He  held  the big
        phone-booth that He had stolen over his head and screamed
          wrong number!
          wrong number!
          then  He  threw  the phone-booth against the bastard.  the
        bastard  yelled  in panic.  the phone-booth landed on top of
        the  bastard  and  crushed  every  bone  in the body.  blood
        dripped from the bed and down on the floor.
          He left the room, satisfied.


  In  the corner of his eye, he noticed how his little bother quickly moved
the queen over the chess board.
  Oh  dear,  he  thought.  My  brother  -  nine years old - plays chess and
cheats.  Why cannot kids of today learn what honesty means?
  He  planned  to  tell  his  brother  a few chosen words about how much he
dislike people who cheats.
  But he did not.  There was probably no idea anyway.

          what  the  fuck  did  you  do?  He  asked  and  pushed the
        chess table away.  it crashed down on the floor.
          I  asked  you  a question, you asshole!  he screamed, this
        time very loud.
          his brother looked shocked.
          suddenly,  He  decided  to wipe out the face of his little
        brother  forever.   with a hard stroke, a iron stick smashed
        the  head  of  his brother to nothing.  the brain of smeared
        itself all over the wall paper.
          He threw the iron stick out of a window, then He turned to
        the brain on the wall paper and said
          you cannot use that one to cheat any more!

  TG>>  I would like a few comments about my latest files.

LO>    Well,  I  must  say  that they were...  rather average.  I felt that
LO>  they had no real SUBSTANCE, if you get my point of view.  Sometimes, I
LO>  feel that  you only write  for the "sake of writing".   Try to include
LO>  more "facts" in them, like I do.
LO>    Talking about files, I have a LOT OF IDEAS right now!  I will try to
LO>  get  some  free time (from all my girls!) and write them down, so stay
LO>  tuned!

I see. Thanks for your critic.

          fuck you
          fuck you
          fuck you
          I  shit  on your crappy files, and I know that you hate me
        as much as I hate you and your pseudo-intellectual bullshit!
        I  want to kill you and erase your account from this planet!
        die slow and in pain.
          you  believe that you are something in this world, but you
        are  nothing  -  only  a  big  mouth  that  produces selfish
        statements that results in anger anger anger around you.
        some day we will meet -  you and me alone.
          until then...
