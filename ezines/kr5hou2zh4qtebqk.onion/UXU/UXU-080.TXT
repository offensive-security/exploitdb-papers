 1. INTRODUCTION
 ---------------
 Welcome to TED Vol.2 Issue #3 - The uXu File #80!
 This is Chapter 4 of the XENIX Tutorial series, Part 2, which concludes
 chapter 4, and we're only two chapters from covering the complete manual.
 Alongside with this series, we're covering Digital's VMS version 5, but
 we will NOT publish the complete manual-package, only those sections we
 get requests about, so if you don't request it, we will not publish it,
 and you can take that to the bank. Enjoy.

4.4.2                          USING LP OPTIONS                           4.4.2
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <lp> command has several options that help you control the printed
output. You can specify the number of copies you want printed by using the
number option, <-n>. For example, to print two copies of [printfile], enter:

                            <lp printfile -n2>

   Several different printers are often attached to a single XENIX system.
With the <-d> option, you can specify the printer on which your file is to
be printed. To print two copies of [printfile] on a printer named [laser],
enter:

                         <lp printfile -n2 -dlaser>

   Check with your system administrator for the names of the printers
available on your system.


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.4.3                       CANCELLING A PRINT REQUEST                    4.4.3
_______________________________________________________________________________

   Use the <cancel> command to cancel a print request. The <cancel> command
takes as its argument the request ID. For example, to stop printing a file
with a request ID of [laser-245], you would enter:

                            <cancel laser-245>

   Experiment with <cancel> by using <lp> to print [printfile] and then
using <cancel> to cancel the print request. When you are finished, enter the
following command to remove [printfile]:

                               <rm printfile>

   You can also use the <cancel> command to stop whatever is currently
printing on a particular printer. For example, to cancel whatever file is
currently printing on the printer [laser], you would enter the following
command:

                               <cancel laser>

   If you cancel a file that does not belong to you, mail reporting that the
print request was canceled is automatically sent to the file's owner.


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.4.4             FINDING OUT THE STATUS OF A PRINT REQUEST               4.4.4
_______________________________________________________________________________

   Use the <lpstat> command to check on the status of your print request.
To use it, simply enter the following:

                                    <lpstat>

   The <lpstat> command produces output like the following:

                  --------------------------------------------
                  prt1-121      cindym     450   Dec 15  09:30
                  laser-450     cindym    4968   Dec 15  09:46
                  --------------------------------------------

   Note that entering <lpstat> with no options displays information on your
files only, not those of other users. To generate a report for all users on
your computer, use <lpstat> with the <-o> option. Nothing is displayed by the
<lpstat> command if the print job is complete.

   The first column of the <lpstat> output shows the request ID for each of
your files being printed. The second column is your login name. In the third
column, the number of characters to be printed is shown, and the fourth
column lists the dates and times the print requests were made.

   To learn the status of a particular file, use the <lpstat> command with the
file's request ID. For example, to find out the status of a file with the
request ID of [laser-256], you would enter the follwing command:

                               <lpstat laser-256>

   The status of that file only is displayed.

   You can also request the status of various printers on your system by
using the <-p> option or by giving the name of the particular printer you
are interested in. Enter the following command to find out the status of all
the printers on your system:

                                  <lpstat -p>

   To find out the status of a printer named [laser], you would enter the
following:

                                <lpstat -plaser>

   The request ID and status information for each file currently waiting
to be printed on [laser] is displayed.

4.5                            WORKING WITH FILES                           4.5
_______________________________________________________________________________

   File manipulation (creating, deleting, displaying, combining, renaming,
moving, and copying) is one of the most important capabilities an operating
system provides. The XENIX commands that perform these functions are described
in the following sections.


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.1                       DISPLAYING FILE CONTENTS                      4.5.1
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <more> command displays the contents of a file, one screenful at a
time. It cannot be used to edit files. If the file contains more than one
screenful of data, you see the following prompt after each screen of text
is displayed:

                                --More--(XX%)

   XX% represents the percentage of the file displayed. Press the RETURN
key to display another line. Press the SPACEBAR to display another screen.

   Try the follwing command:

                               <more /etc/rc>

   This causes the contents of [/etc/rc] to display on the screen. To quit
<more> before [/etc/rc] is finished displaying, press [q] for quit.

   The <more> command does not allow you to scroll backward, towards the
beginning of the file. However, you can search forward for patterns with
<more> by using the slash (/) command. For example, enter the following
commands to search for a line containing "process" in [/etc/rc]:

                                <more /etc/rc>
                                </process>

   You see the following message at the top of the screen:

                      --------------------------------
                      ...skipping
                      --------------------------------

   If the pattern is found, it is displayed two lines below this message.
If the pattern is not found, "Pattern not found" is displayed.

   If you are looking at a file with <more> and decide that you want to
edit the file, you can invoke the <vi> editor by pressing [v]. Of course,
you must have write permission on a file before you can edit it with <vi>
or any other text editor. To display the file's contents, you only need
read permission.

   You will often use <more> in pipes. For example, <more> is useful when
you want to list the contents of a directory in long format. Enter the
following command to display a long listing of the contents of [/bin], one
screenful at a time:

                             <l /bin | more>

   (For more information on pipes, refer to Chapter 2 of this tutorial)

   The <head> and <tail> commands, display the beginning and the end of
a file, respectively. With no options, they display the first or last 10
lines. Enter the following command to display the last 10 lines of [/etc/rc]:

                              <tail /etc/rc>

   You can specify exactly how many lines you want displayed. Enter the
following command to display the first 20 lines of [/etc/rc]:

                             <head -20 /etc/rc>

   Enter the following command to display the last 20 lines of [/etc/rc]:

                             <tail -20 /etc/rc>

   The <cat> command also displays the contents of a file. Unlike <more>,
<cat> continuously scrolls the file until you stop the scroll with CTRL-S.
CTRL-Q continues scrolling. Scrolling stops automatically when the end of
the file is reached. To stop scrolling before the end of the file, press
INTERRUPT, which is the DEL key on most keyboards.

   Enter the following command to display the contents of [/etc/termcap].
Use CTRL-S and CTRL-Q to stop and start the scrolling and INTERRUPT to halt
the scrolling before the end of the file is reached:

                              <cat /etc/termcap>

_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.2                           DELETING FILES                            4.5.2
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <rm> command is used to delete files. We have used it throughout this
chapter to delete various files. Use <cd> to change to your home directory
and enter the following command to create three new files:

                   <touch tempfile1 tempfile2 tempfile3>

   Delete [tempfile3] by entering the following command:

                                 <rm tempfile3>

   The <-i> option allows you to remove files interactively by asking you
if you really want to delete each of the files specified on the command
line. If you press [y] followed by a RETURN, the given file is removed.
If you press [n], the file is left untouched. This option is useful when
removing files from a directory that contains many files. It helps you
avoid erasing files accidentally that you really want to keep.

   Experiment with the <-i> option by entering the following command:

                         <rm -i tempfile1 tempfile2>

   Note that you can place several filenames on the <rm> command line. This
is true for most XENIX commands. You can also use wildcard characters. For
example, instead of entering the above command, you could enter the
following:

                             <rm -i tempfile*>

   (The use of wildcard characters on the XENIX command line is discussed
in Chapter 2 of this tutorial.)


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.3                           COMBINING FILES                           4.5.3
_______________________________________________________________________________

   In addition to displaying files, the <cat> command can be used to combine
several existing files into a single new file. This is done by redirecting
the output of <cat> into a new file. The greater-than sign (>) is used for
redirection. If the new file does not exist, it is created automatically.
(If you are not familiar with redirection, see Chapter 2 of this tutorial.)

   Use <cd> to move to your home directory and enter the following command
to combine [/etc/motd] and [/etc/rc] into a file named [catfile]:

                     <cat /etc/motd /etc/rc > catfile>

   Now display the contents of the new file [catfile] with the <more>
command:

                              <more catfile>

   The symbol >> can be used with <cat> to append one file to the end of
another file. For example, to append the contents of [/etc/motd] to [catfile],
enter the following command:

                         <cat /etc/motd >> catfile>

   The contents of [/etc/motd] should now be placed at the beginning and
at the end of [catfile]. Verify this with the following <head> and <tail>
commands:

                             <head -20 catfile>
                             <tail -20 catfile>


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.4                           RENAMING FILES                            4.5.4
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <mv> command is used to move files around the XENIX filesystem and
also to rename files. Use <cd> to move to your home directory. Rename
[catfile], created in section 4.5.3, to [catfile2], by entering the following
command:

                              <mv catfile catfile2>

   After this move is completed, [catfile] no longer exists. The file
[catfile2] exists in its place. Verify this by entering the following
command:

                                     <lc>


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.5                            MOVING FILES                             4.5.5
_______________________________________________________________________________

   To move a file into another directory, give the name of the destination
directory as the final name on the <mv> command. You do not need to specify
the destination filename. For example, enter the following command to move
[catfile2], created in section 4.5.4, to the [/tmp] directory:

                           <mv $HOME/catfile2 /tmp>

   To be sure that [catfile2] is in [/tmp] and not in the current directory,
enter the following command:

                                  <lc . /tmp>

   (Remember that you can enter more than one argument on most XENIX
command lines, and that the dot (.) stands for the current directory.)

   Finally, move [catfile2] back to the current directory by entering the
following command:

                             <mv /tmp/catfile2 .>

   The <mv> command always checks to see if the last argument is the name
of a directory. If it is, all files designated by filename arguments are
moved into that directory. However, if you do not have write permission on
the directory to which you are attempting to move files, the move fails.


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.6                            COPYING FILES                            4.5.6
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <cp> command is used to copy files. There are two forms of the <cp>
command, one in which files are copied into a directory and another in which
a file is copied to another file.

   Use <cd> to change to your home directory. Then enter the following command
to copy the contents of [catfile2], created in section 4.5.4, to [catfile3]:

                            <cp catfile2 catfile3>

   You now have two files with identical contents. To copy [catfile2] and
[catfile3] to the [/tmp] directory, enter the following command:

                           <cp catfile2 catfile3 /tmp>

   This last command can be simplified by using a wildcard character:

                              <cp catfile* /tmp>

   Like the <mv> command, <cp> always checks to see if the last argument
is the name of a directory, and, if so, all files designated by filename
arguments are copied into that directory. However, unlike the <mv> command,
<cp> leaves the original file untouched. There should now be two copies of
[catfile2] and [catfile3] on the system, one copy of each in the current
directory and one copy of each in [/tmp].


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.5.7                            FINDING FILES                            4.5.7
_______________________________________________________________________________

   A XENIX filesystem can contain thousands of files. Because of this,
files can often get lost. The <find> command is used to search the file-
system for files. The command has the form:

                    <find pathname -name filename -print>

   The pathname is the pathname of the directory that you want to search.
The search is recursive; it starts at the directory named and searches
downward through all files and subdirectories under the named directory.

   The <-name> option indicates that you are searching for files that have
a specific filename. The <-print> option indicates that you want to print
that pathnames of all the files that match [filename] on your screen.

   Enter the following command to search all directories and subdirectories
for [catfile2], the file created in section 4.5.4:

                      <find / -name catfile2 -print>

   It may take a few minutes for this command to finish executing. The
output of this <find> command should indicate that there are at least two
occurrences of [catfile2], one in [/tmp] and one in your home directory.
Remove [catfile2] and [catfile3] from [/tmp] and from your home directory
by entering the following command:

                     <rm /tmp/catfile* $HOME/catfile*>


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.6                            PROCESSING TEXT FILES                        4.6
_______________________________________________________________________________

   XENIX includes a set of utilities that let you process information in
text files. These utilities enable you to compare the contents of two files,
sort files, search for patterns in files, and count the characters, words,
and lines in files. These utilities are described below.


_______________________________________________________________________________

4.6.1                           COMPARING FILES                           4.6.1
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <diff> command allows you to compare the contents of two files and
to print out those lines that differ between the files. To experiment with
<diff>, use <vi> to create two files to compare. The files will me [men] and
[women]. First <cd> to your home directory. Then enter the following command
at the XENIX prompt:

                                   <vi men>

   When you are placed in <vi>, press the [i] key to enter Insert Mode, 
and then type the following lines:

                      Now is the time for all good men to
                      Come to the aid of their party.

   Press ESC to return to Command mode and save [men] by entering [:w].
   While still in Command mode, enter the following command to create
   [women]:

                                 <:n women>

   You see the following message:

                      ---------------------------------
                      "women" No such file or directory
                      ---------------------------------

   You are then placed in [women]. Press [i] to enter Insert mode and then
enter the following lines:

                     Now is the time for all good women to
                     Come to the aid of their party.

   Press ESC to return to Command mode, then [:x] to save [women] and
leave <vi>. You have now created [men] and [women].

   Enter the following command to compare the the contents of these two
files:

                             <diff men women>

   This <diff> command should produce the following output:

4.6.2                            SORTING FILES                            4.6.2
_______________________________________________________________________________

   One of the most useful file processing commands is <sort>. When used
without options, <sort> alphabetizes lines in a file, starting with the
leftmost character of each line. These sorted lines are then output to
the screen, or to a file if redirection is used on the <sort> command
line. This command does not affect the contents of the actual file.

   Enter the following command to display an alphabetized list of all
users who have system accounts:

                             <sort /etc/passwd>

   The <sort> command is useful in pipes. Enter the following command to
display an alphabetized list of users who are currently using the system:

                                <who | sort>

4.6.3                 SEARCHING FOR PATTERNS IN A FILE                    4.6.3
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <grep> command selects and extracts lines from a file, printing only
those lines that match a given pattern. Enter the following command to print
out the lines in [/etc/passwd] that contain your login information. There
will probably be only one such line:

                             <grep login /etc/passwd>

   Be sure to replace [login] in this command with your login name. Your
output should be similar to the following:

      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      markt:0V/wE/utnUkpc:6005:104:Mark Taub, Docland:/u/markt:/bin/csh
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

   Note that whenever wildcard characters are used to specify a <grep>
search pattern, the pattern should be enclosed in single quotation marks
('). Note also that the search pattern is case sensitive. Searching for
"joe" will not yield lines containing "Joe".

   As another example, assume that you have a file named [phonelist]
that contains a name followed by a phone number on each line. Assume also
that there are several thousand lines in this list. You can use <grep>
to find the phone number of someone named Joe, whose phone number prefix
is 822, by entering the following command:

            <grep 'Joe' phonelist | grep '822-' > joes.number>

   The <grep> utility first finds all occurrences of lines containing the
word "Joe" in the file [phonelist]. The output from this command is then
filtered through another <grep> command, which searches for an "822-"
prefix, thus removing any unwanted "Joes." Finally, assuming that a
unique phone number for Joe exists with the "822-" prefix, that name and
number are placed in a the file [joes.number].

   Two other pattern searching utilities are available with XENIX. These
are <egrep> and <fgrep>. Refer to <grep(C)> in the XENIX User's Reference
for more information on these utilities.

4.6.4                COUNTING WORDS, LINES, AND CHARACTERS                4.6.4
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <wc> utility is used to count words in a file. Words are presumed to
be separated by punctuation, spaces, tabs, or newlines. In addition to
counting words, <wc> counts characters and lines.

   Use <cd> to change to your home directory. Then enter the following
command to count the lines, words, and characters in the file [men], created
in section 4.6.1:

                                   <wc men>

   The output from this command should be the following:

                          -------------------------
                          2     16    68 men
                          -------------------------

   The first number is the number of lines in [men], the second number is
the number of words and the third number is the number of characters. Remove
[men] and [women] by entering the following command:

                                  <rm *men>

   To specify a count of characters, words, or lines only, you must use
the <-c>, <-w>, or <-l> option, respectively. For example, enter the following
command to count the number of users currently logged onto the system:

                                <who | wc -l>

   The <who> command reports on who is using the system, one user per line.
The <wc -l> command counts the number of lines reported by the <who> command.
This is the number of users currently on the system.

4.7                   USING FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS                  4.7
_______________________________________________________________________________

   The XENIX system allows the owner of a file or directory to restrict
access to that file or directory. This is done with permission settings.
Permissions on a file limit who can read, write and/or execute the files.
Permissions on a directory limit who can <cd> to the directory, list the
contents of the directory, and create and delete files in the directory.

   To determine the permissions associated with a given file or directory,
use the <l> command. Use <cd> to change to your home directory and then
enter <l> to get a long listing of the files in this directory.

   Permissions are indicated by the first 10 characters of the output of
the <l> command. The first character indicates the type of file and must
be one of the following:


                -           Indicates an ordinary file.

                b           Indicates a block special device such as a
                            hard or floppy disk. Hard and floppy disks
                            can be treated as both block and character
                            special devices.

                c           Indicates a character special device such as
                            a lineprinter or terminal.

                d           Indicates a directory.

                m           Indicates a shared data file.

                n           Indicates a name special file.

                p           Indicates a named pipe.

                s           Indicates a semaphore.


   From left to right, the next nine characters are interpreted as three
sets of three permissions. Each set of three indicates the following
permissions:


                *    Owner permissions,

                *    Group permissions, and

                *    All other user permissions.


   Within each set, the three characters indicate permission to read, to
write, and to execute the file as a command, respectively. For a directory,
"execute" permission means permission to search the directory for any files
or directories.

   Ordinary file permissions have the following meanings:


                 r      The file is readable.

                 w      The file is writable.

                 x      The file is executable.

                 -      The permission is not granted.


   For directories, permissions have the following meanings:


                 r      Files can be listed in the directory; the directory
                        must also have "x" permission.

                 w      Files can be created or deleted in the directory.
                        As with "r", the directory itself must also have
                        "x" permission.

                 x      The directory can be searched. A directory must
                        have "x" permission before you can move to it with
                        the <cd> command, access a file within it, or list
                        the files in it. Remember that a user must have "x"
                        permission to do anything useful to the directory.


   The following are some typical directory permission combinations:


          d--------     No access at all. This is the mode that denies 
                        access to the directory to all users but the
                        superuser.

          drwx-----     Limits access to the owner. The owner can list the
                        contents of this directory and the files in it (if
                        they have appropriate permissions), <cd> to the
                        directory, and add files to, and delete files from,
                        the directory. This is the typical permission for
                        the owner of a directory.

          drwxr-x---    In addition to allowing the owner all of the above
                        access permissions, this setting allows group members
                        to list the contents of this directory and files within
                        it and to <cd> to this directory. However, group
                        members cannot create files in, or delete files from,
                        this directory. This is the typical permission an
                        owner gives to others who need access to files in
                        his or her directory.

          drwxr-x--x    In addition to allowing the owner and the group all
                        of the above access permissions, this setting allows
                        users other than the owner or members of the group
                        to <cd> to this directory. However, because the <r>
                        is not set for others, other users cannot list the
                        contents of this directory with any of the <ls>
                        commands. This mode is rarely used, but it can be
                        useful if you want to give someone access to a specific
                        file in a directory without revealing the presence of
                        other files in the directory.


   The [/etc] directory contains files whose permissions vary. Examine the
permissions of the files in this directory by entering the following command:

                             <l /etc | more>

_______________________________________________________________________________

   The <chmod> command changes the read, write, execute, and search permis-
sions of a file or directory. It has the form:

                        <chmod instruction filename>

   The instruction argument indicates which permissions you want to change
for which class of users. There are three classes of users, and three levels
of permissions. The users are specified as follows:


       u              User, the owner of the file or directory.

       g              Group, the group the owner of the file belongs to.

       o              Other, all users of the system who are not in u or g.

       a              All users of the system.


   The permissions are specified as follows:


       r              Read, which allows permitted users to look at but not
                      change or delete the file.

       w              Write, which allows permitted users to change or even
                      delete the file.

       x              Execute, which allows permitted users to execute the
                      file as a command.


   Use <cd> to move to your home directory. Then enter the following command
to create [tempfile]:

                             <touch tempfile>

   The permissions on [tempfile] are probably:

                                -rw-r--r--

   Verify this by entering the following command:

                               <l tempfile>

   Enter the following command to give yourself (the file's owner) execute
permissions on [tempfile]:

                           <chmod u+x tempfile>

   Verify the permissions change with the <l> command. (Of course, since
[tempfile] is neither a binary nor a script, having execute permission on
it is meaningless.)

   Enter the following command to give the group and other users write
permission on [tempfile]:

                            <chmod go+w tempfile>

   Verify the permissions change with the <l> command.

   The <chmod> command also allows you to remove permissions. For example,
enter the following command to prohibit others from writing to [tempfile]:

                             <chmod o-w tempfile>

   Remove [tempfile] with the following command:

                                <rm tempfile>

4.7.2                     CHANGING DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS                  4.7.2
_______________________________________________________________________________

   Directories also have an execute permission, even though they cannot be
executed in the same way that a script or binary file can. For directories,
the execute attribute is needed in order to do any useful work in a directory.
Users who do not have execute permission for a directory cannot <cd> to the
directory, list the names of files in the directory, or copy files to or from
the directory.

   The permissions on your home directory are probably set to the following:

                                  drwxr-xr-x

   Verify this by entering the following command:

                                 <l -d $HOME>

   You probably see output like the following:

           --------------------------------------------------------
           drwxr-xr-x  4 markt   pub     240 Feb 10 09:09  /u/markt
           --------------------------------------------------------

   This setting allows you, the directory's owner, to <cd> to the directory,
to list the contents of the directory and of the files within it (if the file
permissions also allow), and to create and delete files in the directory. This
setting also allows members of the group and other users to <cd> to the
directory, to list the directory's contents and also the contents of files
within the directory, if file permissions allow.

   To deny any useful access to others, enter the following command:

                               <chmod o-x $HOME>

   Verify that the permissions were changed with the following command:

                                  <l -d $HOME>

   Your output should look like the following:

           --------------------------------------------------------
           drwxr-xr--  4 markt   pub     240 Feb 10 09:09  /u/markt
           --------------------------------------------------------

   Now, only you and the members of the group have access to your directory.
If you want to restore access to your home directory to other users, enter the
following command:

                                <chmod o+x $HOME>

 5. END COMMENTS
 ---------------
 The European Digest will NOT cover european news. We have started a new
 series in Swedish, with such news, which will be released on the last day
 every month. So, we'll stick to this format.

 The European Digest will not feature Hacking techniques, Phreaking, Carding,
 information about government systems or the basic underground rap. It will 
 be different. It IS different. Manuals, The Underground Scene, Deep Deep
 whatever, and so on. Less 'general rag stuff' and More Miscellaneous stuff.
 Swedish Hacker News will be presented through the 'uXu - Swedish News' series,
 but ONLY in Swedish. English translations will however be published in future
 issues of the well-known underground rag, Phrack Inc.
