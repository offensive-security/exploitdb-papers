    ____________________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________________

    Kind of a special release, you might say. This is uXu file 148 -
    "Technophilia" by Ikonoklast. There won't be an index this time
    (it will be properly added to the list in the next release),
    instead, we have written some comments about Technophilia below,
    just to get you started. :) _Huge_ thanks to Ikonoklast for letting
    us publish his fantastic book through uXu! Here we go - 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

The GNN -

  The  least you could say about Technophilia is that it is a massive piece
of  work.   Still,  it is incredible readable and interesting, not only for
those  who  feel  disorientated  in  a  world  with  weird expressions like
cyberpunks, hackers, phreakers etc.  Even those who feel that they are very
well  informed about the situation will most probably find something new to
explore in this book.
  The  computer  underground  is  not something that will end up as a brief
hobby  for  a  few  individuals,  until it fades away into nothing.  We are
catching  the  train  to  the future, rapidly ahead of the common people on
planet  Earth.   This  book gives a hint of what is actually happening when
people  turn  on  their computers and uses their knowledge to achieve goals
that   most   people   do   not   even   dream  about.   The  promotion  of
decentralization,  the  mistrust  of  authority  and  the  information that
desperately wants to be free.
  What  Ikonoklast has written is not something that will be out of date in
a couple of years.  It is a history book of our time.
  Read Technophilia - and realize that you are a part of the history.


The Chief -

  What you now have received is something really special. Both for uXu and
the e-zine community. Technophilia were to be printed and released as a
book, but due to (probably) lack of knowledge and interest from the publishing
company, who argued that it would be outdated pretty fast and therefor not
worth to publish, this never happened. What I thought when I heard this
wasn't "Oh yeah, now _we_ can publish it" as I suspect some people might
think. No, I thought that "every piece of non-fiction published will
undoubtedly be outdated some day, so what makes Technophilia different?
How come they won't publish this one?" We all know that the computer
industry, research and development moves somewhat fast these days, and in
some ways perhaps a bit _too_ fast, but that doesn't mean people stop
writing manuals, reports and software does it? No, you just upgrade, or
write another one. This is such a thing. And it is needed. Wherever we're
headed, I feel the progress, the ways we have taken, must be documented,
and what better way than to write, sort of, a history book about it now and
then? I'm sure there will be several books like this one, maybe they
already exist. They're _all_ needed if we're going to get a grip on what
has happened, and what's about to come. After all, this _is_ the information
age, isn't it?


Phearless - 

 I must admit that I was somewhat impressed the first time I was browsing
 through the quite big amount of information gathered in Technophilia.
 Ikonoklast has made an excellent job, and it would be a shame to keep
 it away from the e-public. It was easy to decide, whether we should
 release this through uXu or not. It's a masterpiece, and a useful
 compilation of a wide area of interesting topics. Enjoy!

Welcome to the Internet version of Technophilia.  Originally,
this text was supposed to be an entire book, complete with
photos, illustrations, and artwork.  Also, there was much more
original writing in the previous version than in this one.  It
*would* have been published around this time, but the publishers
felt that Technophilia would have a short shelf life (or they
would have to publish an update), so they decided to can it.

But, thanks to the benevolent uXu, Technophilia has a chance to
live on! This text is very similar to the original except that I
cut out a lot of the writing and decided to sell that to
magazines. Obviously, there is no artwork in the Internet version
either. (But if you are interested in seeing it, or buying cool
cyberpunk t-shirts, contact Snow Man at
cl258@cleveland.freenet.edu).

Technophilia is divided into sections, each one focusing on
focusing on a  subculture or phenomenon devoted in some way to
the advancement of technology, love of computers, or an acute
sense of neophilia.

I hope you enjoy reading Technophilia, and get some use out of
it.  If so, my time has not been wasted!  Please feel free to
contact me at dk768@cleveland.freenet.edu if you have any
comments or questions......

                      ------------------------------

Structure of the CU
-------------------

Pirates
-------
     Software pirates are the most common of the denizens of the
computer underground.  Almost everyone who has a computer has, at
one time or another copied a program for his own use.   But that
alone does not make one a pirate.
     Pirates copy software as a hobby, even software they do not
need or will ever use.  Just the thrill of owning it is good
enough for the pirate.
     Pirates tend to be secretive and most pirate boards can be
accessed by invitation only.  Pirate BBSes often have giveaway
names, like Piate's Cove or Treasure Chest.  Most require high
speed modems 14.4K+ for the fast transfer of warez (software).
     There are also "wannabe" pirates, the warez kidz.  They call
up pirate and non-pirate bbses asking for software, but they
never upload any.
     In the upper levels of pirate-dom exists the "crackers" (not
to be confused with evil hackers).  Software crackers break the
protection scheme of software and then distribute them to the
lower pirates.
     Pirating software is in danger of becoming obsolete with new
protection schemes such as hardware plugs that connect to the
serial ports and companies beginning to ship products on CD-ROMs.
Hackers
     Once, being a hacker meant you were a professional at
getting a computer to do something amazing: whether it is to
perform a specific task or gain access to it. Nowadays, a hacker
is considered to be one of two things.  The first version, the
one newspapers, television, and magazines want you to think, is a
criminal who wants to destroy or steal computer data.  The other
version is anyone who disregards artificial boundaries, explores
systems, and believes that information should be free.
     Hackers hate artificial boundaries placed for the purpose to
deter exploration.  They have a yearning for arcane and forbidden
knowledge.
     This is distinctly different from a criminal - call them
what you will - crackers, dark side hackers : the ones that hack
for money, revenge, or personal gain.  Although this is the
description the media prefers, these types are very, very rare in
the computer underground.


Phreaks
-------
     Phreaks can be considered the oldest members of the computer
underground:  they've been around in one form or another since
the 1960's. Phreaks don't see themselves as swindlers or
defrauders - they fancy themselves "explorers."
     The phreak's area of expertise is the phone system.  Hidden
within the vast cables, switching offices, and satellites of the
telephone companies are hundreds of thousands of untapped
secrets: loops, call-backs, codes, private branch exchanges, etc.
The phone company offers a huge area to explore - and virtually
none of it tangible.
     Phreakdom has had one major setback since it began:  as the
phone company's switching systems became more modern and
computerized (such as the #5 Electronic Switching Station), the
distinction between phreaks and hackers blurred.  Many phreaks
who knew nothing about computers had to start learning them.
And, it was easier to get caught by the phone company, who now
had the power to monitor their lines.
     A watered-down phreak is known as a codez kid.  They are
wannabe phreaks or criminals who trade in free long-distance
access codes.
     Phreaks are a dying breed.  Many are frightened by the
growing complexity of the phone system and the high risks of
being caught.


Virus Writers
-------------
     Virus writers are the smallest strata of the computer
underground and some of the most technically proficient.
Usually, they are also the most malevolent: some of their
products are purposefully destructive.  This is truly sad because
their abilities could be used for studying artificial life
viruses.


Rodents/weasels/l0zers
----------------------
     The scum of the computer underground.  These are usually
teenage kids who recently received a computer with a modem and
want to do all sorts of illegal, harmful stuff.  Some of them
eventually grow up, but most remain a detriment to the entire CU
community.



Techniques of the Computer Underground
--------------------------------------

Boxing
------
     Boxing is a technique used mainly by phreaks that employs an
electronic device (most are shaped like a box) that reproduces
special tones recognizable by phone equipment.  By using these
tones, the phreak can operate phone equipment from a remote site
like an operator.  Boxing was once very popular among college
students who could call home for free.
     * red - this box produces the same tones that a coin makes
when dropped into a payphone.  By playing the tones into the
mouthpiece, the phreak tricks the phone into thinking that coins
are being deposited.  Voila!  Free long distance!
     * black - black boxes are named so because of the first one
found.  When a black box is attached to a telephone line, it
provides toll-free calling placed to that line.  It appears to
the phone company that no one ever picks up the phone, thus never
initiating billing the call.
     * blue -    Blue boxes are able to replicate the exact
frequencies the phone company used for their long distance
billing equipment and standard touch-tone keys (including some
keys that aren't on a standard phone).  This feature made them
popular with those who wished to make free calls or explore the
phone system free of charge. Blue boxes used to be the most
widely used of all boxes, but nowadays are among the most
uncommon.
     * purple - when attached to a phone line, the purple box
makes all calls made out from that location seem to be local
calls.
     * rainbow - named so because it combines almost all the
functions of other boxes, plus is usable worldwide.  The rainbow
box is the phreaks dream come true.  Once legendary, a kit for
building a rainbow box is now available from Hack-Tic magazine
(for a cool $250).
     * beige - the beige box is a telephone lineman's handset
with alligator clips that allows for tapping into the phone and
listening in.


Password grabbing (and cracking)
--------------------------------
     Any technique used to steal a password from an authorized
user.
     Popular tactics include:
     *  writing or running a program that emulates a legitimate
login screen.  After the target types in his password, he get a
typical "user authorization failure" message.  The program stores
the login name and the password.  Having done this, the program
terminates itself and dumps the user to the real login screen.
     *  Running a program that guesses common passwords, or
matches encrypted password data to a dictionary of common
passwords.
     *  Guessing personal information based on the knowledge of
that person.
     *  Looking over the shoulder (!).


Social engineering
------------------
     By sounding authoritative or knowledgeable, or by
intimidating a target, a hacker can convince many people he
should be privy to guarded information.  Likewise, being pleasant
and helpful can result in passwords, phone-numbers, or a quick
escape from the hands of authority. After all, a chain is only as
strong as it's weakest link.
     Reading telecom and computer manuals is one way to increase
social engineering skills - if you can talk like a technician,
you can fool a lot of people.
trashing - also known as "dumpster diving," trashing is the fine
art of sifting through the garbage of targeted installations
(like a Bell Office, department store, business) to find manuals,
notes, memos and documents.


Private BBSes
-------------
     Private BBSes are just like a regular BBS, except that users
must be invited or undergo an intense process of scrutiny from a
voting council.  Almost all discussion on these boards is focused
on underground activities.  Phone codes, credit card numbers,
electronic hacker magazines and "philes," plus pirated software
can be found on some private boards.
     To gain entrance into a private BBS, an applicant usually
must fill out a questionnaire filled with technical terms (to see
if he or she "knows his stuff"), plus provide a brief history of
previous activities, hacks, etc.  The applicants are judged for
their suitability by the sysop and sometimes a board of electors.
     Private BBSes tend to be clique-ish and suspicious of
applicants.  They are inclined to believe in the heuristic -
"Every third member of the computer underground is probably a fed
or an informant."


Scanning
--------
     In the computer underground, scanning can mean two things:
     *  Having a modem "war dial" a certain range of numbers
sequentially (such as 221-0000 to 221-9999) to find modem
dial-ups or long distance access code numbers.
     *  Listening to certain frequencies on an ordinary police
scanner to learn information.  Listening to cellular or cordless
phone frequencies, for instance, often leads to interesting
information.


Underground publications
------------------------
     Underground publications include philes and zines.
     Philes are often brief pieces explaining tenets of
phreaking, hacking, schematics for building boxes, bomb recipes,
or revenge tactics.  Philes tend to be written by anarchists or
people with extreme anti-social habits.
     Underground zines are usually nothing more than a number of
philes published under one banner, but are a bit more technical
and practical.  Most zines contain bust information or news of
crackdowns.


Handles
-------
     No one in the underground likes to use his real name, so
they adopt a pseudonym, or handle.
     Handles seem to fall into categories: Science
Fiction/Fantasy (like Atreides, Black Knight, Gandalf), Technical
(C.H.Mainframe, Doc Digital), Anti-Social (The Vandal, Trouble),
and Comical (DrunkFux, Whiz Bang).  Heavy metal music and occult
themes are also popular inspirations for handles.
     Its considered tacky to steal a handle, especially a well
known one, or to have multiple handles at the same time.
     People with the same handles often are referred to by their
area code (Executioner 212 and Executioner 312).


Credit card fraud
-----------------
     Stealing credit card numbers for the purpose of charging
desired merchandise, most likely delivered to a maildrop. Credit
card vandals get numbers from a variety of places - carbons from
department store trash, from underground BBSes, from listening in
on phone lines, or outright stealing the cards.
     Credit card fraud was once popular among the computer
underground, but is now avoided and looked down on.  Users who
post credit card numbers on bulletin boards are usually kicked
off the BBS, since sysops run the risk of getting arrested.


Fed
---
 derogatory term that is used by hackers to describe anyone who
is either a federal agent (SS or FBI), police office, or a
security professional.  Often it can mean anyone who is
outspokenly against hackers.  "Fed Boards" or sting boards are
BBSes disguised as private boards, but in reality are set up to
catch or monitor hackers.


Trends
------
 as technology changes and advances forward, hacking, pirating,
and phreaking will follow.  The blue boxes and simple diskcopy
will fall by the wayside as security methods "catch up."
Hacking, too, will catch up with some certain technologies.
Here's some topics that are currently hot:
     *  mag strip hacking - everyone has a few cards with these
ferromagnetic strips on them - ATM cards, credit cards, and photo
IDs.  It is possible to rig a machine that can read and decode
(and possibly write) the hidden messages encoded on them.  If the
US Government is ever stupid enough to issue "smart cards,"
knowledge of this field will come in handy.
     *  portable hacking - it hasn't been safe to hack from one's
home for quite awhile, and the cost (and size) of laptops with
internal modems make hacking on the road an appealing alternative
to many.
     *  digital signatures - personalized digital imprinting
(fingerprints, voice, and handwriting recognition) is becoming
popular in certain levels of the government and large
corporations.  It is only a matter of time before this form of ID
descends to the masses.
     *  cryptography - cryptography is the process of encoding e-
mail messages or files that can only be opened up by someone who
has the "key."  Some crypto programs that are widely available
today are so advanced they are nearly unbreakable.  This makes
the government unhappy, because they want to be able to read
anything they wish (in the interest of national security, of
course).  The government has proposed a uniform crypto program
where they would hold a universal "key."  If this ever is the
situation, God forbid, rest assure that hackers will try to get a
key as well.
     *  answering machine hacking - almost everyone has an
answering machine these days.  And guess what?  Most can be
accessed remotely with a certain combination punched into the
telephone keypad.  You can listen to messages, or on some models,
record a new message.  It is possible to program an ordinary
Radio Shack tone dialer to try every two digit combination.
     *  hardware pirating - the software companies have decided
that diskcopying has gotten out of hand.  Past protection schemes
have proved to be ineffective.  Now there is a hardware
protection craze that the software companies are picking up on:
instead of writing protection schemes into the software, the
software is shipped with special devices that fit into serial
ports.  The software cannot run unless it has one of the special
devices.



                   Computer Underground Magazines
                ------------------------------------

Iron Feather Journal
POB 1905
Boulder CO
80306-1905
     Iron Feather Journal is filled with bizarre graphics and
tons of techno-thug info.  IFJ was started back in the days of
Commodore 64 hacking, but now covers the world of Internet and
other electronic things.  Lists of FTP sites, Usenet groups, and
tech schematics (including how to build your own pirate
television station), are interspersed with rambling writings and
clippings from old computer catalogs.  The High Tech Contact area
is of great value: it has listings of free catalogs, free
newsletters, and listings of BBSes.  Each issue is $2.50-3.00.
     The editor, Stevyn, also runs a scion of IFJ:  Phunshit
Catalog, which sells old issues of IFJ, hacking and cyberpunk
books and magazines, a clippings from Usenet groups.


2600
POB 752
Middle Island NY
11953
     Absolutely the best hard copy hacker magazine.  Articles
range from phone company switching system programming to cellular
hacking to defeating Simplex locks.  Editor Emmanuel Goldstein is
one of those rare editors that uses the freedom of the press to
the utmost: always a step ahead of those that would like to see
him jailed.
     2600 also offers a video of Dutch hackers breaking into a
military computer.  Excerpts of this video were shown on
"journalist" Geraldo Rivera's sensationalist TV show.  The video
is $10.00.
     2600 operates a voice BBS (0700-751-2600 0.15/minute) which
is open from 11 PM to 7 AM every day.
     2600 holds meetings in many major US cities every first
Friday of the month.  See the current issue for listings.
     Subscriptions (four issues) are $21.00 (US and Canada);
$30.00 (foreign).


TAP
POB 20264
Louisville KY
40250-0264
     TAP, or the Technical Assistance Program, has been in
(erratic) publication since 1973.  It was originally titled Youth
International Party Line (YIPL) after it's founders Yippie Abbie
Hoffman and phone phreak Al Bell.  TAP published articles on
scams, concentrating particularly on phone fraud.  TAP stopped
publishing for a while when then-publisher Thomas Edison's house
was set on fire and computer stolen.  TAP was then resurrected
several times before it came to rest with Predat0r in 1990.
     Each issue is $2.00, but send a letter before any money -
issues have come out erratically.


Intertek
13 Daffodil Lane
San Carlos CA
94070
     The journal of Technology and Society.  Past issues have
included articles on virtual communities (MUDs, IRC and such),
Internet culture, and hacking.

Hack-Tic
PB 22953, 1100 DL
Amsterdam
Netherlands
     Hack-Tic is the Dutch equivalent of 2600 Magazine.  Mostly
written in Dutch, HT contains articles on phone phreaking and
hacking in Europe (in the Netherlands it isn't a crime. Yet.).
     Hack-Tic also sells the Demon Dialer rainbow box kit for
$250.
     They also sponsor the Galactic Hacker's Party, a worldwide
gathering of phreaks, cyberpunks, and hackers.
     Each issue of Hack-Tic is $2.50.


Chaos Computer Club
Schwenckestrasse 85
W-2000 Hamburg 20
Germany
     The CCC is one of the most notorious hacker gangs in the
world, and claim responsibility for all sorts of break-ins into
the US Government's computer systems.  One of their supposed
members was the villain in Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg.
     They sell their secrets in Die Hacker Bibel Volumes 1, 2,
and 3, and Das Chaos Computer Buch, plus other software programs.
Catalog is free, but it is written in German, so good luck.
Associating with these folks will probably land you on a
government watch list.
     Chaos Computer Club has two Internet archives:

     Phrack is the undisputed king of the electronic hacker
magazines.  Each huge issue (some are over 720K!) has detailed
technical information on selected computer systems or phone
equipment, a question and answer letters section, and articles on
freedom and privacy in cyberspace.  Phrack also has the Pro-Phile
-an in-depth look at some of the most notorious hackers, and
Phrack World News, a collection of newsclippings dealing with the
computer underground.
     Phrack is just to good to pass up - get it while it (and the
editor and writers!) is still free.

Computer Underground Digest
tk0jut2@niu.bitnet
     The Computer Underground Digest, or CuD as it is called by
its readers, is a weekly electronic news journal.  It's
beginnings stem back to early 1990, when Telecom Digest was
inundated with posts about the recent Knight Lightning and
Terminus indictments.  Jim Thomas, a professor of sociology and
criminology at Northern Illinois University, and Gordon Meyer,
author of "The Social Organization of the Computer Underground,"
collected the excess posts and published them under the banner of
CuD.
     The goal of CuD, according to its founders, is to provide a
forum for discussion and debate of the computer
telecommunications culture, with special emphasis on alternative
groups that exist outside the conventional computer network
community.
     CuD publishes:
     *  Reasoned and thoughtful debates about economic, ethical,
legal, and other issues related to the computer underground.
     *  Verbatim printed newspaper or magazine articles
containing relevant stories.
     *  Public domain legal documents including affidavits,
indictments, and court records that pertain to the computer
underground.
     *  General discussion of news, problems, and other issues
that contributors feel should be aired.
     *  Unpublished academic pieces or research results.
     *  Book reviews that address the social implications of
computer technology
     *  Announcements for meetings, conferences, etc.
(from the Computer Underground Digest FAQ).

                  --------------------------------

The Hacker Crackdown by Bruce Sterling
     The Hacker Crackdown is cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling's
first foray into non-fiction writing.   Crackdown is an account
of the government crackdown on the computer underground in the
early 1990's.  Includes a brief history of the telephone
industry, events that led up to "Operation Sundevil," the
Phrack/Bellsouth E911 fiasco, the trials that followed, and the
formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Highly
recommended.


Cyberpunk by Katie Hafner and John Markoff
     Three stories written by news reporters about computer
hackers.
     The first story is about Kevin Mitnick and friends'
exploits.
The authors' dislike of Mitnick is obvious, describing in detail
Mitnick's character flaws, and makes personal digs at him
whenever possible.
     The next story is about Pengo, the German hacker who offered
to sell his (and his friends') talents to the Russians.
     Finally, the last chapter tells the story of Robert T.
Morris, author of the Internet Worm.
     Although somewhat biased, Cyberpunk!, like The Cuckoo's Egg,
is a must-read for those interested in hackers.


The Official Phreaker's Manual
     This is the Bible of Phreakdom; includes terms and
techniques (most outdated by now, but it gets the methods and
possibilities across quite well).  There's a bit of history
thrown in - it contains the 1971 Esquire article about Capn
Crunch and his blue boxes.  This manual brings back a lot of
nostalgia, but I wouldn't use the tactics inside.
     Available free on ftp.eff.org /pub/cud/misc.


Hackers by Stephen Levy
     Hackers is the story of the true hackers - the geniuses
responsible for the personal computer revolution.
     The beginning of Hackers is about the first generation -
students at MIT who formed a loose alliance and wrote amazingly
clever programs on the facility's mainframes and minicomputers.
The first generation were the ones that introduced the extremely
anti-bureaucratic "Hacker Ethic" - the idea that computer should
always be accessible, that artificial boundaries (including
locked doors and closed buildings) should be overcome, and that
"authority" should be mistrusted.
     The second part is devoted to the second generation. These
people were responsible for the birth of the personal computer,
including Jobs and Wozniak, the Altair, and the Homebrew Computer
Club.  The second wave of hackers established the Do It Yourself
attitude, and for the most part began the Computer Revolution.
     The last part of the book is about the third generation of
hackers.  These were the software writers and programming
geniuses, and the WarGames-era dark side hackers.  The third
generation was responsible for turning the PC from a hobbyist's
toy to a household appliance.


The Anarchist's Guide to the BBS by Keith Wade
     Describes in detail modems, protocols, and everything you
need to start up your own anarchy BBS.  Explains terms and
techniques, excellent for beginners to the modem world.


The Hacker's Dictionary by Guy Steel, Jr
     Terms and words used by programmers and true hackers.  Media
and security "experts" will be disappointed in this book, but
those who find computers and computer history will find it
entertaining.


The Cuckoo's Egg by Cliff Stoll
     Cliff Stoll, an astrophysicist turned computer manager at
Lawrence Berkeley Lab, narrates the true story of how he traced a
75 cent accounting error to a hacker who was breaking into the
LBL system.  The situation escalates as the hacker travels
through the Internet, breaking into sensitive American computers
and stealing military and R&D information to sell to the Russian.
Stoll tracks the hacker through Berkeley's system, computer
networks throughout the country, and the globe-spanning, tangled
web of the phone networks.
     This is one of the best books of high tech espionage, and a
decent primer on Internet jargon.  Highly recommended.


Computer Viruses: A High Tech Disease by Ralf Burger
     Contains information on how viruses work and how they
reproduce themselves.


Spectacular Computer Crimes by Buck Bloombecker
     Mr. Bloombecker is the director for the National Center for
Computer Crime Data, so you already know what he thinks about
hackers.  Spectacular Computer Crimes is a somewhat slanted
collection of true stories on hackers, thieves, and assorted
techno-troublemakers.


Approaching Zero by Paul Mungo and Bryan Clough
     Yet another book on hackers by a journalist.
     Narrative chronicles of the computer underground.  Includes
the deeds and antics of several legendary hackers, including
Cap'n Crunch, Captain Zap, Fry Guy, Pengo, and virus writer Dark
Avenger.
     A good if somewhat basic overview of the alternative
computer culture.

                            The "Feds"
                         ----------------

     Someone has to watch the networks and computer systems in
case of trouble.  Until lately, the responsibility of insuring
safety on systems was up to the provider of the system - the
government would have nothing to do with it.  That is until
computers became so prevalent (especially in large financial
institutions, military installations, and national databanks)
that it was necessary to have some sort of policing.  The brunt
of this police work seems to have fallen on the Secret Service,
perhaps because of their ties with the Federal Reserve.
     In any case, security people, whether corporate, private, or
government, are generally nice folks.  It's their job, and we
should all feel somewhat indebted to them for keeping the
networks and systems trouble free.
       Unfortunately, some can be overzealous and zero in on
mischievous teenagers rather than real criminals.  Others break
the fine line between a breach of privacy and "national
interest."  Such was the case of the Steve Jackson Games raid.

these five principles:
- "We foster and support public discussion of and public
responsibility for decisions involving the use of computers in
systems critical to society.
- We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
technological systems
- We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve
political and social problems.

computer profession, nationally and internationally.
- We encourage the use of computer technology to improve the
quality of life."

concern for the agency who is supposed to guard the President is
anyone's guess.
     If you decide to write to the SS about computer crime or
hackers, they might be hesitant to reveal anything at first.  Be
persistent, send some Freedom of Information requests, whatever.
Who knows?  They may budge.  But then again, don't blame me if

     "The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in July,
1990, to assure freedom of expression in digital media, with a
particular emphasis on applying the principles embodied in the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights to computer-based
communication.
     From the beginning, EFF was determined to become an
organized voice for the burgeoning community of nationally and
internationally networked computer users.  We perform the
multiple roles of guardian, advocate, and innovator, to serve and
protect the public interest in the information age.
     We have defended civil liberties in court.  We have shaped
the policy debate on emerging communications infrastructure and
regulation.  We have increased awareness both on the Net and
among those law enforcement officials, policy makers, and
corporations whose insufficient understanding of the digital
environment threatened the freedom of Cyberspace.  Yet there is
still much to be done."  (From General Information about the
EFF).
     The EFF was founded in part by Mitch Kapor, inventor of the
Lotus spreadsheet package.  The EFF's most famous case was the
Phrack/E911/Knight Lightening case, which they won.
     Membership to the EFF is $20.00 for students and low-income

                            Cyberpunk
                         ---------------

     The term "cyberpunk" was coined in 1980 by a science fiction
writer, Bruce Bethke.  He used it as the title of a story he had
written about a suburban hacker gang.  Later, the term was used
to describe a particular style of science fiction writing,
specifically the works of John Shirley, Bruce Sterling, and
William Gibson.
     Also in the early 1980's, a flurry of science fiction movies
hit the screen: Tron, Wargames, The Road Warrior, and Blade
Runner.  These films, like the stories of the cyberpunk authors,
weren't just fanciful visions of the future, ala Star Wars or
Star Trek.  These works had a basis in reality - they were more
or less magnifications of what was already happening around us.
     The early 1980's was also the first major onslaught of the
home computer industry. Computing power increased and prices
dropped.  Commercials suggested that children would get a "head
start" if they had their own computers.  As a result, thousands
of people bought computers for their children.  Many of these
computer users, who were mainly suburban white males,
incidentally, owned modems and communicated on bulletin boards.
Influenced by WarGames and other films, some of the modemers
joined mischievous computer gangs - echoing Bethke's original
intent for cyberpunk.
     As computer crime became more prevalent, the media couldn't
pass up a perfect term like cyberpunk.  It conjured up images of
high-tech bandits, computer street gangs, or nerds gone bad -
this made good news.  So the hacker community was the next group
to be labeled "cyberpunk."
     As the hacker counterculture matured, they combined their
technological abilities, anti-establishment feelings, and their
newfound sense of identity and created a entirely new subculture
- the "cyberpunks."
     The cyberpunks communicated on BBSes and the Internet, and
were fueled on by the early issues of Mondo 2000 and bOING bOING.
Through a medley of media stunts, a rampant fear of the computer
unerground, and a popularization of new technologies, the media
has recently brought the cyberpunks into the limelight.



     Gareth Branwyn (author of the Beyond Cyberpunk! hypercard
stack)  posted the following description of cyberpunks to the
WELL:

A) The future has imploded into the present.  There was no
   nuclear Armageddon.  There's too much real estate to lose.
   The new battlefield is peoples' minds.
B) The megacorps are the new governments.
C) The U.S. is a big bully with lackluster economic power.
D) The world is splintering into a trillion subcultures and
   designer cults with their own languages, codes, and
   lifestyles.
E) Computer generated info-domains are the next frontiers.
F) There is better living through chemistry.
G) Small groups or individual "console cowboys" can wield
   tremendous power over governments, corporations, etc.
H) The coalescence of a computer "culture" is expressed in self-
   aware computer music, art, virtual communities, and a
   hacker/street tech subculture.  The computer nerd image is
   passe, and people are not ashamed anymore about the role the
   computer has in this subculture.  The computer is a cool
   tool, a friend, important human augmentation.
I) We're becoming cyborgs.  Our tech is getting smaller, closer
   to us, and it will soon merge with us.
J) Some attitudes that seem to be related:
     - Information wants to be free
     - Access to computers and anything which may teach you
       something about how the world works should be unlimited and
       total.
     - Always yield to the hands-on imperative.
     - Mistrust authority.
     - Promote decentralization.
     - Do it yourself.
     - Fight the power.
     - Feed the noise back into the system.
     - Surf the edges.

             Cyberpunk:  From Subculture to Mainstream
                       by McKenzie Wark
               ----------------------------------

     A hip new lingo has infiltrated the mass media.
"Cyberspace," "hypermedia," and "virtual reality" have become the
techno buzz words of the 90's.  After years of indifference and
suspicion, the idea that technology can be fun, exciting, and
sexy has surfaced again.
     Two ideas in particular are now doing the rounds.  One is
that computers are not just for pencil-head types in lab coats
and grey- suited accountants.  Technology can be a tool for the
imagination, opening up new terrains of images, sounds,
experiences, and concepts.  The second idea has less to do with
computers than with communications.  By linking up all the of the
computing power languishing on desks and in basements, whole new
forms of interaction are possible - a communications revolution
to take beyond the television age.
     The first of these two ideas orbits somewhere around the
term virtual reality.  The second is a vague nebula of
possibilities sighted off the cyberspace cluster.  Both have been
around for a long time, but have recrystallized in the public's
imagination.  "Hypermedia" is the next phase in marketing this
dream to the public.  The movie Lawnmower Man has cashed in on
the trend, pulping the whole lot together with some silly old
Stephen King haunted house cliches.  The really interesting stuff
on both these current trends can be found a little off the
mainstream.  Take a hyperspace bypass back through the cyberpunk
subculture of the 80's, and you will find the creative source and
force behind the present multimedia marketing push.
     Cyberpunk is a cute name for a rather motley collection of
people who thought and wrote and made art about technology over
the last decade.  Some of them were harmless.  Some of them were
mad, bad, and dangerous to know.  Like many other prophetic art
avant- gardes in the past, they saw the future both more clearly
and more crazily than their contemporaries.  Like the romantic
poets and the decadent artists of the 19th century; like the
surrealists, futurists, and constructivists of the early 20th
century, they wanted to change life.  So they imagined how it
could be different, not only from the present, but from how the
future was officially imagined to be.
     Cyberpunk gathered momentum in 1984 with the publication of
the first of William Gibson's novels, called Neuromancer.  Gibson
has since published four novels and a collection of stories.
There are half a dozen of cyberpunk readers on the market, and
now other writers like Bruce Sterling and Pat Cadigan have
emerged.  There is even a remarkable "overground" cyberpunk
magazine called Mondo 2000, as well as a host of tiny desktop
published fanzines.  Cyberpunk has gone beyond a subculture and
is now a full blown marketing category.
     Gibson was an odd sort of person to launch an avant garde
cultural movement.  He wrote pretty pulpy science fiction novels.
He was a small-town, white-suburban kind of guy.  Yet he was able
to crystallize something that was in the air.  He took bleak,
"no- future" landscape of punk rock and post-apocalyptic movies
like Blade Runner and Mad Max, and imagined a way to escape from
the street-level violence these films referred to.  The way out
was cyberspace.
     In Gibson's world, cyberspace is a consensual hallucination
created within the dense matrix of computer networks.  Gibson
imagines a world where people can directly jack their nervous
systems into the net, vastly increasing the intimacy of the
connection between mind and matrix.  Cyberspace is the world
created by the intersection of every "jacked-in" consciousness,
every database and installation, every form of interconnected
information circuit, in short, human or inhuman.
     This mythology of cyberspace is interesting for two reasons.
Firstly, it provides an alternative to the boredom of suburbia
without having to deal with the danger of the inner-city living.
Every subculture needs a fantasy place to run away from suburban
life, be it the rural fantasy of the hippies or the urban fantasy
of the punk.  Cyberspace is a fantasy destination for white,
middle class suburbanites who realize that rural life is even
more boring than the suburbs and the cities are becoming far too
dangerous,  The other interesting thing about cyberspace is the
way it recreates the idea of a community.  Every subculture needs
an image of an outsider's community to cling to, to run to.  For
the cyberpunk, this community doesn't actually have a place.  It
is not a nightclub in New York.  It is not a street in London.
It can be accessed everywhere by modem.  Of course, the bulletin
boards and e-mail systems are a poor imitation of the fully
wired-up world of cyberspace, but it's the nearest thing on
earth.  Cyberpunk subculture is the first subculture which
doesn't have a particular place of congregation - it's a suburban
phenomenon made possible by the networks.  There are now hundreds
of bulletin boards around the world which have a cyberpunk style,
where young cyberpunks discuss the latest hardware and software.
     In a sense, subcultures are always a product of the media
technology of the age.  The classic subcultures of the 60's and
70's, from the mods to the punks, were a combination of the
electric world of rock and roll with a style and a place and an
ethos and a certain amount of drug abuse.  The mods grew out of
the 50's austerity in Britain.  They were the first generation of
young people to enter mass white-collar employment and acquire a
disposable income at a young age.  So they spent it on clothes
and music and motor scooters and weekend trips to the seaside.
They were a mobile community, growing up on television and rock
and roll.  The first great pop music TV show, Ready, Steady, Go!,
spread mod style from one end of Britain to the other instantly,
a fashion transformation that without television would have taken
months or years.
     The punk movements of the late 70's were where the youth
subcultures launched by the mods finally crash landed.  Punk was
a subculture based on the boredom of unemployment, not the tedium
of white collar work.  It lacked the excitement and innocence of
the mods, who were absolute beginners in the art of living in a
consumerist, media saturated world.  Punk was a subculture
created by young people in the late 70's who grew up on the media
and its promises of a good life, and were bored with all that.
It had let them down:  "career opportunities, the ones that never
knock" as a song from the time put it.  The punks took the media
technology of the time - the music, the fashion, the radio and
video - and trashed it.
     Cyberpunk grew out of this negative subcultural style, but
turned it back to a positive celebration.  Where the mods had
been fascinated by consumerism and the mass media, cyberpunk is
fascinated with the media technologies which were hitting the
mass market in the 80's.  Desktop publishing, computer music, and
now desktop video are technologies taken up with enthusiasm by
cyberpunks in the place of rock and roll.  Computer networking is
its alternative to the mods' pop TV or the punks' pirate radio.
Just as subcultures from mod to punk were the testing ground for
new styles of music and fashion, the cyberpunk crowd are the
testing ground for new fashions in desk-top technology.  The
rapid evolution from video games to virtual reality has been
helped along by the hard core of enthusiasts eager to try out
each generation of simulated experience.  The multimedia
convergence of the publishing industry, the computer industry,
and the recording industry has a spot right at its center called
cyberpunk, where these new product experiments find a critical
but playful market.
     Where punk was a product of unemployment and the English art
school, cyberpunk is a product of the huge array of the technical
and scientific universities created in the US to service the
military industrial complex.  Your typical cyberpunk is white,
middle class, suburban, and technically skilled.  They are a new
generation of white collar worker, resisting the yoke of work and
suburban life for awhile.  They don't drop out, they jack in.
They are a fabulous example of how each generation, growing up
with a given level of media technology, has to discover the
limits and potentials of that technology by experimenting with
everyday life itself.
     Subcultures are an art form.  They can have their delinquent
edge, its true.  Mods took too many amphetamines.  Punks were a
little prone to rioting.  Cyberpunks sometimes have a romantic
fascination with hacking into other people's computers.  All this
is a testing of limits, a pushing to the limit of the social
norm.  The enduring product of any subculture is a rapid
innovation in popular style.  Subcultures pioneer styles of life
for the mainstream.  In the case of cyberpunk, the networked
world of cyberspace.  the interactive world of multimedia, and
the new sensoria of virtual reality will all owe a little to
their willingness to be test pigs for these emergent
technologies.
     There is also a tension in cyberpunk between the military
industrial monster that produces technology and the sensibility
of the technically skilled individual trained for the high tech
machine.  Like all subcultures, cyberpunk expresses a conflict.
On the one side is the libertarian idea that technology can be a
way of wresting a little domain of freedom for people from the
necessity to work and live under the constraints of today.  On
the other is the fact that the technologies of virtual reality,
multimedia, cyberspace would never have existed in the first
place had the Pentagon not funded them as tools of war.  The
pilots who bombed Baghdad flew in virtual reality.
     Even the peaceful applications of these technologies can be
subordinated to commercial imperatives abhorrent to the free
thinking cyberpunk.  There is a contradiction between the spirit
of free enquiry and experiment and the need to keep corporate
secrets and make a buck.  Cyberpunk is a reflection of this
contradiction - on the one hand, it is a drop-out culture
dedicated to pursuing the dream of freedom through appropriate
technology.  On the other it is a ready market for new gadgets
and a training ground for hip new entrepreneurs with hi-tech toys
to market.  Cyberpunk may be over a subculture.  It was
reabsorbed into the mainstream like every other subculture before
it.  Yet it signals a fundamental change in the way subcultures
can form and oppose themselves to the mainstream.  In effect,
cyberpunk was the realization that the new generation of media
tools are also excellent resources for changing life, if only on
the margins, and if only for a short while.  Like all the other
avant-gardes and subcultures before it, it has added something
special to the repertoire of postmodern life.



                        Cyberpunk Fashion
                     -----------------------

Corp-Wear
     In a cyberpunk world, the governors of Reality are the mega-
corporations.  They are not specialized like most of today's
companies; they have a hand in everything.  Take a look at Sony
for example.  Here is a company that has business in both the
electronic and the entertainment market.  Mega-corps like Sony
have laid the groundwork to eventually envelop the fashion world.
Clothing and accessories that have nothing in common with the
company will be emblazoned with their logos - and all in the name
of fashion.  Remember the Coca-Cola clothing line a few years
back?
     Beat 'em to the punch by writing to some of the below
companies.  Tell them how much you love their products.  Ask them
for t-shirts, hats, stickers, folders, whatever.  Some companies
have premiums if you send them proofs of purchase, too.  Since
most people never do this, they often have a lot of surplus.
They'd love to get rid of some of this stuff!
     And once you get some cool items, bootleg them and give
(sell?) them to your friends.

NEC
280 Park Ave, 21 East
New York NY
10017
     NEC is in the process of developing a line of wearable
computers, each designed for different tasks or lifestyles.
     The TLC PC, which was designed with medical professionals in
mind, is a hands-off computer that includes an 8 mm camera, a CD-
ROM medical encyclopedia linked to a small microphone (so the CD
can match up a patient's condition to the symptoms contained in
the database), a satellite communications link which can transmit
the video and patient data to the hospital while the patient is
en route.
     The Wearable Data Terminal is equipped with an optical
scanner on the forearm, which is connected to a CD-ROM worn
around the neck.  The LCD screen in the neckpiece is in easy view
of the user. This computer was designed for inventory checking,
etc.
     The Lapbody Computer hangs from the shoulder like a purse,
but swings out and rests in front of the chest when needed.
     The Porto-Office combines a keyboard, handwriting pad,
cellular speakerphone and headphones, plus a camera and a fax.
     NEC is also developing a wearable video camera (the
WearCam), a breathing info-monitor, and a "Hands-Off" wrist
telephone.
     While the wristphone is available now, the wearable
computers will be available commercially in late 1994.

Mondo 2000
PO Box 10171
Berkeley CA
94709-5171
     The ancestor of the Berkeley magazine High Frontiers and its
counterpart newsletter Reality Hackers, Mondo 2000 is the journal
of the cyberpunk layman.  Produced on a MacIntosh and printed on
glossy color pages, Mondo 2000 is certainly entertaining to flip
through. The best and most practical articles are the Street Tech
columns, where instructions for homebrew electronic gizmos and
contacts for tech equipment can be found.
     Fill Mondo 2000's pockets with $24.95 to receive five
issues.  Single copies are $5.95 and can be found at most any
bookstore (even corp giant Waldenbooks carries Mondo).
     Mondo recently published a book of reprinted articles from
old issues, titled Mondo 2000:  The User's Guide to the New Edge.
The Guide is encyclopedic in nature, and has entries on
everything "New Edge" - from aphrodisiacs to hackers, house music
and media pranks.  ($20.00 from HarperCollins).
     Mondo has conference rooms on both the Well and Mindvox
(bulletin board systems).


bOING bOING
11288 Ventura Blvd.#818
Studio City CA
91604
     Similar to Mondo, but in black and white and better
articles.  Self-titled "The World's Greatest Neurozine," and it
pretty much is just that.  The writing is consistently good, and
articles like Gareth Branwyn's (the author of the Beyond
Cyberpunk! Hypercard Stack) "Going Gaga" are extraordinarily
well-written and informative.  bOING bOING is somewhat of a humor
mag - regular contributor Paco Xander Nathan describes it as,
"Mad Magazine meets Mad Max).  A recent issue lampooned Mondo
2000's layout and writing style.
     bOING bOING fills its pages with bizarre comix, extensive
zine, music, and catalog reviews.  bb is easily worth the $3.95
cover price, and $14.00 for a subscription is a steal.


WIRED
544 SecondSStreet
San Francisco CA
94107
     The personalities who Mondo and bb were writing about
decided to get together and start their own magazine.  WIRED
rivals Mondo in production - full color pages and a lot of
goofy-looking "creative imaging" photographs (All those
light-colored fuzzy photos hurt my eyes!)
     The contributing staff reads like a cyberpunk role call:
Stewart Brand (Whole Earth Review), John Markoff (author of
Cyberpunk), Bruce Sterling, and Nicholas Negroponte (MIT Media
Lab).  Rest assured the articles' content is substantial.
     There is a cool section called "Fetish" that showcases the
latest high-tech gadgets, and a relatively new section dedicated
to finding the best Internet sources.
     Although new on the scene, WIRED is definitely going to be a
contender, just because of the established contributors and its
financial backing.   But it just seems to be a bit too mainstream
and polished (most ads came from affluent companies like Seagate,
Apple, and AT&T) to have that "real cyberpunk" feel to it.
Excellent for any techno-fetishist, though.
     4.95 for an issue, 19.95 for six.


The Hardcore
PO Box 1893
London N98 JT36
UK
     The editor of The Hardcore  describes the magazine as:
  1)  Fascinated by technology
  2)  Ceaselessly contextualising ideas
  3)  Obsessive information addicts
  4)  Habitually chronic
  5)  Culturally diverse
  6)  Politically incorrect
  7)  Nexus of post-industrial ennui, cyberpunk, tech-angst
     In the past, The Hardcore has covered:  the death of
cyberpunk, chaos science/majick, SF feminism, comics,
techno-erotic film, and pyro-memetic fiction (?!?).
     Future issues will deal with: the death of virtual reality,
artificial life, cyberbooks, and artificial religion.
     Single issues are L2.00 or $4.00.  Subscriptions are
L8.00/$16 (surface) or L10.00/$20.00 (air).


Black Ice
PO Box 1069
Brighton BN2 4YT
UK
     Another c-p zine from the UK.  According to the front page,
Black Ice will regularly feature virtual reality, future
television, smart drugs, innovative computer technology,
multimedia, arcades and video games, Japanese culture,
alternative science and technology, street tech, hackers and
crackers.  The first issue has articles on Japanese junk food, an
interview with Stelarc, an interview with the director of the
British-based W. Industries (the VR-entertainment corp), and
Hi-Res Media.  This zine is amazing!  L3.95 for a single issue,
L19.95 year (4 issues).  This is really worth it!


FLUX

200 Market Street #a-21
Lowell MA

     The Future Was Now.  Or so says the cover of this small,
desktop-published zine.  FLUX focuses on the central theme of
continuing change.  The latest installment includes articles on
desktop terrorism (which is the relative ease of counterfeiting
using laser printers, scanners, and drawing programs) and "The
Great Work" by John Perry Barlow.  Future issues will have
articles on building your own flotation tank and a guide to
Internet resources.  One issue is $4.00 and a four issue
subscription is $15.00.


Future Sex

1095 Market Street
San Francisco CA

     What's next????
     This is true cyberpunk - the blending of exalted high
technology with sleaze.
     From their editorial statement:
     "Dangerously intelligent, fearlessly creative and
shamelessly sexy, Future Sex magazine reflects the evolution of
eroticism in the 90s.  Created by men and women, Future Sex
slices up the predictable and heads for the sexual frontier.
     Future Sex spotlights the fusion of sex and technology.
We're the only erotic magazine that explores how high technology
is changing the way we think about sex.  Future Sex also
investigates the sexual side of every subject from telepresence
to pop culture.  Feature writings by established futurologists,

Talking Raven: The Journal of Imaginative Trouble
PO Box 45758
Seattle WA
98145
     Not really a c-p zine, but listed here because it touches on
attitudes similar to cyberpunk.  Each issue is carried by a theme
which the editor, Antero Alli (the brilliant author of Angel Tech
and other books), feels "mirrors a critical current or socio-
political atmosphere but through the sieve of imagination."  The
entire Summer Solstice 1992 issue is devoted entirely to the
debunking of cyberpunk.
     A dollar or so will do for an issue.
     Reproduced here is a cyberpunk rant from that issue:

     Cyberpunk Thing

     It seems to be a truism that the real things in life are
beyond me.  The stunning people I see on the way down the street
are precisely the people I will never meet; the brilliant
conversations are the ones I will never have.  So it is with
cyberpunk.
     I would like to think of myself as an anarchist and I have a
computer - so this stuff should appeal to me.  But the whole
thing alienates me.  I think William Gibson is tedious and I got
bored a half an hour into Blade Runner.  I miss the point.  So
you can create "virtual reality" on your computer.  So what?
Huge amounts of memory are used drawing pretty things on the
screen.  Neat.  But does it change the world?  I don't think so -
the world just gets worse.
     I think cyberpunk is the latest attempt by American hipsters
to escape the squalid intellectual climate that surrounds them.
This is not a bad goal.  When leading "intellectuals" worry about
the nuclear capability of Iraq or the ethical problems of Yuppie
couples adopting kids (while most of the world starves or is shot
at) there is need for escape.  Similar escapist mentality has
united all of American counterculture since World War II.  The
Beats sought escape on the road while taking benzedrine, the
hippies in acid and happy thoughts, the punks in cocaine and fast
music - now the cyberpunks inside of their computers.
     But there is a catch.  You can't really get inside your
computer.  Playing interactive sex games is not the same as the
real thing.  Nobody really improves their life by hacking, and
making a few phone calls on somebody else's account is not the
same as a revolution.  And not that many people have computers
anyway.  Not nearly as many to fulfill the anarchist dream of
paralyzing authority.
     Street-wise ghetto kids aren't into computers.  Real "punks"
don't spend their money on software - they spend it on cigarettes
and hardcore shows.  I suspect that most of these "cyberpunks"
are privileged white professionals who think Brian Eno is
dangerous music.
     The thing is, I agree with these people.  I think they raise
interesting points.  The flow of information through hi-tech
machines is fascinating.  And I wish I could fuck up the pigs
through ny computer.  I wish that psychedelic drugs actually did
something beyond making me happy for a day or two.  I wish I
could leave this ugly-piece-of-shit world and live inside my
computer.  But I can't, and that is the tragedy of cyberpunk - it
doesn't exist.  The technology isn't that useful.  If anything,
all these computer chips shrink personal freedom, not expand it.
     The most surprising thing about computers is how little they
have changed anything.  For all the progress they have made in
the past decade and despite the fact that they are ubiquitous -
they haven't changed anything at all.  Offices may have computers
now, but they do the same thing.  Secretaries, cops, and
thousands of other workers punch into computers everyday, but
they still do the same job.  A memo is still a memo, no matter if
it has been written on a typewriter or a computer.  The
institutions have remained unchanged.  Work may be faster or
easier, but it is still work.  Unlike the automobile, which
changed the landscape, or telephones that linked the world:
computers only do old things.  If history is the study of change,
then computers are ahistorical - like the fancy and useless
gizmos made by French artisans before the Revolution.

Research).

Whole Earth Review

Sausalito CA

     Stewart Brand introduced the Whole Earth Catalog nearly 25
years ago - it was to be a publication that would serve as a
register and directory for people who were starting
back-to-nature communes.  This published quarterly was a
repository for the information that schools never taught - like
farming and educating children.  Eventually, the magazines gave
way to a series of books.  In 1984, the Whole Earth Software
Catalog was published, and the magazine CoEvolutionary Quarterly
became known as the Whole Earth Review.
     WER is one of the only environmental magazines that is pro-
technology.  It often has articles on virtual reality,
cyberspace, and artificial life.  Plus, it always has reviews of
books, software, and other information technologies.
    WER sponsored Cyberthon and created an internetworked
bulletin board called the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link.
     A four issue subscription to Whole Earth Review is $20.00;
single copies are $6.75.

PO Box 95
Alpena AR

     US Militia is operated by Mr. Kurt Saxon, the remarkable
author of The Poor Man's James Bond series.  These books contain
detailed plans for cheap explosives, homemade guns, and DIY
munitions.  For awhile, Mr.Saxon was convinced that the Russkies
were on the verge of a hostile US takeover, ala Red Dawn.  In one
of his Poor Man's James Bond videos, he concocts a deadly poison
in which you can fill a squirt gun and shoot it at your Russian
captors.  Excellent.
     US Militia is basically a scaled down version of his books.
Useful to any cyberpunk - just in case the mega-corps do take
over!

POB 7951
Ann Arbor MI

     Viral Communications is an independent, non-profit music
label/underground press dedicated to experimental and exploratory
works and sound.
     According to Synergy editor Steev Hise, "the main thrust of
Synergy and VirComm in general is exploring new forms of artistic
expression, especially collaboratory expression, in our modern
technological society.  What happened when the microphone, the
Xerox machine, the tape recorder, the sampler and image scanner,
even the printing press, fell into the hand of creative and free-
thinking artist type people?  And, perhaps, even more
importantly,  what happened and happens in general to people and
society when these kinds of devices were/are used to record what
they do?  How does someone's expression or art change when they
know it is being recorded in some way?"
     VirComm's journal, Synergy, incorporates this viewpoint in
print.  In it are appropriated illustrations and scanned
photographs.  Original poetry, reviews, and essays are also
included.  Entertaining and worthwhile.  Each issue is $2.00.

The FAQ was so popular with net.people that an entire group
sprang up around it.  The FAQ has since grown ten times larger.
Most everyone who is involved in the cyberpunk scene subscribes
to Future Culture - you can't afford not to.
     The list acts as a clearinghouse and accumulator of all
things cyberpunk, fringe, and "New Edge."  Be forewarned, volume
is sometimes very high when there is breaking news on the
cyberpunk front lines.

PGP Source - soda.berkeley.edu
     "Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there
were more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want
privacy must create it for themselves and not expect governments,
corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant
them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people
have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek
to prevent people from speaking about their experiences or their
opinions.
     The most important means to the defense of privacy is
encryption.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.
But to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much
desire for privacy.  Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring
privacy will learn how best to defend it.
     Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.
Cypherpunks wish to learn about it, to teach it, to implement it,
and to make more of it.  Cypherpunks know that cryptographic
protocols make social structures.  Cypherpunks know how to attack
a system and know how to defend it.  Cypherpunks know how hard it
is to make good cryptosystems.
     Cypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public
key cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and
pseudonymous mail forwarding and delivery.  They love to play
with DC - nets.  They love to play with secure communications of
all kinds.
     Cypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write
code to defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, they're
going to write it.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that their
fellow cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Cypherpunks
realize that security is not built in a day and are patient with
incremental progress.
     Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they
write.  Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.
Cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can't be shut
down.     Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy."

     AUtopia is a combination of the words "utopia" and

(like a huge ship), operated by a high-tech, self-governing,
self-sustaining society.  The idea is to somehow acquire an ocean
vessel, get the backing of a small, neutral foreign power, and
declare complete autonomy from any state.  Extensive
communications links, including satellites, telephones,
television (both broadcast and ship-wide), and Internet links
would be fully implemented on AUtopia.   Extensive research in
the fields of virtual reality, nanotechnology, nootropics, and
artificial life would be conducted.  The whole sha-bang would be
fueled by solar panels, wind power, and hydrogen fuel cells.

Below is an interview conducted over the Internet with the
founders of FringeWare, Inc., Paco Xander Nathan and Jon
Lebkowsky:



                  FringeWare, Inc. Interrogated
               -----------------------------------

John:  You started the FringeWare list on the Net awhile back.
How did you come up with the idea?  Were there any collaborators?

PXN:   Yeh, it was in November of 1992.  I'd been working
in government and large megacorps for several years as a
programmer:  IBM, AT&T Baal Labs, Motorola, NASA, etc.  Did some
fun, interesting work, but was getting burned out on the corp
game.  Then I sued Motorola on their drug-testing policy and got
into a major battle, with the US Labor Department on my side.  So
I left to join a biotech start-up in 1990 and that went for
awhile, but I was getting the itch to leave ANY employer.
     Meanwhile, I'd started writing for bOING-bOING, Mondo 2000,
and other "New Edge" magazines - where I'd met Jon Lebkowsky.  He
also had a zine called Unshaved Truths that I started helping
with.  Jon seemed like he was ready to jump outta his government
job, too!
     Writing wasn't going to pay the bills, but my wife and I
(since divorced) had written some software called "Menstat" that
helps women track and estimate fertility cycles, using neural net
models licensed from the biotech firm I was working at.  We tried
to sell our wares but could see it was going to be a hard battle
to break into distribution channels without "selling the farm."
So we picked up rights to sell software from some other
independent developers, and tried to handle some retailing of
our own.
     Jon and I had been reviewing "fringe" items in the zines
- like Beyond Cyberpunk! and IBVA - and we'd seen how a lot of
good titles just didn't fit with mainstream distributors.  So we
said: "Great, pull it all together and sell products from the
fringe!"
     At about the same time, we needed to blast out some info via
e-mail.  Jon and I both work closely with EFF-Austin, helping
plan and publicize events.  Steven Levy was coming to speak at
University of Texas at Austin, and EFF-Austin was going to host a
book signing party at the local New Edge bookstore, Europa Books.
So we organized a mailing list to publicize the "gig" and
afterwards cut a deal to put in a "lease department" in Europa
Books to sell our "fringe wares."  People liked the idea, we
incorporated, passed out flyers at EFF-Austin events, at
HoHo Con (hacker's conference held in Houston) and got the word
out via bOING-bOING, Mondo 2000, and the WELL that we were in
business.  We've been so swamped ever since that we don't
know which part of the fractal is the singularity, if you catch
my drift.  We're trying now to define the company, as well as cut
enough profit to employ ourselves, and it all seems to be
working.  We maintain strong ties with Europa Books and
bOING-bOING and go in together on events.  We've also pulled in
Unshaved Truths under the FWI business.  I think our focus will
stay true to its origins:  non-mainstream products, publications
and promotion.  We do some consulting too, on electronic
publications, games, etc.
     So the e-mail list is a semi-public info service.
It's freely available on the Internet and there's about 300
people on it, but many of the addresses are actually gatewayed
into local newsgroups and BBSes, plus many people use the
file-server without subscribing, so there's probably 500-1000
participating in the FringeWare info service.

JonL:  Paco was marketing his software, Menstat, through
Sudona, and he told me one day that he was going to take on other
software packages to sell.  Wheels turned...we slipped into a
verbal jam that led to the FringeWare concept.  It fit perfectly
into our other gigs...as writers, and as members of the
cyberspace community (or of several cyberspace communities).  The
mailing list was the core of the plan.  We wanted to bring garage
tech and cyber culture crowds together to share ideas and to
perhaps build a community.  And with FringeWare, Inc., we would
provide a market interface for those who were developing wares
but had no idea how to reach the public with them.

John:  Wow!  I had no idea you designed Menstat, Paco!
   It's good to see a list on the Internet that is devoted to
street-tech.  Some of the products FringeWare sells are pretty
obscure, so it's convenient to have a one-stop shopping catalog.
One of my favorite products FWI sells is the Day Dreamer.  Such a
useful tool for a great price!  Do either of you have a favorite
product(s)?

JonL:  My favorite is probably "Beyond Cyberpunk," the
hypercard stack from the Computer Lab.  I reviewed it for Mondo
2000, which means I spent a day before deadline studying it
intensely.  It's a great overview of the pomo/sf scene, and it's
fun to use.  I had to view it on somebody else's Mac; my machine
is a PC.
     We've had a great time with the Innerquest machine,
which uses patterned flashing lights and rhythmic sounds to
enhance meditation.  We've taken it to parties and let folks
sample it...amazing how well it shuts out the cacophony and lets
you zero in...
     Of course, Paco's Menstat is quite a program.  I
reviewed it, too, before we joined forces with FringeWare...but
the review wasn't printed - something about a man reviewing
software specifically for women.  Y' know, gender stuff.  What I
appreciated about it, though, was not so much what it would do
specifically, track menstrual cycle, but the way that it would
allow the user to get that body/machine interaction...a cyborg
effect of sorts.  Not at all in an intrusive way, as in the
cyberpunk meme of body alterations and implants, but as a soft
support for body consciousness.  And it allows you to build your
own medical history for reference, so that a doctor can compare
unusual events to her own biorhythmic cycles; rather than to the
kind of textbook cases they're inclined to use - because that is
usually all they've got.

PXN:   Yep, Day Dreamer and Beyond Cyberpunk! are my
favorites, but I'd have to cite Robert Carr's "Smurfs in Hell"
series as our "most fringeful" vendor - maybe a bit severe for
some (religious) consumers, but definitely has my vote.  Robert
did MacJesus and Mormonoids from the Deep, etc, and is the latest
Mondo 2000 (issue #8).  As for "one-stop shopping," I'd really
like to move in to more DIY supplies, like 6.5 MHz crystals and
X-10 smart home controllers - things people can use to build
weird gizmos.  But so far we've had to start out crawling before
we could walk, learning how to do the fringe retail before we got
into supplies, which are a tougher market.
     By the way, on Menstat - there's been an article
in the latest Whole Earth Review about it but not too favorable.
Susie Bright did a really glowing review for Future Sex, however.
Even so, neither piece mentioned Suzanne Nathan, who really did a
lot of the design, i.e., she was the oman who designed this
software for other women to use, but the women reviewing it
haven't even bothered to talk with her about that yet. I dunno.
Not as many people using the software as there were encouraging
us to develop it!  But maybe that will change with Newton,
wearable computers, etc.

John:  I'll be sure to mention Suzanne Nathan in Technophilia!!
I'm positive that a lot of conceptions about computers will
change as they get smaller.  I can definitely see a not-so-far-
future where it will be just as unusual to see someone with a
wearable computer as seeing someone with a watch or clothes...

JonL:  <left for San Francisco to attend the Third Conference
of Computers, Freedom and Privacy>

PXN:   Yeh, like with portable phones.  I bet concert promoters
will be one of the first groups other than the SS to use 'em!

John:  Yeah, I've also heard that Beyond Cyberpunk! is superb. I
have the demo disk for it, but I had the same problem Jon had - I
don't have a Mac!  I wish the Computer Lab would come out with a
PC version of it.  Is the Smurfs in Hell only for the Mac, too?

PXN:   Yup.  These days I develop for both Mac and Windows.
Apple really pulled a market coup by packaging the MacIntosh
Toolbox in ROM+ 68K instruction traps and by bundling Hypercard.
>From what I understand, both efforts were largely the genius of
Bill Atkinson, over a period of years and several Apple corp
administrations and against all prevailing business acumen.
Bottom line is that programmers had this incredible playground
for building games and muchomedia wares that would run on
anyone's Mac without licensing extra code.  DOS and Windows STILL
don't have that kind of capability without a license.  I worked
with the Computer Lab to help evaluate a DOS port, but it seems
like nothing will compare with what customers expect in terms of
performance/cost after a MacIntosh or Amiga.  Bunch of greedy
bastards in the DOS software biz arena!
     Smurfs in Hell titles are largely based off an
adventure game creation package on the Mac called "World Builder"
that's several years old!  As much as I value the ubiquity of the
Microsoft market, I'd challenge anybody to touch that kinda claim
on "useful, reliable" software.  Asymetrix's Toolbook is the only
thing I've seen that comes close to Hypercard, but it's glacially
slow and their licensing policy obviates most small development
projects - if you wanna stay legal:).     The best route I've
seen lately on DOS is to co-opt those slide-presentation ackages
that have been on DOS systems for about seven years - at least
they combine text, graphics, sequencing, and some hooks for
sound.  We just started carrying a cool piece of erotic online
"literature" called Sexotica by Dragon's Eye productions and I
believe that's the way they are doing low-cost multimedia.  I'll
have to check....

John:  Also, that would be great if you sold those DIY supplies.
Maybe even sell certain "kits" for set prices or something.

PXN:   We've put together an outline for "gift baskets" along
various memes - like a "hack" basket that has a 2600 shirt, some
Jolt cola, and other useful items for social engineering :).
Kinda cheesey          idea, but...

John:  I think that would be pretty funny... As members of the
"cyberculture" community, do you see the recent cyberpunk "boom"
just a fad?

PXN:   Well, lots-o people have been living the meme for years,
so the mainstream-recognition of it will be telling.  Like
in another example, I talked with an English friend of mine about
her background in the rave scene there and now in the US.  The
mainstream recognition of raving in London led to a boom that
drew such huge numbers (and sleazy promoters) that the whole
scene collapsed.  But then it re-emerged as an underground
phenomena again - even more vigorously.
     Cyberpunk is too future-focused to be real/tangible for many
people and seems generally threatening to many.  Like there's a
lot of machismo among the real hacker/cracker crowd and fadish
newcomers wouldn't be supported among them, IMHO.  So the current
boom seems short-lived.  It's just too dark and esoteric to have
a mass appeal.  I mean, you can still stage dive and sport your Doc
Martins after several beers, but it gets tough to be "marginal"
or hack or whatever that way.  Merging your head with a computer
just doesn't translate well to couch potato pursuits, so I don't
see the mass appeal other than through stereotypes and maybe
somebody's idea of clothing.
     Hopefully, the cyberpunk scene will re-emerge from it's fad
as well as raving.
     However, I do think that a lot of the cyber/computer meme
will spread into entertainment, like that's already happening at
mainstream concerts and dance clubs - even other than raves.
That's where the trend will take hold, for my money's worth.  But
people will get used to having the computers being part of the
ambience, and the trend will fade into mechanics.
     On another side, I find it interesting that when I talk with
people who've gone to college, say late twenties or earlier, then
e-mail addresses are almost a given and often preferred over
voice comm.  That's a BIG shift that goes subversively beyond
fads - people want the computer link to reach other people now.
That's my hot button - I hate full duplex...

John:  I sort of equate the interest in cyberpunk today with the
interest of hacking after WarGames.  After that film, the hacker
population grew exponentially.  Luckily, most of the "k00l d00dz"
fell by the wayside to grab the next trend.  But the hacker
community DID benefit from this exposure to the mainstream.  A
lot of hackers were directly or indirectly influenced by that
film, even though they may hate to admit it!
     Plus, cyberpunk is too much centered on change to be a fad.
At the very heart of the cyberpunk movement, there is that
unwillingness to conform to the mainstream, and an inherent
ability to adapt and embrace new reality-maps and new technology.

PXN:   Yeh, the publicity makes for cheaper, more readily
available wall art - good for inspiration :).
     We've tried at bOING-bOING, under the direction of
Mark Frauenfelder and Carla Sinclair, to develop a sense of
"humor cum neophilia." I've called it "Mad Magazine meets
Mad Max."  Somehow, people generally translate that into
"cyberpunk" and we've really tried not to be a strictly
cyberpunk zine.
     Maybe as fads ebb and flow, people will get more comfortable
with terms that dance around the cyborg and "homo mutatis" themes
and then develop "finer granularity" in the common
language/concept.
     The absolute most important subset of the "cyberpunk" genre,
IMHO, are the Cypherpunks - the crypto-anarchy movement coming
out of Berkeley.  It's weird, starting small, but heady and
potentially mushrooming like a recycle of the Berkeley Free
Speech Movement three decades ago.  Much of the first issue of
FringeWare Review is dedicated to a tutorial on the basis for
cypherpunks and how that enables the fringe marketplace/community
in a global village. Ie. "pop encryption," Internet remailers,
digital cash banks (already online!) - those are quickly forming
the new Underground - and light years beyond the auto-dialers and
blue boxes of WarGames!  And it's great, they're also light years
ahead in terms of "positive" social impact,ee.g., liberalizing
privacy.

John:  Yeah, the cypherpunk movement is also very active in
Britain...
     I agree with you that the cypherpunk movement is truly a
huge step forward in social-technology evolution.  It's
definitely hard on the governments, since the encryption
techniques are so advanced that can't be broken even by the NSA.
It gives the underground community true autonomy.  Digital online
banking futhers this autonomy by decentralizing the money system.
Unfortunately, corporate take-overs of this technology are
probably inevitable - most likely 5-10 years.
     Do you see the commercialization of the Internet as
inescapable?  If so, do you see the companies being progressive,
like FringeWare, or do you see the same companies that rule the
"real" world trying to stake their claim on the information
networks?

PXN:   I think the issue is Multiplicity.  Whereas currently in
business, much of the confluence gets channeled through some
rather strict gatekeepers - if I want to do biz, then I need a
DBA or incorporation, a commercial bank account, mucho tax form,
etc.  The banks, credit bureaus, tax agencies, etc., are watching
and recording every step, and I'm liable for criminal charges if
there's any intentional attempt to keep my biz private.  Other
people and agencies determine my business identity.  Some of
them, like banks, are greedy bastards to which I'd rather not
have to fuck with at all.  That's why so many small businesses
run on a cash basis,  because otherwise they end up paying $50.00
a month for "commercial bank services," ie., that don't pay
interest, $100.00 a month CPA charges, $1000.00 a month
commercial office rent so that the bank believes you aren't a
fraud/scam, and all kinds of extras to the point that you'd be
better off either working for a big corp and/or dealing
contraband.
     A central tenet of the cyberpunk aims is that Identity is
defined by what you know.  A private key defines
an identity.  I can have many private identities and transact
with people who also have multiple identities.
     There's just really no way possible for a
"corporate takeover" to restrict my access to my own identity
(ies).  And as for the banking, that's already online and as long
as some kind of market forces lure fringe characters into
commerce, I don't see how the centralization meme can interfere,
practically.  Not until a whole new branch of mathematics gets
devised to defeat populist encryption, and even then the
"numbers" (traffic volume) would likely defeat any "central
authority."
     I'm not saying that's utopia.  Resources are scarce.
Humans are wired to fight for scarce resources.  I see physical
world violence ahead over more and more of the natural resources.
     But John Q. Banker won't have a whole lot of say over my
livelihood just because I didn't wear a suit to meet with him
about my commercial account, because digital banking will become
public domain software - that's what people don't understand yet.
Computer systems integrators (like IBM) didn't understand why
public domain/low cost spreadsheet software spelled their doom,
until several years after the fact.   That's where cypherpunks
are perched right now.
     As for the commercialization of the Internet - well, I think
NSFNet stinks. Any large operation like that will look good in
terms of performance, but smaller, more competitive ventures
would be better in the long run.  I'm grateful that theU.S.
Government was interested to experiment with Internet, but I
don't want it to continue funding and continue dictating
appropriate use, even though most lawyers in the field think the
AUP isn't tight enough to hold in court.  I guess I am just a
hard-line economic conservative when it comes down to it....
     Eastern Europe and much of the Third World have now
"internetworked" via REALLY low end protocols - primarily
FidoNet. Because that's all the US would allow to be imported!!
So now they have a digital infrastructure that doesn't require
massive federal expenditure and can be/is as commercial as
anybody there pleases.  I view Internet as a "bodiless" version
of the international phone system.  I don't care if it's
commercial or not, just that I can make a call at a reasonable
rate.  That's how many people are implementing the Internet.
I'm reaching you via a commercial Internet site that costs users
five dollars a month.  Better than cable TV :)!  Sure, it's very
commercial in the sense that AT&T and the federal government make
MUCHO more calls than I ever do,  but that doesn't stop me from
making my living through the phone.
Didn't stop Steve Jackson from winning a lawsuit against the
federal government on Friday (March 12, 1993) either.  I think
the best example is how a relatively small group of activists
used the phone system in China during Tienneman Square to subvert
their "local crack down" via phone/fax/e-mail.              I
Also enjoy (as a former IBM employee) the manner in which almost
every US-based CEO has earnestly turned down the option to run
IBM!!  That's an argument for multiplicity if I've ever seen one.
     It still takes major capital to focus long-term effort, so I
don't see or want large firms to vanish. But they'll have to be
relatively adaptive large firms (like Apple or Microsoft) that
care more about boosting their own viability (ie, cutting losses,
mutating as needed, saving their own skins via brain over brawn)
than about maintaining status quo (like the silly firms that who
forced us into Vietnam).
     I think a lot of firms on the Net will be smaller and even
more progressive, too - like FringeWare.  Or maybe other examples
like AMiX, bOING- bOING, or even UPI for a medium-sized example.
I think Tierra software <artificial life software available for
free on the Net - John> would be a good analogy for the flux of
organism size as new constants and possibilities are introduced
into a "soup."
     To sum, the "corporate takeover" is pretty much on the way
out so long as the cypherpunk agenda pursues its goals.
Corporations (and I own the half of one) are just "identities"
which the government preserves.  The corps pay major kickbacks,
i.e., "return on investment," to the government to help maintain
their physical identity.  Governments are based on violence, if
necessary, to preserve their order.  Corps endorse governments to
use force when needed and underwrite official violent operations,
for the sake of self-preservation.  It's a pretty high-end means
of preserving identity, in the physical world, which is what
corps were created for.
     Now, we can create identity in cyberspace, capable of
transacting commerce like corps in the physical space, but not
requiring all those goddamn bullets and suits to defend it.
Read: lower overhead to sustain life, ergo trendline moves to
smaller total system size.  IMHO, the grand US/British experiment
in government has been to spawn virtual lifeforms, i.e.,
corporations.  Now we see potential for more efficient virtual
lifeforms to grow in significance.  Like when the proto-rodents
scurried underfoot to avoid the death knell of starving
dinosaurs, perhaps.
         Seriously, Tyrannosaurus Rex could tear the flesh, but
not the genome, outta those proto-rodents :).  That's how I view
the inevitable commercialization of the Internet.  There won't be
many monster lizards left to terrorize, but quite a few Sabre
Tooths and Wooly Mammoths, nonetheless!

Extropian Institute
PO Box 57306
Los Angeles CA
90057-0306
          The Extropy Institute are for those who want a better
future through technology and personal advancement.  Extropians
are reality-based, not some starry-eyed, "flying jet car"
futurists.  Their philosophy goes beyond humanism to the
transhuman and even the posthuman level.
     Reproduced here are the Extropian Principles written by the
director of ExI, Max More:
     The Extropian Principles V.2.0

1.  Boundless Expansion - Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and
personal power, an unlimited lifespan, and removal of natural,
social, biological, and psychological limits to
self-actualization and self - realization.  Overcoming limits on
our personal and social progress and possibilities.  Expansion
into the universe and infinite existence.
     Beginning as mindless matter, parts of nature developed in a
slow evolutionary advance which produced progressively more
powerful brains.  Chemical reactions generated tropistic
behavior, which was superseded by instinctual and Skinnerian
stimulus- response behavior, and then by conscious learning and
experimentation.  With the advent of the conceptual consciousness
of humankind, the rate of advancement sharply accelerated as
intelligence, technology, and the scientific method could be
applied to our condition.  Extropians seek the continuation and
fostering of this process, transcending biological and
psychological limits as we proceed into posthumanity.
     In aspiring to transhumanity, and beyond to posthumanity,
we reject natural and traditional limitations on our
possibilities.  We champion the rational use of science and
technology to void limits on lifespan, intelligence, personal
power, freedom, and experience.  We are immortalists because we
recognize the absurdity of accepting "natural" limits to our
lives.  For many the future will bring an exodus from Earth - the
womb of human and transhuman intelligence - expanding the
frontiers of humanity (and posthumanity) to include space
habitats, other planets and this solar system, neighboring
systems, and beyond.  By the end of the 21st century, more people
may be living off-planet than on Earth.
     Resource limits are not immutable.  The market price system
encourages conservation, substitution and innovation, preventing
any need for a brake on growth and progress.  Expansion into
space will vastly expand the energy and resources for our
civilization.  Living extended transhuman lifespans will foster
intelligent use of resources and environment.  Extropians affirm
a rational, market- mediated environmentalism aimed at
maintaining and enhancing our biospheres (whether terrestrial or
extra-terrestrial).  We oppose apocalyptic environmentalism,
which hallucinates catastrophes, issues a stream of doomsday
predictions, and attempts to strangle our continued evolution.
     No mysteries are sacrosanct, no limits unquestionable; the
unknown must yield to the intelligent mind.  We seek to
understand and to master reality up to and beyond any currently
foreseen limits.
2.  Self Transformation - A commitmant to continual moral,
intellectual, and physical self-improvement, using reason and
critical thinking, personal responsibility, and experimentation.
Biological and neurological augmentation.
     We affirm reason, critical inquiry, intellectual
independence, and intellectual honesty.  We reject blind faith
and passive, comfortable thinking that leads to dogmatism,
religion, and conformity.  A commitment to positive
self-transformation requires us to critically analyze our current
beliefs, behaviors, and strategies.  Extropians therefore choose
to place their self-value in continued development rather than
"being right."  We prefer analytical thought to fuzzy but
comfortable delusion, empiricism to mysticism, and independent
evaluation to conformity.  Extropians affirm a philosophy of life
but distance themselves from religious thinking because of its
blind faith, debasement of human dignity, and systemized
irrationality.
     Perpetual self-improvement - physical, intellectual,
psychological, and ethical - requires us to continually
re-examine our lives.  Extropians seek to etter themselves, yet
without denying their current worth.  The desire to improve
should not be confused with the belief that one is lacking in
current value.  But valuing oneself in the present cannot mean
self-satisfaction, since an intelligent and probing mind can
always envisage a superior self in the future.  Extropians are
committed to expanding wisdom, fine- tuning understanding of
rational behavior, and enhancing physical and intellectual
capacities.
     Extropians are commitment and experimentalists.  We are
commitment because we track the latest research for more
efficient means of achieving our goals.  We are experimentalists
because we are willing to explore and test the novel means of
self- transformation that we uncover.  In our quest for
advancement to the transhuman stage, we rely on our own
judgement, seek our own path, and reject both blind conformity
and mindless rebellion.  Extropians frequently diverge from the
mainstream because they do not allow themselves to be chained by
dogmas, whether religious, political, or social.  Extropians
choose their values and behavior reflectively, standing firm when
required but responding flexibly to novel conditions.
     Personal responsibility and self-determination goes hand-in-
hand with neophilic self-experimentation.  Extropians take
responsibility for the consequences of our choices, refusing to
blame others for the risks involved in our free choices.
Experimentation and self-transformation require risks; Extropians
wish to be free to evaluate the risks and potential benefits for
ourselves, applying our own judgement and wisdom, and assuming
responsibility for the outcome.  We neither wish others to force
standards upon us through legal regulation, nor do we wish others
to follow our path.  Personal-responsibility and
self-determination are incompatible with authoritarian
centralized control, which stifles the free choices and
spontaneous ordering of autonomous persons.
     External coercion, whether for the purported "good for the
whole" or the paternalistic protection of the individual, is
unacceptable to us.  Compulsion breeds ignorance and weakens the
connection between personal choice and personal outcome, thereby
destroying personal responsibility.  The proliferation of
outrageous liability lawsuits, governmental safety regulations,
and the rights-destroying drug war result from ignoring these
facts of life.  Extropians are rational individualists, living by
their own judgement, making critical, informed, and free choices
and accepting responsibility for those choices.
     As commitment, Extropians study advanced, emerging, and
future technologies for their self-transformative potential in
enhancing our abilities and freedom.  We support biomedical
research with the goal of understanding and controlling the aging
process.  We are interested in any plausible means of conquering
death, including interim measures like biostasis/cryonics, and
long-term possibilities such as migration out of biological
bodies into superior vehicles ("uploading").
     We practice and plan for biological and neurological
augmentation through means such as effective cognitive enhancers
or "smart drugs," computers and electronic networks, General
Semantics and other guides to effective thinking, meditation and
visualization techniques, accelerated learning strategies, and
applied cognitive psychology, and soon neural - computer
integration.  We do not accept the limits imposed on us by our
natural heritage, instead we apply the evolutionary gift of our
rational, empirical intelligence in order to surpass human limits
and enter the transhuman and posthuman stages of the future.
3.  Intelligent Technology - Applying science and technology to
transcend "natural" limits imposed by our biological heritage and
environment.
     Extropians do not denigrate technology, no matter how
radically different from historical norms, as "unnatural." The
term 'natural' is largely devoid of meaning.  We might say that
any technological means of altering the environment or the human
body is unnatural since it changes the previously existing state
of nature.  But we can also say that applying our intelligence
through technology is natural to humans, and so changing both
outside nature and our own biological nature can be regarded as
natural.
     Extropians affirm the necessity and desirability of science
and technology.  Practical means should be used to promote our
goals of immortality, expanding intelligence, and greater
physical abilities, rather than the wishful thinking, ignorant
mysticism, and credulity, so common to the New Agers.  Science
and technology, as disciplined forms of intelligence, should be
fostered, and we should seek to employ them in eradicating the
limits to our Extropian visions.
     We do not share common cultural fears of technology, such as
those embodied in the story of Frankenstein and the myth of the
Tower of Babel.  We favor careful and cautious development of
powerful technologies, but refuse to stifle development on the
basis of fear of the unknown.  Extropians therefore oppose the
anti-human "Back to the Pleistocene", anti-civilization rhetoric
of the extreme environmentalists.  Going backwards means death
for billions and stagnation and oppression for the rest.
Intelligent use of biotechnology, nanotechnology, space and other
technologies, in conjunction with the market system, can remove
resource constraints and discharge environmental pressures.
     We see technological development not as in end in itself,
but as a means to the achievement and development of our values,
ideals, and visions.  We seek to employ science and technology to
remove limits to growth, and to radically transform both the
internal and external conditions of existence.
     We see the coming years and decades as being a time of
enormous changes, changes which will vastly expand our
opportunities, our freedom, and our abilities.  Genetic
engineering, interventive gerontology (life extension), space
migration, smart drugs, more powerful computers and smarter
programming, neural-computer interfaces, virtual reality, swift
electronic communications, artificial intelligence, neural
networks, artificial life, neuroscience, and nanotechnology will
contribute to accelerating change.
4.  Spontaneous Order -  Promotion of decentralized,
voluntaristic social coordination mechanisms.  Fostering of
tolerance, diversity, long-term planning, individual incentives
and personal liberties.
     Spontaneous orders are self-generating, organic orders and
differ from constructed, centrally directed orders.  Both types
of order have their place, but spontaneous orders are vital in
our social interactions.  Spontaneous orders have properties that
make them especially conducive to Extropian goals and values and
spontaneous ordering processes can be found at work in many
fields.  The evolution of complex biological forms is one
example;  others include the adjustment of ecosystems, artificial
life demonstrations, memetics (the study of replicating
information patterns), computational markets (agoric open
systems), brain function and neurocomputation.
     The principle of spontaneous order is embodied in the free
market system - a system that does not yet exist in pure form.
The free market allows complex institutions to develop, encourage
innovation, rewards individual initiative and reinforces personal
responsibility, fosters diversity, and safeguards political
freedom.  Market economies ensure the technological and social
progress essential to the Extropian philosophy.  We reject the
technocratic idea of central control by self-proclaimed experts.
No group of experts can understand and control the endless
complexity of an economy and society.  Expert knowledge is best
harnessed and transmitted through the superbly efficient
mediation of the free market's price signals - signals that
embody more information than any person or group could ever
gather.
     Sustained progress and intelligent, rational decision-making
requires the diverse sources of information and differing
perspectives made possible by spontaneous orders.  Central
direction constrains exploration, diversity, freedom, and
dissenting opinion.  Respecting spontaneous order means
supporting voluntaristic, autonomy maximizing institutions as
opposed to rigidly hierarchical, authoritarian groupings with
their bureaucratic structure, suppression of innovation and
diversity, and smothering of individual incentives.
Understanding spontaneous orders makes us highly suspicious of
"authorities" where these are imposed on us, and skeptical of
coercive leaders, unquestioning obedience, and unexamined
traditions.
     Making effective use of a spontaneously ordering social
system requires us to be tolerant and peaceful, allowing others
to pursue their lives as they see fit, just as we expect to be
left to follow our own paths.  We can best achieve mutual
progress by interacting cooperatively and benevolently toward all
who do not threaten our lives, and by supporting diversity of
opinion and behavior.  Extropians are guided in their actions by
studying the fields of strategy, decision theory and game theory.
These make clear to us the benefits of cooperation and encourage
the long-term thinking appropriate to persons seeking an
unlimited lifespan.

5.  Dynamic Optimism - Positive expectations to fuel dynamic
action.  Promotion of a positive, empowering attitude towards our
individual future and that of all intelligent beings.  Rejection
both of blind faith and stagnant pessimism.
     We espouse a positive, dynamic, empowering attitude.  To
successfully pursue our values and live our lives we must reject
gloom, defeatism, and the common cultural focus on negatives.
Problems - technical, social, psychological, ecological - should
be acknowledged but not allowed to dominate our thinking and our
direction.  We respond to gloom and nay-saying by exploration and
promotion of new possibilities.  Extropians hold to both short
and long-term optimism:  In the short term we can cultivate our
lives and enhance ourselves;  in the long term the positive
potentials for intelligent beings are virtually limitless.
     We question limits that others take for granted,  We look at
the acceleration in scientific and technical knowledge, ascending
standards of living, and social and moral evolution and project
further advances.  More researchers today than all past history
strive to understand aging, control disease, upgrade computers,
and develop biotechnology and nanotechnology.  Technological and
social evolution continue to accelerate, leading, some of us
expect, to a Singularity - a future time when many of the rules
of life will so radically diverge from those familiar to us, and
progress will be so rapid, that we cannot now comprehend that
time.  Extropians will maintain the acceleration of progress and
encourage it in beneficial directions.
     Adopting dynamic optimism means focusing on possibilities
and opportunities, and being alert to solutions and
potentialities.  And it means refusing to whine about what cannot
be avoided, learning from mistakes rather than dwelling on them
in a victimizing, punishing manner.  Dynamic optimism requires us
to take the initiative, to jump up and to plough into our
difficulties with an attitude that says we can achieve our goals,
rather than to sit back and immerse ourselves in defeatist
thinking.
     Dynamic optimism is not compatible with passive faith.
Faith in a better future is confidence that an external force,
whether God, State, or society, will solve our problems.  Faith,
or the Polyanna/Dr.Pangloss variety of optimism, breeds passivity
by encouraging the belief that progress will be affected by
others.  Faith requires a determined belief in external forces
and so encourages dogmatism and irrational rigidity of belief and
behavior.  Dynamic optimism fosters activity and intelligence,
telling us that we are capable of improving life through our own
efforts.  Oppotunities and possibilities are everywhere, waiting
for us to seize them and create new ones.  To achieve our goals,
we must believe in ourselves, work hard, and be open to revise
our strategies.
     Where others see difficulties, we see challenges.  Where
others give up, we move forward.  Where others say enough is
enough, we say: Forward! Upward! Outward!  We espouse personal,
social, and technological evolution in ever higher forms.
Extropians see too far and change too rapidly to feel future
shock.  Let us advance the way of evolutionary progress.

                            Brain Machines
                         --------------------

Sound and Light
---------------
     Flickering light has long been known to cause alterations in
consciousness and induce trances.  Older generations knew this:
even primitive humans gazed into fires and some early physicists
in classical times experimented with flickering sunlight.
     Sound, too, has often been thought of to hold "magical"
powers.  Primitive religions and the ancient mystery cults of the
Hellenistic period both used rhythmic drum beating to induce
states of consciousness.
     In this age, electronically produced sound and flickering
LED lights take the place of fire and drum beats.
     Right before World War II, a startling discovery was made in
the field of neuroscience.  Scientists discovered that the
electrical activity of the brain would take on the same rhythm of
a flashing light.  This process of assimilation became known as
entrainment.  Later studies found that certain flicker
frequencies  produced surprising beneficial effects, including
increased standardized test scores, enhances memory, and greater
communication between the two hemispheres of the brain.  The
addition of synthesized beat sounds were later added to enhance
the overall effects.

     Brainwave Patterns
     Beta (13+ Hz) - the alert stage we are all familiar with -
the "fight or flight" feeling.  Higher beta frequencies increases
headaches, and over the long term increases risks for heart
attacks.
     Alpha (8-12 Hz) - still fully alert, but much more relaxed.
     Theta  (4-7 Hz) - the dreamy state right before sleep; in
theta stage subjects become more receptable to learning.
     Delta (1-3 Hz) - sleep.
     Light and sound machines usually consist of opaque glasses
with built in flashing lights and a pair of headphones with
synthesized synchronized beeping sounds.


Ganzfeld
--------
     Basically, "ganzfeld" is a mind deprivation device that
eliminates any ocular stimulation.
     The mind, as it turns out, works best when the eyes are
presented with blank but brightly lit and unwavering field of
color.


Sensory Deprivation Tanks
-------------------------
     A saline-solution filled coffin-like chamber, in which
someone lies in complete darkness.  This is supposed to eliminate
all external sights and sounds and create a womb-like
environment.

     The mind machine industry is still by and large a do it
yourself - hobbyists are experimenting with their brains.  And
unlike meditation, which requires hours of quiet and years of
training, brain machines do the work for you!
     Is this stuff safe?  What do our benevolent government
agencies have to say about these devices?  Well, they are
completely safe.  No danger can come from using any of the brain
machines listed in this book, unless you are an epileptic and
could have seizures from the flickering light.  And as of yet,
the FDA has no ruling on brain machines, except for a few that
produce electrical charges.  But if you are interested, buy them
soon - you never know when the FDA Gestapo will storm in and take
them away.



                          Mind Machines
                       -------------------

Day Dreamer (It's like tripping without the drugs! - Kelly Green,
inventor and distributor)
     The Day Dreamer, alternately known as the KaleidoSky and the
LSD Flight simulator, is the ultimate low-end brain toy.
     The brainchild of Colorado developer Kelly Green, the Day
Dreamer is a purple plastic SCUBA-like mask that fits over the
eyes and nose.  The wearer looks at the sun and blows into a
little hole located at the bottom of the mask, which causes an
inner disk to rotate. This rotation generates, according to the
pamphlet, "a flickering effect of the sun's full color spectrum
on your closed eyelids."  The result is a fascinating pattern
panorama of colors, shapes, and patterns.  This same effect is
probably what Archimedes and his friends saw when they spun a
wheel around and looked at the sun through closed eyes and
induced trances and hypnosis.
     Since the Day Dreamer uses direct sunlight, it is the only
brain machine/toy that uses a true FULL spectrum.
     Timothy Leary says, "The KaleidoSky is a wonderful binocular
window into the Neuroverse."
     At only 14.95 a unit, the Day Dreamer is one of the best
bargains in this book.  It can be ordered from FringeWare or
direct from Alpha Odysseys (PO Box 17997, Boulder CO 80308).


Mastermind DLS
--------------
     One of the most sophisticated, flexible, and affordable mind
machines on the market.  The Mastermind DLS is the first light
and sound machine that provides easy upgrading via software
modules.
     Features of the DLS include 50 programs in five modes
(sleep, relax, energy, learn, creativity/visualization), four
different synthesized sounds, and manual control of light
brightness and sound volume.  Plus you can play audio tapes and
let the music drive the visual display.
     Specially encoded cassettes and CDs that come with expansion
modules can be uploaded to the Mastermind DLS and stored in non-
volatile memory, which means you would never really have to buy
another mind machine again.
     The Mastermind DLS is $295.95 and can be ordered from Tools
for Exploration.


Synergizer
----------
     Synetic Systems' Synergizer turns the IBM PC into a
professional level brain machine.  GUI interface can create
sessions of any desired length and complexity.
     Features include independent control of each ear and eye,
pulse rate, shift rate via a timed "ramp," different sounds can
sweep left and right, and has a multi-voiced sound synthesizer,
and waveforms can be manipulated on-screen.  Sessions can be
saved on disk.
     The Synergizer's software is upgradeable, and future
releases will include a Mastermind DLS programming interface.
     Synergizer comes with circuit board, software, glasses and
headphones.  Requires DOS 3.1+, 640K, hard disk, and mouse.
     The Synergizer costs $595.00 and can be purchased from Tools
for Exploration or Synetic Systems.


Alpha Stim CS
-------------
     The Alpha Stim CS has the distinction of being the only FDA-
approved brain machine.  Its used by health professionals and
sports trainers to alleviate severe, chronic pain.  The Alpha
Stim CS sends electrical pulses to the desired area and the body
responds to the signals with a deluge of endorphins to relieve
the pain.
     Alpha Stim CS also has a "transcranial electrostimulation"
mode.  The electrodes are attached to the temples and the
electrical charges are sent directly to the brain, which produces
an "electronarcosis."  This brings the user into a state of deep
relaxation and heightened awareness.
     Unfortunately, the Alpha Stim CS is only available to
licensed medical professionals or by prescription.
     Cost $750.  The company that used to produce the Alpha Stim
CS has recently merged with Tools for Exploration, so contact
them for the latest information.
Nustar II
     Instead of lights and sound used to entrain the brain, the
Nustar II uses electrical pulses via electrodes attached to the
brain.  Sound scary?  Don't worry, all the levels of intensity
are way below the limits set up by the FDA.
     The console includes controls for adjusting frequency and
intensity.  Comes with a four electrode band with a velcro
closure.
     Cost $399.


Mind Mirror
-----------
     Called a "thought processing appliance" by its creator
Timothy Leary, Mind Mirror helps the user reprogram his or her
mind, which has been previously conditioned by genetic chance and
external stimuli.
     Mind Mirror interacts with the brain in four areas:
emotions, mental ability, social interaction, and bioenergy.
Subprograms of Mind Mirror, disguised as games, deal with career,
education, and love/home life.
     $19.95 from Fringeware.


Calmpute
--------
     Calmpute is a combination software/biofeedback machine.
Since the user is in direct contact with the computer, there is a
literal mind-computer interface.
     Calmpute consists of a mouse-like device that attaches into
the serial port on the back of the computer.  This device has
finger slots made of galvanic skin response material instead of
regular mouse buttons.  The mouse send the stress response to the
computer which runs a variety of programs, including word
association games, physical stress tests.  There is even a racing
game called Calmprix, in which your car goes faster the more
relaxed you are - supposedly this teaches how to work well under
pressure.


Mindgear PR2
------------
     Standard  light and sound machine fare - binaural beats,
synchronized with light, independent frequencies for right and
left eyes.  Twenty five preset programs and enough ROM available
for up to ten personal programs.
     Comes with control unit, headphones, and red light goggles.
     $349.00 from Tools for Exploration.
The Shaman
     The least expensive but still adequate mind machine.
     Features include flashing lights synchronized with binaural
beats, frequencies range from 1-20 Hz, programmable "ramp time",
light intensity, and beat volume.
     $195.00 from Tools for Exploration.


Stress Shield
-------------
      The Stress Shield is a visor that shuts out outside light
completely, while the battery powered Shield produces a red,
green, or yellow "void."  By producing this undifferentiated
visual field, the wearer becomes more introspective and calms
down.
     The Stress Shield is the most economical and effective
ganzfeld device on the market.
     $149 from Tools for Exploration.


IBVA
Psychic Labs, Inc.
280 Park Ave South, Suite 7G
New York NY
10010
     The IBVA is one of the strangest, most powerful, and most
fascinating brain machines listed here.
     Basically, the IBVA (Interactive Brainwave Visual Analyzer)
is a combination electroencephalograph (EEG) and biofeedback
machine.  The user straps on a headband and the brainwave data is
transmitted to a Macintosh.  The IBVA software reads these digtal
signals and displays the information in either a 3D graph or a
standard EEG display, both in real time.  This allows for
instantaneous recognition of brainwave transitions and activity.
Brainwave data can be saved on disk, or exported to any
electronically addressable device (including CD and laser disc
players), or even be transmitted over networks or modems.
      The best function of the IBVA is that the brainwave
activity can be applied to other functions and software, such as
controlling graphics, sounds, QuickTime animations, MIDI devices
(you can play music with your brain!).  The applications of this
device are virtually unlimited.
     IBVA Developer System costs $995.
     LR IBVA Developer System (which allows for simultaneous
right and left halves of the brain, or two persons) costs $1995.
     You'll need a Mac running at least System 6.07 with 8 megs
main memory, and an Apple MIDI Manager.
     Quicktime animations that can be controlled by IBVA are
available from:

                          Smart Drugs
                       -----------------

     "Smart Drugs" are drugs that have been found to have
beneficial mind enhancing effects, such as delaying aging,
enhancing brain metabolism, improving memory, concentration, and
problem solving techniques.  Smart drugs are also called
nootropics (Greek: mind acting).  You will notice that many of
these drugs were created and tested for people with nerve
degenerative diseases, but they have been found to work for
anyone.
     Smart drugs are very popular among ravers and technophiles:
these are the drugs that are necessary yo keep up with today's
information society.
     Many smart drugs have a "bell-curve" dose response, that is
- if you take too much of a drug, the opposite (bad memory,
confusion) will happen.  Smart drugs, for the most part, are
virtually toxic free.
     Smart drugs became popular after a loophole in the 1988 FDA
policy (intended for AIDS drugs), which allowed for non-FDA
approved drugs to be imported to the US for a limited time.  As a
result, drug export houses grew and the smart drug industry was
born.  Recently, the FDA has clamped down with import alerts,
claiming they were trying to stamp out the "snake-oil salesmen."
Many import houses were forced to shut down or close up shop.  No
doubt the FDA will also try to clamp down on the dietary
supplements and vitamins industry.  So proceed with smart drugs
at your own risk.
NOTE: Do not use this book as medical advice.  The following is
presented for informational purposes only.  Consult your doctor
before you try ANY of the below substances.
NOTE: All dosage information has been removed from the original
manuscript!  I do not feel like getting sued just because some
idiot tries some of these or mixes them with other medications.



                 Smart Drugs and Mind Nutrients
              ------------------------------------
Vitacel 3-7
     Benefits - Also known as Gerovital or GH-3/7, Vitacel 3-7 is
a mixture of procaine, benzoic acid, and potassium metabisulfate
(a powerful antioxidant).  Vitacel has been tested to increase
energy, memory, and treat depression.
     Warnings - no known side effects.


Gingko Biloba
     The gingko biloba is the oldest species of tree known, and
it's leaves have been used by the Chinese as medicine for
thousands of years.
     Benefits - has been shown to improve cerebral circulation,
an attentive, alert mind, and increases the body's production of
adenosine triphosphate (an energy molecule).  Ginkgo also
enhances the ability to metabolize glucose. Gingko has been shown
to act as an anti-oxidant.
     Warnings and Side Effects - Ginkgo Biloba is safe, even in
high quantities.


DMAE (Dimethylaminoethyl)
     Benefits - DMAE increases physical energy, the ability to
learn and remember, expands the life span of laboratory rats, and
accelerates the synthesis of acetylcholine.  DMAE produces a
placid, moderate stimulant effect.  Unlike coffee of
amphetimines, this high won't cause insomnia or a quick letdown.
Luckily, DMEA is regarded as a nutrition supplement, and can be
easily purchased in the United States.
     Warnings - Overdose may cause insomnia and tenseness of
muscles.  Manic depressives should steer clear of DMAE - it may
augment depression.


Choline
     Benefits - Choline is changed into acetylcholine when inside
the body.  Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used in memory
functions, and studies have shown that taking choline improves
memory for some.
     Choline can be purchased in many health food stores, plus in
a number of the catalogs below.  Three forms of choline are
common - choline chloride, choline bitartrate, and phosphatidyl
choline.  The best type to buy is phosphatidyl choline.  PC
repairs and maintains nerve and brain cells, aids in the
metabolism of fat, and helps regulate cholesterol levels in the
blood.
     Warnings - Manic depressives should avoid taking choline
supplements.  Choline bitartrate and choline chloride can cause
diarrhea.


Acetyl L-Carnitine
     Benefits - Effects are similar to choline compounds, due to
similar molecular structure.  Acetyl L-Carnitine also inhibits
the formation of lipofuscin (fatty deposits which are related to
decreased mental faculties in the elderly).  Acetyl L-Carnitine
has been tested to increase alertness and attention span in
Alzheimer patients.
     Warnings - No studies have discovered any side effects.


Centrophenoxine
     Benefits - Centrophenoxine removes lipofuscin deposits and
repairs damaged synapses in the brian.  Lipofuscin deposits are
associated with aging and decreasing mental abilities.
Centrophenoxine has also been shown to be an effective memory
booster.  Once in the body, centrophenoxine breaks down into DMAE
and acts as a free radical scavenger.

     Warnings - Should not be used by people who have very high
blood pressure or are excitable.  Side effects to centrophenoxine
are scarce, but include insomnia, hyperexcitability, and
depression.  To allay these affects, lower dosages are
recommended.


Deprenyl
     Benefits - Deprenyl was originally developed for treating
Parkinson's disease, but has been found to aid in fighting other
problems, too.  Deprenyl increases the brain's level of dopamie,
a neurotransmitter that cause heightened emotional states,
aggression, and raises one's libido.  For these reasons, some
treat Deprenyl as an aphrodisiac.
     Warnings - can cause nausea in higher doses and death if
taken with amphetamines.


Hydergine
     Benefits - Hydergine is a type of ergot, a common rye
fungus.  When hydergine was being tested for other purposes in
the late 1940's, many elderly subjects were reporting increased
mental functions. Nowadays, hydergine is a very popular and
inexpensive treatment for senility.  It is the first drug to show
strength against Alzheimer's disease.
     Hydregine prevents damage to brain cells from insufficient
oxygen, increases brain cell metabolism, and causes dendrites
(branches of a nerve cell that receive information).  Hydergine
even appears to repair damage to brain cells.
     Note - hydergine effectively synergizes with piracetam.  If
you plan on taking the two together, scale the dosage down on
each.
     Warnings - large doses may cause nausea or headaches.
Strangely enough, an overdose of hydergine may cause amnesiac
effects.  If this should occur, just 1 '% ' osage.

Piracetam
     Piracetam started the new pharmaceutical category of
nootropics (Gr. "acting on the mind").  Piracetam is similar in
composition to the amino acid pyroglutamate.
     Benefits - Piracetam has been shown to enhance learning and
memory.  Piracetam promotes the flow of information between
hemispheres of the brain.   When these two side "talk" to each
other, flashes of creativity (the eureka effect) often occur.
     Piracetam uses up large amounts of acetylcholine, so a
choline supplement will probably help in maximizing the effects.
     Piracetam synergizes well with DMAE, centrophenoxine, and
hydergine.
     Warnings - Negative effects are very uncommon, but can
include insomnia, nausea, and headaches.  The toxicity level of
piracetam is unknown.


Oxiracetam
     Benefits - Oxiracetam is an analog of piracetam.
Oxiracetam's potency is greater than piracetam and is more
effective in memory improvement, concentration and stimulating
alertness.
     Warnings - Like piracetam, oxiracetam is very safe at all
dosage levels.


DHEA
     Benefits - Dehydroepiandrosterone is the most abundant
steroid found in the body, and aids in fighting obesity, aging,
and cancer.
     Studies have linked low DHEA levels in the body with nerve
degeneration.  Furthermore, DHEA guards brain cells from
Alzheimer's and other degenerative diseases.
     Warnings - not much research identifies the side effects of
long term use of DHEA.


Fipexide
     Benefits - Fipexide improves short term memory and attention
span.  In addition to its cognitive enhancing effects, fipexide
enhances the effects of dopamine (the neurotransmitter
responsible for motivation and emotions), which can help lessen
depression.
     Warnings - No known side effects in recent medical
literature.


Vasopressin
     Vasopressin is a hormone released by the pituitary gland and
is used for imprinting new material into memory.
     Benefits - Vasopressin improves memory retention and recall,
concentration, and attention.
     Certain drugs, such as LSD and cocaine, deplete the body's
natural supply of vasopressin, so inhaling a spray of vasopressin
can replenish the body.  Also, since the release of vasopressin
is impeded by alcohol and marijuana, a dose of bottled
vasopressin will compensate.
     Warnings - Can produce the following side effects: runny or
itching nose, abdominal cramps, increased bowel movements.
Shouldn't be used by people with high blood pressure.
NOTE:  Vasopressin may be extremely difficult to obtain now -- it
has been taken off the market in every country except for Spain.


Vincamine
     Benefits - increases blood flow to the brain while enhancing
the brain's use of oxygen.  This can help in conditions such as
vertigo, depression, hypertension, and mood changes, all which
are often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain.
     Warning - Very rarely causes stomach cramps, which will
disappear when usage is halted.


Vinpocetine
     Benefits - Since vinpocetine and vincamine are both extracts
of the periwinkle, they have similar functions.  Aids cerebral
functions by increasing blood flow to the brain, augmenting brain
molecular energy, and fully utilizing glucose and oxygen.
     Vinpocetine is used in Europe to treat many illnesses
related to poor cerebral circulation, including poor sight, poor
hearing, headaches, and memory problems.  Vinpocetine has even
been tested to improve memory even on healthy subjects.
     Warnings - Vinpocetine is safer than vincamine, and it's
side effects are rare.  They include high blood pressure, dry
mouth, and weakness.  Vinpocetine has no toxicity.


Phenytoin
     Benefits - Phenytoin is known best for its treatment of
epilepsy.  Phenytoin has been reported to increase several forms
of  cognition, in particular concentration.  It has been shown to
have a normalizing effect - persons who experience a lot of
anxiety or fear are calmed down, while passive people become more
assertive.
     Warnings - Sometimes causes a depletion of vitamin B-12 and
a increased need for thyroid hormone.


Propranolol Hydrochloride
     Benefits - Propranolol Hydrochloride blocks the receptor
site for adrenaline in muscular tissues.  When someone is afraid,
they release large quantities of adrenaline into the bloodstream,
causing increased heart rate, etc.  Often, this is an undesired
effect, particularly when the fear-inducing situation doesn't
call for fighting or fleeing.  By taking propranolol, you can
think clearly when fear would normally prevent such.
     Warnings - Lowers blood pressure.  Always take propranolol
with food, or it will cause nausea.  Never take propranolol
before an athletic event or when adrenaline would be useful.


Phenylalanine
     Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is converted to tyrosine
once inside the body, and stimulate mental capabilities.  It is a
popular ingredient in smart drinks.
Tyrosine
     Another amino acid, tyrosine is converted to dopamine, an
aggression enhancer and aphrodisiac, when in the body.



                              Vitamins
                           --------------

Vitamin B-1
     Benefits - Vitamin B-1 is an anti-oxidant, protecting the
nerve cells from harmful oxidizing agents.
     Dosage - 50-1000 mg/day in 3 doses.  All B vitamins are
water soluble, so the body cannot store them.


Vitamin B-3
     Benefits - Niacin has been shown in tests to increase memory
in healthy subjects by 10-40%.
     Dosage - 50-500 mg/day in 3 doses.  At high levels, vitamin
B- 3 can cause a "niacin rush," in which a flushing of the skin
and tingling occurs.  This rush is not harmful, and will
disappear after continued use.
     Warnings - People with high blood pressure, diabetes and
ulcers should only take niacin under a physician's supervision.


Vitamin B-5
     Benefits - B-5 enhances stamina and is a anti-oxidant.  B-5
is crucial for the formation of steroid hormones, and is
necessary for the conversion of acetylcholine from choline.
     Dosage - 250-1000 mg/day in 3 doses.
     Warnings - Large doses may cause diarrhea.  This symptom
will disappear after continued use.


Vitamin B-6
     Benefits - Crucial for the formation of many
neurotransmitters; serontin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in
particular.
     Dosage - 50-200 mg/day in 3 doses.
     Warnings - People using Dopa-L to treat Parkinson's disease
should not take B-6.  Dosages greater than 200 mg have been shown
to cause peripheral neuropathy.


Vitamin B-12
     Benefits - B-12 activates the synthesis of RNA in nerve
cells, treats depression, fatigue, and headaches.
     Dosage - 1 mg/day
     Warnings - excessive intake of B-12 may cause nosebleeds or
dry mouth.


Vitamin E
     Benefits - Vitamin E is a fat-soluble (so the body is able
to store) anti-oxidant, which helps delay aging.
     Dosage - 100-1000 mg/day.

                        Cyberpunk Art
                     -------------------

     As technology changes, so does the manner in which humans
create art.  The tools they use and the subjects they illustrate
reflects the technological atmosphere of that time.
     Below are some artists who represent the digital age of
technology.  Some use computers and digital electronics in their
creations, others merely illustrate the pervading atmosphere of
computers, electronics, global media, and instant communications.



                       Cyberpunk Music
                   ----------------------

     There is great debate to what constitutes "cyberpunk music."
In truth, cyberpunks themselves listen to whatever they want:
metal, rap, rock, jazz, classical, or techno.  But there are
certain types of music that embody the cyberpunk ethic: use of
computers and electronics, a appreciation for the underground,
and a "do it yourself" ethic.  Some bands choose to show this in
different ways: the militaristic overtones of Front 242, the
pure, sterile electronics of Kraftwerk, or the overt cyberpunk
aesthetics of Max M.

     "OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original
artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal,
scutiny, and distribution.  Digital immortality.
     The basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer
networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you
deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs
of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps
they'll be put into a different format, perhaps only surviving on
backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them
up.
     If that doesn't interest you...OTIS also offers a forum for
critique and exhibition of your works...a virtual art gallery
that never closes and exists in an information dimension where
your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing
monitors.  Suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by
merit of its stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of
light and electrons.
     Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery
and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep
your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the
gumption....that's what they're here for." (Ed Stastny, OTIS
director).
     The ftp sites also contain files on how to upload images.
     If you don't have access to the Internet, there is some OTIS
material on the Underground Cafe (402.339.0179) and CyberDen

body signals, such as brain waves, blood flow, heart rate, and
muscle stimulation.  He does this through attaching an assortment
of electronic equipment to his body, and plugging wires into his
flesh.
     Black Ice magazine interviewed Stelarc in their premier
issue.  Stelarc has an audio recording out on Anckarstrom
Recordings (Sweden).

Kodak Center for Creative Imaging
     Course catalog of "creative imaging," which is the "art" of

Flipping through the catalog reminds me a lot of Mondo 2000, and
I wasn't surprised to see that Mr. Bart Nagel (photo editor of
Mondo 2000) teaches a class.  Let's hope creative imaging is a
fad and not a trend.

415.641.8065
     SRL is a performance art group from San Francisco CA.  It
was started in the late 70's by Mark Pauline, who took the name
from an ad he saw in an old issue of Soldier of Fortune magazine.
     SRL builds death robots - frightening machines that spew
fire, have swinging blades, spiked wheels, and cannons - and then
sets them loose in open parking lots.  Some of these machines
fight each other, some gang up on larger, bully-robots, others
wander around aimlessly smashing whatever is in their way, and
others threaten the crowd.  These robot wars are an orgy of
broken glass, leaking fuel, scraping metal, fiery explosions, and
blood and gore from slaughtered animal carcasses.
     Survival Research Labs names each one of its spectacles with
cheerful names like "Bitter Messages of Hopeless Grief" and
"Careless Abuse of Premeditated Uncertainty."
     Lately, SRL has been getting more and more high-tech.  They
have acquired very advanced equipment from military and
industrial sources (most likely as a result of government
cutbacks in the military).  One of the more interesting devices
SRL uses at their shows is a machine that resonates at the exact
frequency that the human body resonates, causing the crowd to
shake uncontrollably.
     SRL sells videos and posters of their shows, plus a press
book ($7).  Write for a price list.

           Cyberpunk Films, Movies, Shows and Videos
        -----------------------------------------------

Blade Runner
     Blade Runner is the quintessential cyberpunk film, and
perhaps the first visualization of a cyberpunk world, predating
even Gibson's Neuromancer.  Blade Runner is loosely based on
Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.
     The setting for the film is Los Angeles in the year 2019:
gigantic skyscrapers and bright neon signs and billboards dwarf
the inhabitants below.  Life on the street is urban chaos - mixes
of different races, predominantly non-white, pack the raining
streets, all speaking a polyglot-street-tongue.
     The story involves a "blade runner," Deckard, to come out of
retirement to hunt down renegade replicants.  A replicant is an
android manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation that possesses
characteristics so human it is nearly impossible to tell the
difference.  Blade Runners are the "police" that hunt down and
kill replicants that are out of control.  Throughout the movie,
the director (Ridley Scott) plays on the notion that the androids
are really more "human" than the human blade runners.  This seems
to be a theme that Philip K Dick used often in his stories: the
question of what constitutes humanity.
     But it is the scenes in Blade Runner, and not the plot, that
make the movie the lush spectacle it is.
     There are two versions of Blade Runner: the one released to
audiences in 1982 and the far superior directors cut, released in
1992.
     The book, Retrofitting Blade Runner , is a collection of
critical essays about Blade Runner.
     The Blade Runner FAQ in ftp.u.washington.edu in the
directory /public/alt.cyberpunk.



Total Recall
     Another movie based on a story by Philip K Dick.  In an
attempt to escape his dull life, Arnold Schwarzenegger visits a
company that implants "memories" of exciting, action-packed
vacations.  He chooses to be a secret agent in the Mars colony as
his "vacation."  Throughout the film, both Arnold and the
audience are unsure if he really is a secret agent, or if the
whole movie is an implant.



THX 1138
     George Lucas's first major film is set in the far future
where humanity lives in subterranean cities.  The cities are
governed by computers, policed by robots, and are unsettling
clean and sterile.  Citizens are forced to take drugs that
inhibit their passions, and are assigned alphanumeric codes
instead of names.  The action starts when one citizen, THX-1138,
cuts back on his drug ration and falls in love with another
citizen.



Lawnmower Man
     A half-wit is mentally augmented with smart drugs,
computers, and virtual reality until he reaches god-like mental
powers.   Slow pace, bizarre editing, and inane handling cripple
this movie, but the special effects might warrant a rental.



Terminator I and II
     Robots from a machine and computer controlled future travel
time to assassinate the young leader of the human rebel movement.
     Absolutely stunning visual effects.



Videodrome
     A sleaze-TV executive scans satellite channels and discovers
a mysterious channel that broadcasts a torture program entitled
Videodrome.  The program broadcasts some sort of mind-control
frequency causing its viewers to hallucinate and become more
violent.  The tv exec investigates and finds out a man, Brian
O'Blivion is behind Videodrome.  The problem is, no one has ever
seen O'Blivion - he exists only on reels and reels of television
footage.



Naked Lunch
     David Cronenberg's film of the making of Naked Lunch, the
novel.  Peter Weller plays Burroughs perfectly - the suit and
hat, and the detached, hollow look.  Most of the movie has
Burroughs traveling to and from the Interzone, where he meets a
assortment of buglike creatures.



Tetsuo, the Iron Man
     Japanese splatter/super-hero film about a man who dicovers
one day that wires are growing out of his skin.  He slowly
becomes more and more consumed by wires and metal.  Highly
disturbing film.



Akira
     Akira is a animated Japanese film set in post-nuclear war
Neo- Tokyo.  Roving gangs and factions fight in streets lined
with megalithic skyscrapers, while the government experiments
with a force of pure energy called Akira.



Max Headroom
     Postmodern/cyberpunk TV show that is set "20 minutes in the
Future."  The world of Max Headroom is controlled by conglomerate
TV stations and corporations.  Some episodes, including the
excellent pilot show, is available on video.



Robocop I and II
     A near-future Detroit is rampant with crime, police are
striking, and a mega-corporation wants to market robot policemen.
Unfortunately for the mega-corp, their first Robocop has memories
from his past life as a real cop and hunts down the villains that
previously killed him.
     The less successful, but still darkly funny, Robocop II
deals with high-powered drugs, child drug-dealers, and the
subverting of governments by high-powered corporations.



The Mind's Eye and Beyond the Mind's Eye
     Hour-long videos of the best computer animation.  These
videotapes can be bought from most videostores.



Wargames
     The movie that simultaneously inspired a generation of
hackers and made the public paranoid of computer intrusion.
     Wargames is the story of a ne'er-do-well high-school student
who accidentally breaks into the US Defense computer, causing it
to prepare for nuclear war.



Mad Max Series
     The Mad Max series of films is the reversal of the typical
cyberpunk scene of overcrowded urban landscapes - they are set in
barren Australian deserts after some sort of apocalypse.  Nomadic
gangs of maruaders fight for gasoline and food, or attack
primitive settlements.  Mad Max is an ex-cop who aids the
settlers against the car gangs.



                                Raves
                             -----------

     Raves are all-night parties, open to anyone, but usually
held in secret places. Directions to these locations are usually
on a colorful flyer, which is often doubled as a ticket and
"invitation." Like any youth-driven party, loud music is played,
chemical substances are consumed, and participants dance wildly.
     Supposedly the combination of these elements promotes a
sense of comradery among participants. Raves are considered to be
the total subjective experience - everyone is being bombarded
with sensory stimuli and somehow throughout the night they
develop some sort of kinship.  Raves also have the distinction of
having the worst fashion among any musical trend, perhaps even
disco.



                                Music
                             -----------

     The music of choice at rave is usually techno, which is
divided into several genres: classic electronic dance (like
Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode), house (electronics with soul or rap
vocals), acid house (a more liquidy version of house),  ambient
(new age-like, repetitive, calming), Tribal (electronic trance
inducing music, like the drums of the prehistoric man), and
hardcore techno (straight, fast driving beat, often without
vocals).  The DJ is the supreme master of the rave - it is he who
selects and manipulates the music in a fashion that will sate the
revelers.



                               Visuals
                            -------------

     Rave visuals include computer graphics displayed on a large
screen TV or videowall, strobe lights, lasers, videotape loops,
and the actual ravers themselves.  Ravers try to outdo each other
in the outlandishness of their costumes, producing an overall
tacky effect.



                                Drugs
                             -----------

     To further distort their state of consciousness, a raver may
take a rainbow of drugs, vitamins, and chemicals.  Popular
substances include smart drugs, Nitrous Oxide (taken from whipped
cream cans), acid, ecstasy, and (somewhat mundane among these
other chemicals) marijuana.
     Ecstasy - also known as methylenedimethoxymethamphetamine,
MDMA, X, or XTC.  Ecstasy was created in the 1910's but was not
available until the early 1970's, when it became a popular drug
with the hippy crowd.  In 1985, it was declared illegal by the
United States government.
     Ecstasy is noted for it's ability to amplify emotions,
increase energy, and promote empathy and acceptance of other
people.
     Ecstasy has many annoying side effects, such as increased
heart rate, higher blood pressure, an increase in body
temperature, and muscle tension.  Also, Ecstasy bought on the
street usually contains impurities - usually LSD, PCP, or heroin.
     The Usenet group alt.drugs has more information on Ecstasy
(among other things...).

Hyperdelic Video
737 Pine Street #5
San Francisco CA

     From their promo sheet:
     "Hyperdelic video is a San Francisco/Tokyo based
"transmedia" company involved in the fields of video, computer
graphics, live visual display system design, electronic music,
performance art, fashion, and graphic design.  Formed in 1988 in
Tokyo, Japan by two Australian artists (Andrew Frith and David
Richardson) Hyperdelic is recognized as one of the pioneers of
"cyber-video" or "video- drug" as it is known in Japan.  Their
work has appeared on both American and Japanese cable, satellite,
and national TV and they have collaborated on projects with many
of the leading names in the music, art, and scientific
communities including Psychic TV, Adrian Sherwood, The Shamen,
808 State, Moby, Derek May, EMF, Dee-lite, Pop Will Eat Itself,
YMO, Altern-8, E-lustrious, Dr. Timothy Leary, NHK Enterprises,
Telepresence Research, Anarchic Adjustment, and Eastern Bloc
records.
     With the increased data handling capabilities that the
"digitization" of mass media has enabled, there is an increasing
trend for information and data to be presented visually and where
possible interactively.  It is interesting to note that in the
English language the idiom "I see" denotes complete
understanding.  The "RAMification of information" has enabled
what is being labelled "multi-media" to emerge whereby separately
discrete media are being linked together via special interfacing.
Hyperdelic aims to go beyond  "multi-media" and hopes to be part
of the "Transmedia" revolution that has just begun, a revolution
where all media will appear to merge into one, the borders
between one and another will blur and where new modes of
communication will be conceived."
     Each Hyperdelic tape has a musical theme (house, industrial,
ambient, techno, etc.) and each is one hour long.  Tapes are $20
and include postage and handling if ordered in the US; all other
orders add $3.

                        Virtual Reality
                    -----------------------

     In a Virtual Reality, a computer acts as a mediator between
flesh and an artificially created environment.
     To be true Virtual reality, a system must be three things.
     First, it must be totally immersive.  Usually, a computer
only offers a flat surface for display in the form of a CRT or a
LCD panel.  VR allows the display to be three dimensional and a
full 360 degrees of panorama, plus a display on top and below.
Sound and touch add to the total immersion effect.  This output
is given by a variety of devices, including head mounted
displays, stereoscopic lenses, tactile feedback devices, and
stereo headphones.
     Second, VR must be navigable - you must be able to explore
it.  This is done through input devices like eye position
trackers, Six dimensional mice, head movement trackers, and
glove-like pointing devices.
     Third, VR must be manipulative.  You must be able to
interact with the environment.  This can be done through devices
like a data glove (you can "pick up" things) and tactile feedback
(you can actually "feel" the surface of "objects").
     The benefits of VR are obvious.  Of course the entertainment
industry is scrambling to develop VR systems.  Many games
incorporate the second and third elements, but the first is still
too costly.  The medical and engineering fields are also
interested in  VR, and an architect will have the chance to "walk
through" his creation before it is even built.  Of course, VR has
military uses as well - pilots can steer warplanes that are miles
away and have no fear of putting their lives on the line.
Through virtual reality, wars can reach a level of video game
entertainment.
     Virtual Reality also offers an exciting possibility for
computer networks like the Internet.  Instead of sending
electronic mail or convening at certain chat sites (which are
presently all text only) people can meet "in person" and interact
with each other as if they were corporeal. But VR has a long way
to go before those days.
     Virtual Reality has become a fad and buzzword of the early
nineties. A lot of hype surrounds it now, but for VR to even be
considered a consumer reality, the costs of the equipment must go
down drastically.  The spearhead of the industry will probably be
home entertainment systems, like the Sega and Super Nintendo.

Cheap VR - It is possible to run a VR system on a souped up Mac
or 486+ or Unix Workstation right now, but the prices still run a
little high for equipment.  One alternative is to convert
hardware like the Mattel Powerglove or Sega VR equipment into
input devices and use one of the many public domain or shareware
VR programs as your developing kit.  The best sources for
information of this sort can be found in the magazine PCVR and
the sci.virtual-worlds newsgroup.



                          VR Companies
                       ------------------

FRED13
Robitron Software Research, Inc.
228 Hampton St.
Rockmart GA

     FRED13 is a dialogue generator program, sort of like Eliza,
except that he can learn phrases indefinitely.  Instead of
looking for key words, like many AI programs, FRED searches for
statistically close matches to an input phrase.  Plus, FRED can
remember most a conversation, and he can use parts of it again
later in the conversation.
     The FRED13 demo has 12 000 phrase/response records, but it
can't learn any new phrases.  It's big enough to hold a
conversation, though.  Requires IBM PC with at least 7.1 megs on
the hard drive.  Write for details.
     The full learning version of FRED13  is available for DOS,
UNIX, XENIX, and AIX platforms.  Non-DOS platforms requires
DataFlex Full Development liscense; DOS version without source
code includes DataFlex runtime.
     Price $199.95 all platforms.

The Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky
     Marvin Minsky, cofounder of the AI Lab at MIT, explores the
structure of human intellegence.  Minsky believes the mind is
made up of smaller agents that act together - hence a "society of
mind."


Mind Children by Hans Moravec
     Roboticist Hans Moravec persuasively argues, using the
technological pace of the past century, that within 40 years our
machines will achieve human equivalence.  After this benchmark
has been reached, their growth will continue while human
development stagnates.  Moravec asserts that this postbiological
world will not be frightening, but merely a natural step.


War in the Age of Intelligent Machines by Manuel DeLanda
     DeLanda explores the possibilities of artificial
intelligence being integrated into weapons systems.


AI: The Tumultuous History of the Search of Artificial
Intelligence by Daniel Crevier
     Chronicles the history of artificial intelligence, the
players, the programmers, the programs, the struggles, the
victories, and the shifts of one technique to another.  A very
good book for understanding the basics and history of AI.

                   Artificial Life and Robotics
                ----------------------------------

     Artificial life includes any man-made system that exhibits
certain properties that would constitute "life," such as autonomy
and reproduction/replication.  This would include (but not
limited to) robotics and computer programs that are able to
develop into new life forms through mutation or natural selection
(this classification would include certain computer viruses).

TIERRA
Virtual Life
POB 625
Newark DE
19715
ftp'able from tierra.slhs.udel.edu or life.slhs.udel.edu
in dir tierra.  $65; $20 for an update. Comes with source code
and
executables.
     Tierra was developed by Dr. Thomas Ray from the University
of Deleware.  Tierra's source code, which is written in C,
creates a virtual computer within your computer that comes
complete with an operating system.  The virtual computer's
executable files have the ability to evolve, and display signs of
"life."
     Mutations can occur either by recombining the lines of code,
or by random bit switching.  Then, natural selection takes over
as the different forms of code fight it out in a battle to win
CPU time for more self-replication.
     The operation system of Tierra provides three different
mutation rates to triple your fun and random disturbances to
throw wrenches into the works.
     Tierra keeps records of the births and deaths , and
maintains a genebank for successful "organisms."
     After you watch Tierra for a while, strange things will
start to happen as the organic soup evolves: host/parasite
relationships develop, evolutionary wars and peaces, mass
diversity, and unpredictable events that throw everything into a
mess.
     Knowledge of C and Assembler is a must for the operation of
Tierra.


SimLife by Maxis
     From  the same people who produced SimCity comes SimLife,
the most game-like of artificial life programs.  Like a mad
scientist, you design and create life forms and influence their
evolution.  Throw them into an environment of your design and
watch them survive and proliferate, or crash and burn.  You can
even manipulate your creations' genetic structure to mutate them
further.  SimLife has better graphics than the other A-life
programs, and doesn't require programming knowledge.
     $50.00 from Media Magic.  Also available in most computer
stores.


Simulated Evolution by Michael Palmiter, Ph.D.
     Simulated Evolution is a simulation of predator/prey
situations.  The setting is at the bottom of a lake where little
bugs swim around and eat the smaller bacteria.  Each bug's
demeanor is dictated by its genetic code - some are more
aggressive than others, some are "smarter," et cetera.  When a
bug reaches a certain level of "maturity," it is able to produce
offspring with different genetic structure than its parent.
Through genetics and luck only the fittest survive.
     $40 from Media Magic.


Cellular Automata Lab by Rudy Rucker and Autodesk
     CA Lab allows the user to create artificial life, simulate
physical and biological procedures (including ecological patterns
and chemical reactions).  Knowledge of C, Pascal, or BASIC is a
requirement.  CA Lab comes with a comprehensive manual that
serves as an introduction to cellular automata.
     $55 from Media Magic.


The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins
     This program is best used as a companion to the book of the
same name.  The user breeds different organisms, and The Blind
Watchmaker simulates the process in which very advanced forms of
life have arisen through the Darwinian concept of natural
selection.
     $16 from Media Magic.
Creating Artificial Life by Edward Rietman
     Author Edward Rietman examines different definitions of
life, and applies them to the realms of robotics, cellular
automata, and artificial intelligence.  Programs in BASIC and C
are provided to explore variations of artificial life - including
computer viruses and self-governing robots.
     $30 for book and disk from Media Magic.

                      -----------------------

     Every technphile loves gadgets - the clever, small
electronic gizmos that are impressive if, in truth, somewhat
useless.  This love of gadgets perhaps stems from childhood
heroes - be it Dick Tracy, James Bond, or Maxwell Smart.  The
following is a list of
(mostly) free catalogs that offer discount or inexpensive
gadgets.

cheap either because they buy it direct or the line has been
discontinued.  Each entry is written by DAK's founder and
president, Drew Andrew Kaplan.  After you get a few of these
catalogs, you'll be used to the weird names he gives to his
products - a remote control device becomes a "marriage Saver,"
and a paper shredder is called a "Snooper Stomper."  What do you
expect from a guy who calls his buyers "fellow DAKonians"???

                          The Internet
                       ------------------

     The Internet offers the chance to travel around the world
through your computer.  It is the largest network of computers in
the world, and has connection in every continent and every
country. It grows daily and hundreds of businesses, libraries,
universities, and governments are plugged into it.
     Unfortunately, the Internet is not the easiest place to
explore, and suffers from a lack of set standards.  The best
place to get information on the Internet is through one of the
following books (Krol's Whole Internet being the best).



                 Internet Books and Publications
              -------------------------------------
The Matrix by John Quarterman
     History, protocols, and services of the world's major,
minor, and private computer networks.  The interdependency of
these networks is also discussed.


The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog by Ed Krol
     Krol has written the most useful book on the Internet - if
you are either a beginner or a veteran, this book is
indispensable.  Includes easy to follow instructions for ftp,
telnet, gopher, and archie, among other Internet resources.
     The back section of the book is devoted to the Whole
Internet Catalog, a guide net resources on everything from
aeronautics to zymurgy.  Highly recommended.

Echo
97 Perry Street, Suite 13
New York NY
10014
212.255.3839
     ECHO (East Coast Hang Out) is similar to it's cousin the
WELL on the other coast, but lacks the WELL's Californian
ambience.  Based in Greenwich village, ECHO is New York to the
bone.  And what makes this board really stand out is that its
owner (Stacy Horn) and 40% of the users are women.
     ECHO offers special interest conferences and e-mail.
     Cost is $18.95 a month ($12.95 for students and elderly) for

     FidoNet really isn't part of the Internet, but it connects
to it in some places.  It's sort of like a large number of
bulletin boards all connected sharing and spreading data.
FidoNet is pretty low-tech and cumbersome, but it does the trick.
Incidentally, many bulletin boards in Eastern European countries
and former Soviet Union republics are primarily linked via
FidoNet.
