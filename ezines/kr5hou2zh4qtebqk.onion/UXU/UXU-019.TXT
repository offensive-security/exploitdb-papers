     The first case of OOOOooooing was found on the islands of OOOOoooo.
     When General Von Ohitssobig found the island, he immediately ordered
     the crew of his ship to explore and search for hidden treasures, but
     all they found was a tribe of women with a disease so bad they couldn't
     stop it by themselves. All of them had the same symptoms, they needed
     sex 24hrs a day. Before General Von Ohitssobig discovered the village
     the women had to satisfy each other, and had never seen a man.

     The women were all daughters of the most beautiful woman known to man,
     and therefor the reaction of the crew wasn't too unpredictable.
     After about 9 months, 283 babies were born in the village, all of them
     girls. 21 years later, another ship found the island. Captain Evenbigger
     and his crew camped on the island over 200 days. Almost 9 months later
     368 babies were born, and once again, all of them were girls.

     This trend kept going on for about 200 years, and last year when the
     Crownsend Fleet, led by Admiral Icantbelieveitssobig reached the island
     they didn't believe what they saw. 1204 Beautiful 21-Year-Old,
     625 21-Year-Old, 311 21-Year-Old, 150 21-Year-Old, 60 21-Year-Old,
     25 21-Year-Old and 1 21-Year-Old women met them when they reached the
     beach, wearing the sexiest underwear they could imagine. Perfect bodies,
     and young, playful, wonderful faces.

     After one hour, one of those sailors looked like this:

                            [|  \/  \/  |]      /  OOOOoooo !!!   \

                                \____/    


     Another looked just like this (other colors possible though)

                               ________
                              /        \
                              \:.:..:.:/\          _____________

                             |          |        /               \
                            [|  \/  \/  |]      /  OOOOoooo !!!   \

                             |    ..    |       /________________/
                              \        /
                               \   O  /
                                \____/    

     And the third one....


                              \:.:..:.:/           _____________
                              /;;;;;;;;\          /             \

                            ["(#/"&(!"TG"]      /  OOOOoooo !!!   \
                             (!=("!&"#&(()      \                 /
                            !"&/(&//))/=(       /________________/
                              "()/"/"(()
                               ("()#"U(
                                "/(#)/    


     (he was a really messed-up kid you know...)


     But all of them had that look on their face (except for the 3rd one
     for obvious reasons).

     And That's the story of the Island of OOOOoooo.

     The first man you ask? Well, he represents a normal person when he
     hear about the island where no-one grows older than 21 and where
     only the most beautiful girls are born,


      THE ISLAND OF OOOOoooo which is only found once in a lifetime!
