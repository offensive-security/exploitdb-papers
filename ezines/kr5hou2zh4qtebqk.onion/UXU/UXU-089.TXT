         The Ivan Chronicles - Downtown Julie Brown Spills Her Guts


You wander through the darkness aimlessly. Having been kidnapped by
the fiendish Pompeo Posar, and taken to his Domain to wander to be
tortured by the sights, you stumble down the hallways...

Only a few short minutes pass before you find yourself standing in front of
the large wooden door to the chamber. You grasp the cold steel handle and
give it a slight pull. The door opens easily and you slip into the chamber
under the cover of darkness.

Once inside, you take position behind a pile of wood near the fireplace.
After a few moments, your eyes adjust to the darkness. Looking around
the large chamber you immediately notice a single figure against the
far wall. Suddenly, from the main door of the chamber, another, much
larger figure, enters the chamber. It sluggishly makes its way to the
fireplace and sets a small torch aflame. With the room now partially lit,
the two figures in the room are no longer a mystery... the larger is to no
surprise, the headmaster Pompeo Posar. The other is more difficult to place.
It is a female with dark hair. She appears to be bound by her wrists and
ankles to the wall. Suddenly the silence is broken by a deep and heavy
voice...

      "Now you're REALLY downtown, babe... wubba-wubba-wubba!"

Gasp! Pompeo Posar has captured Downtown Julie Brown from the MTV networks!
You sit behind the wood pile in newfound excitement as you could never quite
stand the bitch, her fascist dance show and her goddamned teabag
accent.

Pompeo Posar selects two items from his tool chest. A silvery pair of tree
branch cutters is set upon a small table placed a few short feet from Miss.
Brown. The other, a long thin blade, is kept firmly in Pompeo Posar's right
hand. At this point Miss. Brown begins to realize that this isn't any MTV
prank, and that she is indeed about to experience a colossal amount of pain.

A devilish grin slides across your face as Pompeo Posar removes the gag
from Julie's ill complected face. Her screams of terror almost
immediately fill the chamber. Pompeo Posar positions the gleaming blade at
the base of Julie's throat.

             "Your voice has always annoyed me.", Pompeo Posar exclaims

Instantly the blade pierces the tender skin of Julie's throat and exits
out the back of her neck. Pompeo Posar then removes the blade as easily
as it entered, uttering only a faint laugh.

Gasping for each breath, Julie is now fighting for her life.
Pompeo Posar once again positions the blade at the base of her neck.

Slowly and gently it travels in a downward motion, through the ruffles and
over the spandex where it comes to a sudden halt. Even from your distance,
you can easily see the fright in Miss. Brown's eyes as she now remains
frozen in fear. Without wasting a moment, the blade is driven directly
into Julie's lower abdomen. In a rude hacking motion, Pompeo Posar delivers
violent cuts, each one deeper than the next, tearing muscle from bone.

Julie's cries of anguish blanket the entire chamber. Then, just as quickly
as it began, it has ended. Pompeo Posar unexpectedly drops the blade and
takes a casual step back. Miss. Brown is now nearly motionless. With a
single cut through her neck and her entire lower abdomal area mutilated,
Julie now has little inspiration to dance.

You can see the exhaustion in Miss. Brown's eyes. Watery and red, they gaze
unknowingly into the darkness of the chamber.

   "You'll be taking an extended vacation, Miss. Brown", Pompeo Posar
mutters.

You notice Pompeo Posar now has the branch cutters in his hands and is
walking toward Julie. The cold eerie snapping of the blades sends shivers
down your spine that seem to continue down to your toes. You can see
Pompeo Posar carefully adjusting the blades, opening them about 4 inches,
and thrusting them deeply into the cavity he himself created in her
abdomen. The blades now surround Julie's spine, each positioned with loving
care. With only the slightest pause, Pompeo Posar closes the branch cutters
with all of his strength, instantly severing Miss. Brown's spine.

You leave the chamber, slipping quietly out through the shadows and
corners with a feeling of pleasure and contentment..
