                          Fun With Electricity...


  Oh dear oh dear... Hobby Terrorists of today seem to have forgot one of the
most flexible tools in our time, electricity.
Since you all know what it is :) I'll jump to the next section at once, how 
to use it in a true HT-way.


1) Light Chock (funny name, ey?)

   Ok, the "light bulb bomb" was a success, but there are more effective ways
   to torment your enemies. This is simple (most things are); open the
   lights on/off button on the wall you want to prepare for your "friend",
   take out the wires (there's two), and cut them open, [NOTE: THERE'S SOME
   HEAVY VOLTAGE COMING YOUR WAY THROUGH THOSE WIRES, SO BE CAREFUL! ED.]
   so the copper/steel cables inside are visible (about one or two inches).
   Now, place the naked wires horizontal cross the button, and put tape on
   both sides to make it stick (see example below).



         Light Chock

         -----------------------
         |                     |       ...... = naked wire
         |   ---------------   |
         |   |Button       |   |           MM = tape
         |   |MM.........MM.>  |
         |   |MM         MM|   |            > = where the wire is put back
         |   |MM.........MM.>  |                behind the button, into the
         |   |MM         MM|   |                wall
         |   |             |   |
         |   ---------------   |
         |                     |
         -----------------------

  As this is surely easy to notice, of course you do this in a button that's
  in some dark place. A closet, first light in the hallway etc etc.

  As we say, have fun!
