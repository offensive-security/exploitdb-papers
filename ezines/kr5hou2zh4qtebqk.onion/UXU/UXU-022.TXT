                No! I ain't buyin' that shit no more!
                Burn...Burn...Burn...Burn to the core!

                    You understand what I'm saying,
            'cause you're my mentor, the only true believer.
                  Muthafuckers' the only ones paying,
             they're the real suckers, the real deceivers.

               Now Fifteen ELiTe's hanging from a tree,
               My mentor really knows how to pleeze me.
          Killed, stabbed, burned, fucked, muthafuckin' dead,
           Eat dust, Eat shit, Then you'll taste Joe's lead,
  From the corner, shot from behind, a 10 in the head... Boom you're dead!

                   Watch your back, watch your face,
                You defy me? Man.. anytime, anyplace!
            You ain't seen shit yet, so I put you face-down,
                            down the toilet.

               Yo! Now you see? Your mirror in the shit,
           I'll push you down, down, until I'll make you fit.
               You think we're through? Man, fuck you!
        Get lost, get real, because now, it's time for the glue.

            Head down the toilet, your ass smeared with glue,
       I get my collection of dynamite, and the kitchen knife too.
                You beg for mercy, you cry like a lamer,
              Cass, The knife, MY knife, lets me tame her.
         Just another one, <sshhh> down your glue-filled ass,
       Funny, I thought 30 would fit, I better make use of Cass.

                     One Two Three, then I'm gone,
                     Listen G, your ass is a bomb.
