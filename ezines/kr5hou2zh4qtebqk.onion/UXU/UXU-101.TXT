               HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY WRITE AN "EROTIC" TEXT FILE
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
 
  
  Many  people  wants  to write text files and earn fame and fortune today.
This  is  not easy if you both want someone to actually READ what you write
and  like it at the same time.  You must own a great deal of talent for the
written  language,  you  must  understand  what  separates a good file from
rubbish.   A  good file could be anything from a high-explosive that no one
ever  has  written  about before, to deep poems or fiction that thrills the
reader.   Bad files are those that no one reads because they do not include
any new ideas.
  But!,  if  you  have  not  got  any  new ideas, fresh information or wild
imagination,  there  is still hope for you.  Yes!  Yes!  Do as thousands of
other people with only half a brain does every day!

  Write an erotic text file.

  Yes!   This  is  a  part of the text file scene that does not require any
talent at all, nor some new ideas!  You only have to let your fingers dance
over the keyboard long enough and viola!  You have a file.  Do it again and
you have another file.  Do it three times and you are famous!
  To help you get started here is the complete guide!
  
  
  1.  THE NAME
  
  At  first  you  need a name of the file.  No problems.  Name it after the
girl  in  the  file,  or  after  the  situation  that  will  lead  to  the
love-making.
  Examples:  "Jenny", "Rita", "The new girl at the gas station".
                 

  2.  THE BEGINNING

  This  depends  on  how  long you want the file to be.  If you plan a long
file, write megs of crap about the girl herself that no one reads anyway.
  Example:  "Oh, Mausolea was a real hot gal that never could get enough of
dick  in  her  little  pussy  that always wanted more and more.  Her mother
however was deep religious and had not touched a man in forty years...  "
 

  3.  THE MEETING

  Boy  meet  girl.   Girl  meet  boy.  Alternative:  Girl meet ten boys and
participate in a brutal gang-bang.  Just let the girl and the boy meet each
other  in  a common way (no one wants extreme and unbelievable fantasies in
the  beginning,  they  must  come  later)  like  on the gas station or at a
wedding  or  at  a  public  lavatory.  If you are a bit experienced you can
"tease"  the  reader.  This is done by letting the boy see the girl several
times and describe her marvelous body before he drills her.
  Example:   "For the third day I saw her again standing by the phone-booth
with  those  big breasts and marvelous legs that screamed for me.  Suddenly
she  began  to  talk to me.  She said:  - Let's go to my apartment and have
a drink."
 

  4. THE ACT

  You  have  now  reached the only part of your file that is actually read.
This  is  why  you  must  be extra detailed in your descriptions of what is
happening.   Take  your  time, use plenty of space to tell the reader about
what  kind  of  exotic  knickers  the girl is using, and what store she has
bought them in, if they were on sale or expensive etc.
  Do  not  write  like  this:   "Then  I pressed my cock into her pussy and
immediately came.  It was great!"
  This is better:  "- I love you, I said.  - Me too, she said.  - I know, I
said.   Then  I carefully let my big red pounding rocket of love slide into
her  wet  hot  deep  cave  of pleasure.  We moved our beautiful bodies in a
steady  rhythm,  until  the  orgasm  struck  us.  It felt like I had put my
fingers in a high voltage socket."
  NOTE.   Of  course, you cannot go for the finale at once.  First you must
go through the standard actions.  They are (in the right order):

   1- They kiss (not necessary, but it gives a more romantic mood)
   2- Boy suck girl's nipples.
   3- Girl suck dick.
   4- Boy lick pussy.
   5- THE EXTRA FEATURE.  This must be the special happening of the act and
      therefore be a bit different.  Examples:  69-position, boy shave
      girl, girl shave boy (unusual, but works), girl kick boy's nuts (S/M
      only), boy whip girl etc etc
      Penetration.  Any position will do.
   6- The HAPPY end - both have a satisfying orgasm and promise each other
      eternal love.


  5.  THE END

  Now  you  have reached the end.  You can end your story in many ways, but
of  course  not in any unexpected way.  It would be rather shocking for the
reader  if  he,  with  the  dick in his hand in the middle of his jerk-off,
suddenly reads that the boy smashed the girl's brains to pieces with a iron
stick.  No, the end must be romantic.
  Example:   "I  never  saw Mhariah again after our night together, but she
will  forever  live in my memory.".  Even if Mhariah is working at the same
job  as  the  hero,  he will never ever see her again.  A sex-file does not
have to include common sense.
  And  DO NOT end the story with something really off-putting like "I think
of  her all the time...  when I masturbate." It may be true (it would be in
real  life  anyway),  but  remember  that you have written the file for the
reader and not the kinky little hero in your text file.
