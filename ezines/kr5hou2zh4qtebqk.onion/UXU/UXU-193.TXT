                 The more I come to think about the question
               of morality, the more absurd it becomes.  How
               can  man  care  about  a thing like morality?
               Through all history, man has felt a need for,
               let us call it an excuse, for his behavior.


                 The problem is that it is simply an excuse,
               not a guide line for ones behavior.  It never
               makes  any difference in the end.  There will
               never be any changes in mans behavior because
               he  can  not find any excuse for his actions.
               He will simply invent a proper excuse for his
               behavior.   Man  will  continue  his striving
               for POWER and PROFIT whether he does it under
               the  heading  Morality  or  not.   The  whole
               question of  morality seems to me a little ad
               hoc.    Why  bother   about  justifying  ones
               behavior  when  it  is  already controlled by
               such  strong  interests  as POWER and PROFIT.
               The answer is that man has a strong desire to
               feel  that  what  he do is the right thing.
                 

                 Take  the  example of USA's behavior in the
               gulf-war.   Their excuse was the suffering of
               the   Kuwaiti  population,  but   their  real
               concern  was,  of course, the oil.  But would
               the  UN  take USA's interest in the oil as an
               excuse    to    kill   thousands   of   Iraqi
               civilians?   My  point  is that even if USA's
               interest  was  the  oil, it  was important to
               justify the attack in one way or the other.


                 Man  are  not willing to admit that he acts
               from  feelings of greed or profit hunger.  It
               is  much  nicer  to  think of the acts as the
               normative  implications  of  some  "good"  or
               altruistic  moral  theory.  This moral theory
               does  not  have  to  be  a  whole  consistent
               theory.  It is  often  a so called "Christian
               Morality".


                 The nice thing with "Christian Morality" is
               that  nobody  can tell exactly what normative
               implications  that  follows from it.  This is
               because  it is not clear  which higher  rules
               the normative implications is the product of.


                 When  USA  is  acting  God in some conflict
               they  do  this  with  the  excuse  that their
               "Christian  Morality" demands this from them.
               And  because  their morality is so "flexible"
               they  can  use it as an excuse for almost any
               behavior.   It  is  not  hard to see why this
               "morality(?)"  is  so  useful  to USA and the
               rest  of  the western world in their constant
               attempts  to   become   God,  Master  of  the
               Universe.
