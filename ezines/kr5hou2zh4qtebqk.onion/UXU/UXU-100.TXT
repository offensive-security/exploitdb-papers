    Who'd ever believe we'd make it this far? Not me, that's for sure.
    Celebrating the 100th uXu file, we'd like to go back, and look at
    the time that has passed since the very first uXu-file.


    Without thought, plans or even members, The Chief set out to start
    a sidetrack-group (August 1991). The plan was to make it a group
    for writers, and it was to publish anything that was submitted to or
    written for the group. At the same time, The Chief was a member, and
    co-leader of another group, a group of hackers that only published
    hacking-related text files. As hacking-related text files wasn't the
    only thing The Chief wrote, he thought it would be a good idea to
    start a separate group, for those other text files.


    Along with Phearless, another member of the hacker group, they
    started to discuss names for the group, and after a couple of
    weeks of dumb, humorous, already taken and gross names, they decided
    on Underground eXperts United (uXu). During this time, the other
    members of the hacker group heard about their plans and started to
    accuse The Chief for being a traitor, starting a group of his own
    without the others. The "discussion" got out of hand and The Chief
    decided to leave the hacker group, to be able to go ahead with uXu.


    In September 1991, the first set of uXu files were released in Sweden,
    all written by The Chief, due to lack of other members. A week after
    the release, The GNN joined uXu and added a bunch of files to the 
    uXu series which finally became the first uXu world-wide release.
    The first set of files varied between fiction and anarchy. The GNN
    supplied the anarchy and The Chief fiction. "We received a lot of
    response to the initial release, not all good, but who said that we
    would satisfy everyone anyway?" At the same time, uXu started searching
    for members and contributors to manage a second release pretty much
    like the first one within reasonable time. A few people answered but
    never managed to write anything unfortunately.


    At the end of October 1991, the time had come for the second release
    and the premiere for Phearless' files under the uXu label. The release
    was named "The Weird release", because it basically contained a lot of
    weird files and general weirdness. "After this release, we got messages
    from "well-known" writers from other groups (mostly in the U.S.) who
    wanted us to know they were interested in writing something for us,
    although we haven't received anything from any of them yet, but then
    again, no-one made promises." With almost thirty uXu files out there,
    it was time to organize the distribution of these files, and the search
    for good distribution sites, as well as sites where forthcoming
    contributors could leave their submissions to uXu (making life a bit
    easier for them, not having to call Sweden) was started. Three major,
    and also well-known U.S. boards answered that they'd be happy to store
    the uXu files. (Demon Roach Underground, Condemned Reality and Ripco ][)
    That was what made uXu available and known to a lot more people than
    before. "We really can't thank the SysOps of these boards enough for
    their help."


    December saw the last 1991 uXu release and yet another member was added
    to the list of writers, Mister Monochrome, who became the first U.S. uXu
    writer. Mister Monochrome, sadly enough, wrote only one file for uXu, but
    also made it clear to others that uXu accepted foreign writers. The
    release also contained files from The GNN and The Chief. The Chief's
    major file for this release was a follow-up to the Ripco BBS case, as
    you doubtfully have heard of if you haven't been hacking the last few
    years <g>. Dr. Ripco himself helped creating the follow-up, adding
    information and gave uXu a clear signal to publish an interview they'd
    made with him. This file contained every piece of information found
    about the incident, and the aftermath (?). Most of it was taken from
    the Computer Underground Digest (CuD), which, even today, is the best
    source of information regarding the computer underground you can find.
    "...we must thank the Editors, Jim Thomas and Gordon Meyer for their
    great work!"


    January 1992. The Chief had been drafted to do his military service,
    and went to do so on the 7th of January. The idea was that he would
    be gone for almost a year, so Phearless took charge and became the
    editor, distributor and contact for uXu. As most of the releases from
    uXu were dominated by files from The Chief, the general thought was
    that this would be the end of the group. But.. The fourth release was
    packed with files from Phearless and The GNN. Even The Chief got some
    time off to do the index. Mister Monochrome was moved to the Contributor
    Member List.


    When March arrives, The Chief had injured himself and was spending more
    time at home than at the military base, waiting to be dismissed and
    relieved from his duties. The fifth release was distributed at the
    beginning of the month with files from The GNN and The Chief. This
    release marks the beginning of The GNN's fiction frenzy, and also
    where The GNN's production of files passes The Chief's. If you haven't
    read the files from this release, you've missed the truly Best from
    The GNN. Also with this release, an initiation of a competition called
    'The Textfile Writer's Awards' is launched. Unfortunately it seems like
    the underground textfile public as well as the writers aren't too
    interested in such a competition, because the only response received
    was a basic warez-d00d comment: "what can u win???". The idea isn't
    bad, but if there's no indication of interest, why bother?


    The 6th set of files were released when April tumbled down on us. Two
    new contributors were added (Quiksilver from the U.S. and Ralph 124C41+
    from Sweden) with new specialities. "We were also happy to add a support
    and distribution site (Solsbury Hill) to our list, and once again be
    available to more people out there." A new section was added to the
    index with Thanks to those who had helped uXu in one way or another.
    Among the first listed we find Dr. Ripco, MAC???, Sarlo and Tequila
    Willy. New files from The GNN, The Chief, Quiksilver and Ralph 124C41+
    mashed this release into a great mix.


    One month later, the seventh release is out. Right before the summer
    holidays it crashed down upon an unsuspecting audience. The first
    Danish uXu support board was added with hopes of new members from
    Europe, and yet again a wider audience. Only the original members,
    The GNN, The Chief and Phearless added to the growing range of uXu-
    files this time. The first attempt to bring uXu onto the Internet
    was made, first by simply sending the files to ftp.uu.net, who kept
    them for a week, and then deleted them. Secondly, ftp.eff.org, who
    stated that "they already had similar files at their site". Today,
    the uXu files will probably be added to ftp.lysator.liu.se, but
    nothing has been decided yet, so stay tuned for confirmation before
    crashing down on the site.


    Release number eight in July contained material from all listed
    uXu members, which is a 'first' for the group. Adding yet another
    contributor (Sarlo) to the member-list along with three really great
    files from the same (get them now if you haven't already). Also a
    'first' for the series is a co-production between Phearless and
    The GNN which is highly recommended. As stated above, files from
    The GNN, The Chief, Phearless, Ralph 124C41+ and Sarlo made this
    release one of the best to this date.



    Which leads us to...

    Release number nine. December 1992. The moon is in orbit. (no shit!)
    Almost four months after release 8, the ninth release comes as a
    christmas holiday special with a new set of files to break the magic
    '100' (This very file even!). The Chief went back to do some studying
    that meant less files from him (time is grades) and a big gap between
    this release and the previous one. New files from Phearless and The
    GNN, who once again 'saved the day' (and the release). Subscriptions
    to uXu is now available through the Internet (E-Mail The Chief at
    chief@lysator.liu.se) as well as back issues. An anonymous ftp site
    for the uXu files will soon be reality, but the contact with BBS's
    has taken a blow due to non-existent money for calls. Releases will
    probably only be sent through the Internet and be available from
    the uXu homeboard 'The Stash' from release 10. Nothing is decided
    yet though.


    A great year with uXu and a great set of over 100 files makes the
    difference between failure and not completely failure <g>. No, this
    isn't going to be some self-admiration-history-of-uXu-kind-a-stuff
    that you all expect. We here at uXu are damn proud to have an
    audience out there who collects and read our files. We're just as
    surprised as you that we broke the magic 100.

    We do have a few surprises up our sleeves, and that's why we have
    targeted 1993 as our main year of existence. Watch out, here we come!


                                           The uXu staff of writers

                The Chief, The GNN, Phearless, Ralph 124C41+, Sarlo
