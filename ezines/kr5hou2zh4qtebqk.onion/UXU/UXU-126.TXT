                                   WHY?
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
 
                  "Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist."
                           (Ludwig Wittgenstein - Tractatus)
 
  Why  do I drink, smoke and have sex without any protection?  When I drive
a car, I do not use any safety belt.
  Why?
  Because I want to die.
  We  all  want to live, because we want to die.  Life is a short period on
planet  Earth, it plays around with us for a while, then it throws us away,
like trash being thrown into a garbage can.
  But then, why do we care to live?  Because we want to be remembered, live
forever.   We  cannot live forever as a body, so we must leave something to
the people after us.  We want to live forever, in their minds.
  To  live  forever  is  hard.   To  be seen, heard and noticed is the most
important  part of our lives.  Work!  Be something!  Do something with your
life!  Spend your doomed period working!  Work!  Work!
  Who  made  these rules that holds us in a steady grip?  The people before
us  made  them.   They had a life, a short life, and that life must be made
important  to  them.   If it had been a complete waste, then their life had
been  without meaning.  A fart in the hard wind.  Nobody wants to see their
neighbor  succeed,  and our parents do not want us to succeed.  To succeed,
is  to  discover the truth.  To discover the truth is to discover that life
is  wonderful.   If  we  discover  that life is wonderful, we stop thinking
about  work.  Work!  If we succeed, we will run away from the path that our
parents have shown us, the same path that they walked on.  This is the same
path that THEIR parents walked on.
  Stay  on  the  path!  Do not leave it!  If you do, you will make our life
look meaningless!  Stay!  Be as everybody else!
  The twisted "facts" from the past is always presented to us.
  But  do  succeed!  Do not listen to the old facts!  They are wrong.  What
do you want to do with your life?  Do you  want to work and then die?  Fine
with  me, just to it.  But if you want to paint, write or do drugs, then do
it.   You are the ultimate judge of your own life, so do not listen to what
everybody else say.  They are wrong.

           "Do what thout wilt, shall be the whole of the law."
                         (Aliester Crowley - Book of the law)

  You  will  die.   I  will  die.   Sooner or later.  Maybe tomorrow, maybe
never.   If  you want to live forever, you must leave something to the next
generation.   The  best  thing  to  give them, is the open road without any
obstacles.
  Once I said to a friend of mine that I want to be free.  He asked me what
I  meant.   Freedom,  I said.  I mean, pure freedom!  He did not understand
what  I  really  meant.   He claimed to be free.  He was free to choose any
education he wanted, he was free to work.
  Is that freedom?  I asked.  Yes, he said.  I am free, because I live in a
free society.
  Then  feel  free.   I  do  not feel free.  The ultimate freedom is not to
listen  to  the  crowd.  The crowd have certain rules of what is right, and
what  is wrong to do.  It is wrong to not get a good education and then get
a  well-paid job.  Freedom, is to work.  The crowd have always said so, and
will forever.
  Fuck  you, who look down on those who do what they want to do!  Fuck you!
Fuck  all  well-dressed  politicians,  crazed  priests  and "well-educated"
selfish money-loving jerks!  Even if your dick is to small and you have the
urge  to  be  heard,  remember  that  you  are  hated  by  a small group of
individuals  who know what knowledge really if!  Knowledge is not to repeat
parts of the old song, knowledge is to write yet another song!
  Fuck you, who try to stop people singing their own song.
  Stay  out  of the crowd.  Do not run with the pack and follow the leader.
The  leader  has  been  educated  by  old facts, that have been made by the
people before us, to make their lives look important.
                                                                         
                    "Tell us what to do!  FUCK YOU!"
                                (Ice-T/Body Count)

  Do  not  listen to me.  I am not a part of the crowd, but you know better
than me about yourself.
  However,  never  ever try to tell me what I am supposed to do.  If you do
that, you are a part of the crowd.  The sick crowd.
  Why  do  I write?  To live forever maybe, but mostly to leave messages to
the next generation.
  (Those who leave messages are wrong!  the crowd shouts.  They are madmen,
terrorists and mentally disturbed!  They stand out of the crowd!  Grab them
and hold them while we tell them what to do!  Quick!  Quick!  Someone might
listen to them!)
  Will my messages live forever?
  I do not know - I can only hope!
  Hope is the force that keeps us going.

  To avoid death, is impossible.
  Die with a pride over your life.
  Do not listen to the crowd.
  Everything goes!
