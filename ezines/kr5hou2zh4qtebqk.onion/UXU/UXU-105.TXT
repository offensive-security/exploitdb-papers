*   The intro.

    Rumors said we were dead-n-gone. Not true! Here we are, back with
    yet another release full of goodies and just in time for the X-Mas
    holidays too. We won't apologize that we're a bit late, because
    we're never late! We don't have a release schedule as you know.
    Well, the index is as always packed with new information, about
    the new files as well as other various thingies, so get on with
    the reading, and we'll do the writing <g>.


*   Just a few notes on this release.

    The writers for this release include The GNN, Phearless and The Chief.
    The contents of the files varies as always, but keeps the standard
    high quality, leaving no clues to whatever they're really about.


*   uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?

    The plans for an anonymous ftp-site continues. We're a lot closer
    getting one now, and hopefully, we can direct you to one in the next
    release. In the meantime, if you have an Internet address, you can
    subscribe to uXu (or request back-issues) by E-Mailing The Chief at
    chief@lysator.liu.se. If requesting back-issues, please list the
    number(s) of the issue(s) instead of title(s). To subscribe, just let
    the Subject line of the letter contain the words "Add uXu", and every
    new release will be mailed to you as soon as it is ready for release.
    Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it is now
    necessary due to reasons we can not yet reveal. Please read through
    the small but informative notice at the end of this textfile and
    believe us when we tell you that it had to be done.


    Easier way to find the new stuff.

    We have added yet another feature to the Index files, and I guess
    you already have noticed what it is. Yes, it's the (*) at the far
    left-side. The (*) marks what's new since the last index, so you
    won't have to search through the whole index for the latest info.


    uXu Annual Writer's Awards.

    We still want comments on the Annual Awards we suggested in the
    release before this one, but so far, the only comment has been
    (and I quote): "What can u win???". 

    I can't believe that we're only reaching eLiTe-d00dz with our files
    (regarding the only comment we got, what else can we think?). I hope,
    sincerely, that there's still people out there who enjoy reading
    text files, and consider them an asset in the modem world. People like
    me and the members of uXu. If not, who reads our files?

         Read uXu file #58 for complete information about the Awards.

                                 Merry X-Mas and have a great holiday!
                                                       The Chief / uXu

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor may download files.

July  December  July  December  July  December  July  Releases 1992:

095: "Feline Superiority" by The GNN.   People think they're so
bright, right? Someone (we all know who) told us that mice were
smarter than us, and we laughed at the thought. What would You
say if this was discovered to actually be the truth?

096: "The Family Man" by The GNN.   The dark future places its
cold hands around your neck. No-one is there to rescue you from
the eternal and punctual void, and the man asked you why? Why
did you cry for help? A dark story from The GNN to get you in
the mood for yet another uXu release.

097: "Criminal Me" by Phearless.   The confessions of a criminal?
Violence, drugs, theft, guns and other activities are listed on
this individuals record, which actually makes a great story. Is
he just plain crazy or does he live the normal healthy life you
expect him to do? You decide.

098: "Utopia" by The GNN.   If you're depressed, don't read this
excellent view on life as it is today by The GNN. You will not
find an utopia, you will only see the truth. If you're not afraid
of the truth, the beautiful, but at the same time ugly, truth
is here presented to you in a neatly coated file.

099: "Two Poems In One" by Phearless and The GNN.   Why bother
asking why? Almost a co-production again between our two masters
of anarchy and fiction, but not quite. Well, there's no need in
plugging for this one, because it'll be a hit anyway.

100: "A Year With uXu" by The Chief.   A brief look on the year that
has passed along with uXu releases. The short uXu history you might
call it. Seemed appropriate to write when the one hundredth file was
to be released.

101: "Sex!" by The GNN.   Not what you expect from the title, but
it does have to do with the content in a way. Sex sex sex, is that
ALL you think about? Good! Then this file is for you. Why not do
what everyone else is doing? This one will show you how!

102: "Meaning Of Life" by The GNN.   When you discover THE meaning
of life. When you know why you do the things you do, why the human
race behaves like it does, and why boiling tea is hot, what happens?
Will you go nuts when you discover the truth. Only the brave will
ever know..

103: "Vampires Anno 90's" by The GNN.   If Dracula decided to make
a comeback today, who would believe it? Would You listen if someone
tried to warn you? Here's the story about the Dracula of today.
The modern Dracula.

104: "Church Of The Re(A)listic" by The GNN.   A realistic church?
Get real! What has caused more war than anything else on this earth?
What has made people do crazy and often lethal things more than
anything else? You guessed it! But why, and what can we do about it?
Here's a thought.

105: "uXu Index #9" by The Chief.   Better late than never, right?
YES we do live! Rumors? All lies! It's not true! Not true I say! <g>.
As you might expect (expect?) you'll find the regular sections in
the index, with new information, generalabelia and of course, like
always the index contains:

          * An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          * Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          * An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List
          * An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          * All the new release files in Long format.
          * An updated list of boards where to contact uXu.
