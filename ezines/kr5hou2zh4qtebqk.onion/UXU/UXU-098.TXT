  ABOUT THE AUTHOR
 
  A cynic.
 
  PREFACE
 
  Dream: "Oops! I failed again!"
  Truth: "SHIT FUCKING SHIT HELL DAMN FUCK THIS DAMN SHIT!"
 
  "What happened?", you will ask yourself.
 
  INTRODUCTION TO THE UTOPIA
 
  The world is boring and telling truths about yourself to yourself is only
depressing.   But  is  it not incredible irritating to go out and have some
fun when you must be presented to Jerks all the time.  Bah!  People show up
at   the   local   pubs   or   bars   with   strange   cousins,   brothers,
friends-from-god-know-where  and  they  just HAVE to introduce them to you.
Yes, it is okay to say hello and then continue drinking that expensive beer
or  keep talking to that nice-looking girl.  BUT THAT IS NOT THE END OF IT!
These  Jerks just have to keep talking shit to you.  Even when you begin to
act  slightly  unfriendly  they keep staying.  How do you explain to a Jerk
that  he  is  a  Jerk?  So the nice night turns into yet another depressing
moment  in life when the Jerk need an explanation why you asked him to piss
off and get his ass to several places around the globe.
  So  you  get  another  reason to argue and it will eventually turn into a
fight  which  will end rather quick when some pseudo-saint fellow separates
you  from  the Jerk.  After screaming various nasty words to each other you
go  home to forget it all.  Next weekend it is all the same.  Why do people
keep asking about reasons to suicide?
 
  ABOUT ALCOHOL
 
  You  work  all day long and when you have a free moment you want orgasms.
But  of  course,  other people who want to feel that they are so incredible
intelligent will stop you.  They demand an end to the drinking and smoking.
If possible, they would probably stop sex too.  Do they really believe that
life  is so damn fun when constructing ovens eight hours a day that you can
forget all about it without alcohol?
 
  DEMOCRACY
 
  The  word "democracy" has been compared with god itself.  Everything that
is  good  is  "democracy".   Everything  bad  are places that does not have
"democracy".   WHAT  FUCKING  DEMOCRACY?   The  only thing you can do is to
choose  (haha)  between  different bad things.  All of them consists of mad
idiots who see themselves as Jesus Christ (with the exception that THEY can
crucify  whoever  or  whatever  they  want).   But if you discover that the
smiling  fag  you voted for last time turns out to be yet another child who
want  to show his pals in other countries that he has got the biggest toys,
then  what can you do?  NOTHING.  He will sit there until the time is ready
for  yet  another election.  A bunch of lies are presented to you again and
oops, he is there again.
 
  THEN WHAT?
 
  Ok, so you get a rather good life with many moments of joy and happiness.
Then what?  Do you honestly believe that it will end calm and peaceful?  No
way!   You  will  probably  die  in a very ridiculous way like swallowing a
tooth-pick at a cocktail party or fart by an open fire and explode.
 
  CHECK OF THE PRESENT SITUATION
 
  Let  us  say  that you manage to write interesting files and finally join
some  known  text file group.  It does not matter how good files you write,
sooner  or later another guy will join and produce one or two files.  After
that  he  will  tell  You how to write Your files or why not how to run the
entire group!
 
  EXAMPLE
 
  Let  me tell you a story from my own life (some people just love to write
files about themselves - but I try to avoid it (but in this case, it can be
quite  interesting)).   I was awaiting a rather large sending of guns to my
paintball  company from a salesman.  It was supposed to come to Sweden from
England  on  thursday  and  arrive  to  my  office the next day.  I was not
surprised  at  all  when the phone rang and I was informed that the sending
had  not  arrived.   Nobody  did  not  really  know why, but the company in
England claimed that they had sent everything in time.  Days passed and one
week  later  the sending finally arrived.  The delay had been caused due to
some idiot who imported marmalade.  Marmalade?  Yes, he had not bothered to
get  permission  to trade anything and the custom stopped everything in the
truck who carried a lot of things - including my stuff.  So, now finally my
stuff came over the border and it would be in my hands the next day.  I was
not at all surprised when the phone rang and I was informed that everything
had  been  stolen during the night.  Someone probably knew that the sending
had  arrived  and struck the company.  "Don't worry", the salesman told me.
"We  will  immediately call and ask for an emergency transport of new guns.
It  will  be  here in two days.  It will be on your desk by the end of this
week!".   I  sure  hoped  so,  because now it began to really burn under my
feet.   We  had  the  entire weekend fully booked and we must get the guns!
Friday  came,  and I was not at all surprised when I found no parcels in my
box.   I  called  the  salesman and asked him whatthehell had happened.  He
swore  on  his mothers grave that he had sent the stuff by express and that
it  must  be  at  some  mail terminal.  After dozens of calls I gave up.  I
could  not  trace it to any main terminal and the staff working there could
not find it.  Then the phone rang again.  It was the salesman again.
 "Eh,  well,  uh,  I  checked  again  and  it seems like it have been small
misunderstanding here...".
  "What?" I must admit that my voice sounded rather annoyed.
  "It has been sent by economy mail.  By mistake..."
 Economy mail takes three days.  I am still waiting for it.

  DEATH

  People see Death as the ultimate crime.  War is horrible and murder is so
incredible  bad,  bad,  bad.   So  what?  We are all going to die sooner or
later.   We are only a piece of dust in the eternal cosmos and planet Earth
will not stay forever.  It will die and disappear and no one will notice it
because  it  was only here for a brief moment of time, compared to the real
time found in space.

  THE KING IS DEAD

  Who is the king?  I do not know, but he is dead.  Long live the king.

  EVERYBODY

  People  need to make themselves more important than they are.  They enjoy
to  complain  and argue with other just to be seen.  The best thing you can
do  when  meeting such a person is to listen to his stream of crap and then
give him or her a good kick in the ass.  Then you have stated your opinion.
You  do  not  care  to even argue with the individual, you just kick.  That
should do it.  You do not waste time to tell the truth.

  SO-CALLED FRIENDS

  There is nothing called "real friends".  Note that I did not use the word
"nowadays",  since  it  has  never  ever  existed  any real friends through
history.   It  is  all  about  give  and take from each other.  If you have
nothing to offer your "friend" he/she will not be especially interested any
more.   Money,  sex,  laughs, things etc.  Give away to those who can offer
you something in return...  and when you are empty, bye bye...

  EPILOGUE

  "What happened", you will ask yourself.

  "Was is really life I just experienced?"

  "No, must have been a practical joke", you say and try to sleep again.
