                              "THE LOST SOUL"
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
 
                            This is a true story.


                Like an invisible flash of lightning,he tumbled
              towards  the stars.  He entered black holes, felt
              the  heat from distant suns and the cold from the
              deep  space.   Promixa  Centauri,  Sirius  or the
              North star.  It was all available for him as long
              as  he wanted.  He travelled faster than anything
              else, to places no one ever seen.  Space told him
              to explore the magic and the unknown.  He was the
              lost  soul, lost to the invisible and the silent.
              Why  he  was  doomed  to  this  lonely  life  was
              forgotten. It happened several thousands of years
              ago  and  it  is not easy to remember everything.
              Maybe  he  did not want to remember it and denied
              the  fact  that  he  would  be  completely  alone
              forever.   He  did  not feel alone, he felt free.
              Free,  to  do whatever came into his head without
              any comments from other people.  People.  Humans.
                Humans?   What  happened  to  the humans?  Or -
              much  better - what happened to his own race?  He
              had been gone too long...  He twisted, turned and
              rushed  past  shining stars towards the end.  But
              there was no end of the universe.  He would never
              find  any  brick  wall  at  the  end of the ride.
              Everything  is  eternal, even a lost soul.  There
              was  nothing more to explore in the static space.
              It was time to find his roots, time to go back.
                It  had  changed.  Still blue, but not the same
              Earth  he knew about.  He could not recognize his
              own  places  as  he  used  to do.  Everything was
              harder.   Cold.   Black. There were a lot more of
              them  now,  and  they  were  concentrated to more
              compact  areas of the big world.  Them.  He still
              called the humans "them".  He was one of them, to
              the mind but not to the body.  The difference was
              small.  He could think, he could believe.  But he
              could  not  trap his thoughts in a shell or dress
              them as a smile.  They floated away, like dust in
              a light breeze.
                Then  he  saw  her.  Something woke inside him.
              She   walked   in  the  darkness  of  the  night,
              completely  alone.   What  happened  to  him?  He
              wanted   to  leave,  to  run  away  and  continue
              laughing   at   the  misery  they  had  built  to
              themselves.   Something  stopped  him. Something.
              Tears fell from her eyes.  Before he knew, he was
              right in front of her.  The silence engulfed both
              of  them.   She  raised  her head and watched the
              stars.  Oh, he said, I can take you there.  I can
              show you all the places you dream about.
                You  are  a flower in the concrete.  You do not
              deserve   to   live  in  a  world  of  death  and
              destruction.  Let me take your hand.
                A  chilly  wind.   His  hand could not feel her
              soft  skin.  So close, but so far away.  He never
              wanted  to  leave  her.  The Universe was eternal
              but  had  no  true  love to offer.  The only true
              love  existed  on  a  planet  that  was a pile of
              failure.  It did not matter to him any more.
                She  smiled.   Someone  else  was  there.   She
              looked  right  into  his  eyes, but could not see
              him.   She  saw  someone  else.   An explosion of
              remembrance and memories crashed into him.
                Why
                Cannot be
                is it
                But
                Away,  away.   He  ran away once again.  It was
              perfectly  clear  to  him,  almost  when  he  had
              forgotten  all  about it.  He was a lost soul, he
              could  dream  and  wish but nothing else.  No one
              would ever notice him.
                Like  a  clown  in  circus.   He fills you with
              laughter and joy.  Maybe you  wonder how it would
              be to act as a clown. 
                Never, you ask yourself who the  clown in front 
              of you  is.
