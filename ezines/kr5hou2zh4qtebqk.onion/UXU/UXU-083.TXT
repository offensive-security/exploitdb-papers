    We're here for those of you wanting something fun, exiting and cool
    to read during your summer holidays. I bet most of you are on your
    way to proms and other parties now, but after those, you'll have a
    whole summer to look forward to, with files from uXu, a beer and
    a place under a palm-tree, you're in paradise <grin>. There is a
    small possibility that the next uXu release won't come out until
    August, because of the pending summer and you know.. people travel,
    they have some outdoor life, and there's tons of girls on the beach
    and tunes from the bands, but we hope that you'll forgive us, and
    we'll have a bunch of new files coming your way in August instead.

    We still want comments on the Annual Awards we suggested in the
    release before this one, but so far, the only comment has been
    (and I quote): "What can u win???". 

    I can't believe that we're only reaching eLiTe-d00dz with our files
    (regarding the only comment we got, what else can we think?). I hope,
    sincerely, that there's still people out there who enjoy reading
    textfiles, and consider them an asset in the modem world. People like
    me and the members of uXu. If not, who reads our files?

         Read uXu file #58 for complete information about the Awards.

                                                       Happy Holidays!
                                                       The Chief / uXu


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file and E-Mail
   The Chief for further information (if needed) or to let us know you'd
   like to join. Don't hesitate! Call today!


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor may download files.

April  May  April  May  April  May  April  May  April  May Releases 1992:

073: "Electricity" by The GNN.   What would you do without it?
Think about it for a second. Nothing that runs on electricity
could be used. A scary thought, presented by The GNN.

074: "The European Digest Vol.2 Issue #02" by The Chief.   Hi there!
We're back with yet another Digest. This issue starts a new series
with Digital's VMS Version 5. Plus the regular sections, recommended,
end comments and lists of places where you can find uXu.

075: "Toy Soldiers" by The GNN.   Technology takes over? You're
scared of the diseases we have around us these days? Ecological
disasters? Well, you could end your days in other ways. Neat
fiction from our meister, The GNN.

076: "The Non-Fictionous 'Over The Edge'" by Phearless.   Story
about one day in one of our contributors' life. It isn't dull,
and it isn't boring. Action, police cars and Machine guns are
just a few ingredients.

077: "The Lost Soul" by The GNN.   When you die, where do you go?
Are you going to heaven or hell? Will your soul move on to another
body, or are you just plain dead and gone? Another fiction story
from The GNN.

078: "How To Get...Older Women Part II" by The Chief.   Seriously?
Yes, it's the second part of this tutorial. The first part came
with our very first release, but we haven't forgotten that we 
promised a sequel. This one covers Younger Women, how strange this
may sound to you reflecting on the title.

079: "Smog's Revenge" by The GNN.   It's The GNN's masterpiece.
It's the longest story ever to be published from our meister, and
it will take you through every place in the galaxy. This is what
we've all been waiting for. You'll be sorry if you miss it!

080: "The European Digest Vol.2 Issue #03" by The Chief.   Sure is.
Another Digest in the very same release. This is the continuing
Xenix tutorial, ending Chapter 4 started in Issue #01. Recommended,
End Comments and the list of places where to find uXu are included
as usual.

081: "Laser Human Terrorism" by The GNN.   You can have unbelievable
fun with a lasersight! You don't need a gun to scare people. Just
buy yourself a lasersight, and get this file with tips and trix on
how to have so much fun with it, you'll be laughing for days.

082: "The Cure for Paranoia" by The GNN.   Are you paranoid? Maybe
you should be, reading these uXu files <grin>, but if you are, The
GNN presents a few solutions to your problem in this file. Recommended
for those who are wanted by the police.

083: "uXu Index #7" by The Chief.   Of course we're releasing the 7th
Index with release No.7. What did you think? :) If you're one of our
fans (grin) you already know about the contents of our index files,
but here it is, once again for new readers, the Index contains;

          * An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          * Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          * An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List
          * An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
