*   The intro.

    Not quite as promised, but close enough, we're out with the 8th
    release. There will be yet another gap between release 8 and 9 due
    to me moving, and getting back to school this autumn, but I hope it
    will not affect my own writing as it have for this release. Summer
    have placed itself in front of my authoristic lifestyle, but I guess
    that's only natural. With temperatures as high as 40 degrees celsius,
    it's not a very productive temperature.


*   Just a few notes on this release.

    We're adding a new contributor to the list of authors, and it's
    Sarlo, from the U.S. We haven't received any submissions from our
    other contributors for a while, but Sarlo helps us overcome that
    loss with a couple of great files. You're a fool if you miss 'em.
    Only one file from me (The Chief) this time except for the Index,
    but I have explained all that above. GNN & Phearless handed us their
    first joint effort, which leaves me with a taste for more at least,
    and we have Ralph 124C41+ with some interesting ones again.


*   uXu, through Anonymous ftp?

    Oh yeah, you were able to get all uXu files from ftp.uu.net for a
    week or two, before they erased our files. Seems like they didn't
    want to store them there, but we will not give up, and are currently
    having some discussions with other ftp-sites. Stay tuned.


*   uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it is now
    necessary due to reasons we can not yet reveal. Please read through
    the small but informative notice at the end of this textfile and
    believe us when we tell you that it had to be done.


*   New Easier way to find the new stuff.

    We have added yet another feature to the Index files, and I guess
    you already have noticed what it is. Yes, it's the (*) at the far
    left-side. The (*) marks what's new since the last index, so you
    won't have to search through the whole index for the latest info.


    uXu Annual Writer's Awards.

    We still want comments on the Annual Awards we suggested in the
    release before this one, but so far, the only comment has been
    (and I quote): "What can u win???". 

    I can't believe that we're only reaching eLiTe-d00dz with our files
    (regarding the only comment we got, what else can we think?). I hope,
    sincerely, that there's still people out there who enjoy reading
    textfiles, and consider them an asset in the modem world. People like
    me and the members of uXu. If not, who reads our files?

         Read uXu file #58 for complete information about the Awards.

                             (it's only a lame handle for eLiTe-d00dz)
                                                       The Chief / uXu

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor may download files.

June  July  June  July  June  July  June  July  June  July Releases 1992:

084: "10th Generation" by The GNN.   People get killed you know!
90% of all accidents occur at home according to the statistics.
What does this have to do with this textfile? Ehrm, well, it's
a mystical 'detective' story, set in the future with the class of
GNN, and GNN only.

085: "H0w t0 fix ur kredit!" by Sarlo.   The file that transformed
me into a mass of laughing material. Sarlo teaches you the eLyTE
way to 'fix ur kredit'. This file must only be read by eLyTe-d00dz
to be comprehended! Surgeons Warning! (He'll have to operate to
get the laughter away!). Truly already a classic.

086: "Headhunter" by The GNN.   The scene is the future. People
never go into battle themselves, they use robots. Here we meet
someone with a mission. A mission to find the Man, and nothing
is to stand between him and his mission. But why? Who IS the Man?
Is it the ghost of James Brown coming back to haunt you? You'll
see... (quote).

087: "How to annoy an enemy (or make a new one)" by Ralph 124C41+.
You ever been so angry at someone, you didn't know WHAT to do?
This excellent textfile will get you on your way with some perfect
hints and tips, just to make the life of your enemy a bit tougher.
This one'll kick the other 'annoy' files out there off the market.

088: "Backfire" by The GNN and Phearless.   Why, it's our first
co-production from two of our writers! And it's a helluva story.
Did you ever wonder how you got into That system so easily? Some
systems you hack looks just like they're standing there, waiting
for you don't they? Well, they could be there for a reason...
Hackers watch out!

089: "The Ivan Chronicles - Downtown Julie Brown Spills Her Guts"
by Sarlo.   Sarlo's second file for uXu, and it's our first gore-
thriller-suspense-humorous textfile. Why, aren't you all just too
sick of 'Downtown Julie Brown'? Why doesn't anyone DO ANYTHING
about it!? Well, someone might...

090: "People of the Elite Scene - Yargh!" by The GNN.   I know you
want just to Know who all those people calling your board, chatting
with you somewhere, or meet in the street (rarely) really are, and
that's the reason I'll let you in on a small secret. Shhhh! (get
this file and you'll be able to recognize those dumb suckers). The
GNN at his peak of performance.

091: "Clean Shaven Beauty" by Ralph 124C41+.   Ralph lets you in on
one of his secrets in this small but informative file. Did you ever
think how it would feel to shave 'there'? Well, you're in for a 
surprise, let me tell you.

092: "Blackstone Rising" by Sarlo.   Do you believe in God? Do you
think Satan is the root of all evil? How can you be that sure?
Sarlo lets you meet Blackstone, a.k.a Satan in a close-up, deep-
diving and informative 'interview'. Maybe, everything's the other
way around?

093: "Meanwhile" by The GNN.   Another story from The GNN? Well,
I think you'll find this one different. Really. I will not reveal
what lurks inside this textfile, you will have to find that out
by yourselves.

094: "uXu Index #8" by The Chief.   A bit earlier than planned, but
still we're here. Some new sections added again, which hopefully
will improve the index. We evolve as you read (grin).
The Index contains;

          * An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          * Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          * An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List
