                            SUCKER! HA HA HAAA!


  It  was Christmas  evening.  Pete was desperately trying to find his dads
cars  keys,  which  was  obviously  hidden somewhere in the house.  His dad
hated him for borrowing the car without asking.  Pete had looked everywhere
and  now  he had even crawled under his parents bed to look.  The keys were
not there.  A lot of dust entered his already cocaine-stuffed nose.
  - Shit!
  He slammed the door to his parents bedroom shut and went downstairs.  His
mother  stood  by this years most distastefully decorated Christmas tree in
the  kitchen  and  looked  depressed.  She had a cigarette in her mouth and
tried  hard  to  light it with a blow torch, the only gift she had received
during  the evening (except for the pornographic video 'Black Butt Busters'
("You need education my dear"))
  - Where is dad?  Pete asked and looked around in paranoia.
  - Here, his mother answered without a sign of feelings.
  -  Here?   I  cannot  see him?  Is he in the living room?  I guess I will
have to go there and...
  His mother pointed at the tree.
  - He is there.
  - In the tree?!
  Pete  wondered  for  a  short moment if his mother had stolen some of his
magic mushrooms.
  - No, under it.
  She  was  right.   His father lay  under the tree, puking and coughing, a
result after too much champagne and cigars.
  Pete bent down.
  - Eh...  dad?
  - Grumble...  hick...  cough.
  - Dad, where are the car keys?
  - A thief!  Hick!  My car!  A thief!  Die!
  His father quickly stumbled to his feet and ran to the living room, where
he  grabbed  a  unopened  gift.   He  quickly  teared the package apart and
grabbed  the  shotgun  that  was  inside  it.   ("I  bought it for personal
defense").
  - Dad!  Wait!  It is me!
  - Thief!  My car!  Intruder!  Die!
  Pete froze  when his father aimed the gun at him.  It was not everyday he
stared  into the barrel of a twelve gauge.  Well, it happened now and then,
but  Pete  had  really  excluded  Christmas  eve  as  a night for violence.
Especially from his father.
  - Dad!  It is me!  You son!
  - Who cares?  Merry Christmas and a happy new year!
  Pete's father  pulled the trigger.  Brain, blood and various other bodily
objects spread all over the kitchen.
  - You have just shot your son, said Pete's mother.
  - Urp...  well, you wanted him to move to another place.  Now he can move
to  heaven  and  spend  the  rest of Christmas  with Jesus.  They can dance
around...   hick...  the tree.  Pete, Jesus and God.  He will have more fun
than we will ever have down here.
  - I am so glad.  You are a genius.
  Pete's  mother  sounded  quite  ironic.  They  looked  at each other with
neutral  faces.   Pete's  father placed the shot gun on the Christmas table
and looked at his dead son.
  - I am so sorry...  please forgive me.
  He kneeled in front of Pete's mother.
  -  Please  forgive  me...   what have I done?  Blood everywhere!  This is
horrible, I have ruined your three days of cleaning!
  - Oh, that is nothing to worry about.  Come on, give me a hug and we will
forget all about it.
  She  grabbed  Pete's  father  and pulled him up. She laid her arms around
him.  A loud shot was heard.  BOOM.
  - What the...
  Pete's father fell to the floor and landed on top of Pete. Blood squirted
from the stomach.
  - Urgel...  hick...
  - Goddamn!  You stupid piece of man!  Why do you carry your revolver in a
shoulder holster on Christmas eve?
  - Cough...  personal defense...

                         How to succeed in life. 
  
                     1.  Help fools to get rid of their money.
                     2.  Blame the victim.
                     3.  Tease adult men who weeps.

*BREAK*


  Pete's father died.  He looked quite annoyed when he, a couple of minutes
later,  was  forced to dance with his son and Jesus and God around the tree
in paradise.  God just kept on singing shitty songs like "Jingle Bells" and
"Silent  night, holy night".  On top of everything, God had dressed himself
as Santa Claus.   Pete's father wondered if Nietzsche was around.  He would
probably pay good money for the extermination of God.
  - I should have bought a pistol instead, Pete's father mumbled.
  God  immediately  stopped  to dance.  Jesus however continued and did not
stop  until he  crashed into Pete's wide open gun shot hole.  God stared at
Pete's father.
  - WHAT?  Do you own a fu...  a GUN?  God screamed while hiding his divine
Maschinenpistolen A4 ("A small bribe from Hitler") behind  his divine back.
  - Of course, Pete's father answered. To kill intruders.  Communists.  Are
you a communist?  You wear red clothes.  I see you have a beard.  Like Karl
Marx.
  God was in a rage.  His face turned jolly red.
  - You motherfu...  GET OUT!
  - With pleasure.  Where is the divine exit?
  God  fumbled  in  his pockets.  After a while, he took up a divine remote
control  and  pressed a divine red button.  A divine trap door opened below
the  feets of Pete's father.  Satan laughed when yet another fool fell down
to his little charming amusement park.
  - Greeetings...  Satan whispered.
  Pete's father was not aware that he had been sent to hell.  He thought he
had, by some reason, been sent to some divine sauna.
  - Charming place!
  Pete's father placed a cigarette in his mouth.
  - Charming!  Have you got a lighter my friend?  he asked Satan.
  "He he", Satan thought. "More than enough".

  (Oh, fuck this story)

                                 THE END.


*BREAK*

                      How to really succeed in life.

                   1.  Make jokes at funerals.
                   2.  Steal from your friends.
                   3.  Laugh at people who are newly married.
