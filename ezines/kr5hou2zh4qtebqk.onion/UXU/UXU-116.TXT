*   The intro.

    The 10th release starts yet another year, with yet another load of
    new groups, new files and new news. But uXu will always be there,
    no matter what happens. We won't mutate into some virii, pirate,
    or 1980-textfile-copier, as we have seen happen to other groups
    and series, sadly enough. No Sir. We'll stay weird alright, gone,
    yeah, anarchistic, ok. You want a toaster too? You can't have one.

                                      Let's make 1993 a good one, ok?

*   Just a few notes on this release.

    The writers for this release include The GNN, Phearless, The Chief
    and Ralph 124C41+. Take it easy, take it easy, we're not heading
    towards a lyrics-transcribing group, although we have a few in
    this release. It was just needed. That's all. The rest of the files
    are mixed and well served with sugar as always.

    A couple of things delayed this release. A few weeks ago, just when the
    index was ready, everything on the way out, we received a submission
    on one of our Inlet Sites. It doesn't really matter what it contained,
    because we have promised to publish Everything except eLyTE-d00d stuff.
    But the contents of this file made us reconsider that promise. After
    a week of discussions, we decided to add yet another subject we won't
    publish. Some of you may feel that this is censorship, but when the
    rest of the CU seem to transform slowly, but definitely into covering
    Pirate stuff and Virus/Trojan information/creation, we decided we
    wouldn't. You won't find that kind of information under the uXu label.

    Secondly, we finally got our own ftp-able site. Check below for
    more information.


*   uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?

    Yes. We now have both.

    All issues (0-###) are available from  [ftp.lysator.liu.se] in the
    directory /pub/texts/uxu. This is where new uXu issues will be placed
    after the people on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing The Chief at chief@lysator.liu.se. If
    requesting back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Ex:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 003,022,054,065,023

    To subscribe, just let the Subject line of the letter contain the words
    "Add uXu", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon as it is
    ready for release. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. Where's the respect these days?


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are (*)-marks that
    let you know what's new since the last index. You won't have to
    search through the whole index for the latest info, just scan the
    file for the (*)'s.


*   uXu Annual Writer's Awards.

    Last call for the uXu Annual Writer's Awards.
    Unless we get some response about this initiative, we're going
    to place the whole idea in the round archive.

    Read uXu file #58 for complete information about the Awards,
    and LET US KNOW what you think!

                                                       The Chief / uXu

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.

December  March  December  March  December  March  Releases 1993:

106: "What Do You Think About Bleed?" by The GNN.   People seem
to criticize good, well-written up-your-face games these days.
How dumb! Don't you think? Yeah, so read what Brad Nixon NYPD
has to say to the non-believers, right here!

107: "uXu Lyrics: Curve - Doppleg„nger" by The Chief.   The Chief's
absolute favorites. Here with the lyrics to their latest album
'Doppleg„nger'. If you haven't heard of Curve, you haven't
experienced life!

108: "Dental Torture" by The GNN.   Shame on you! Afraid of
going to the dentist? Ha! Ehm.. Well.. dentalphobia could
happen to anyone. The GNN lets you know what a nightmare
a visit to the dentists could be.

109: "Clean Shaven Beauty II" by Ralph 124C41+.   If you could
write a sequel to what has been labeled 'un-sequelable', you
know what to expect. Yet another classic, mind-bending short
story by Ralph.

110: "The Civilized Primitive Prowler" by The GNN.   A schizophrenic
story by The GNN to complete this set of files, and give you
the maximum joy. I won't say anything about the contents,
because this is a file NOT TO BE MISSED. Another GNN Classic.

111: "Now It Can Be Told - uXu Members Speaks Out" by ALL.   Last
release, you were presented with a short tale about the year
uXu has been active by The Chief. Now the other members speaks
out, letting you know their side of the story. Uncensored
of course.

112: "uXu Lyrics: Curve - Pubic Fruit" by The Chief.   Now, if
you STILL haven't heard of Curve, you didn't read some of the
last file-descriptions! So, go back, and read it through, again
and again until.. Seriously, this is the lyrics to the compilation
Curve released at the end of 1992. Just unsinkable!

113: "uXu Lyrics: Slowdive - Just For a Day" by The Chief.   Yes,
it's another lyrics file. (There are a few this time aren't there?)
Slowdive lyrics, here from their 'Just For a Day' album released
last year. Another Chief favorite.

114: "Elite Modemtraders" by The GNN.   If you collect all eLyTE
modemtraders in a house, blow it up, and jump on the pieces,
would they disappear? Yeah, of course. They're too gullible
to even suspect someone tricking them. Check what The GNN did
to 'em.

115: "Castle Chronicles The Sequel - Chapter One" by The Chief.   
The sequel? But the first series isn't finished yet!? You're
right. This is the serious series with Castle set in a future
no one could imagine. The Non-humor-series. Read the end-comment
in file 115 to get the complete explanation.

116: "uXu Index #10" by The Chief.   I don't think you need an
introduction to the Index-file anymore. Or do you? Perhaps we have
a couple of new readers, perhaps someone actually enjoy reading
about the index in the index itself? Hmm.. ok then.. back to normal.
As you might know, you'll find the regular sections in the index,
with new information, general statistics and of course, the index
contains:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - All the new release files in Long format.
          - An updated list of boards where to contact uXu.

      [#116 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
