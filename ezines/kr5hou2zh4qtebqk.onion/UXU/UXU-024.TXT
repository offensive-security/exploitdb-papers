Hi there... Your first question may be something like; "what the hell is
the big difference of Chaos and Panic??" (referring to my last file). Well
dudes, I think there's a slight difference. Chaos doesn't *have* to mean
that people are panicking, and that's what I'll write about in this file.

There can be pretty good chaos anyway. And instead of a scene where people
are running for their lives, they will perhaps just not be aware of what
they're doing.



                                   DRUGS


The best way to make people act funny is to make them take some psychedelic
substances. The best way to do this should be to put drugs in food containers
(at restaurants, schools etc) where a lot of people take their food. One
way is to sprinkle your prepared liquid on some salad, in the coffee pot or
similar. Or walk around in the supermarket with a filled up syringe and
inject the shit in everything you see (apples, grapes(!), melons...). Just be
sure to "infect" ALL the apples or ALL the melons... so no one gets away.

One little detail, also be sure *not* to be caught... or you'll be in deep
shit. If you haven't figured it out, this is baaad in the eyes of a judge.
Anyway, when you see headlines like "50 naked people arrested in front of
the police station, police says they were all affected from narcotics", you'll
know you've succeed.



                                    GAS


Another, a lot more easier way is to get to people breathe in some funny shit
instead... This is the best way I think! Just take your newly bought (*cough*)
tube of laughing gas (with a proper "head", it'll make things a lot more
comfortable when turning on the gas). Anyway, the best way to make this an
effective way is to place the (opened) tube at some strategic place.

Try to find where the house (if that's the target for tonight) gets it's
fresh air "sucked in", some houses have it on their roofs, and some on
the (back side) wall, every house has got one though, if you want to,
you'll find one. To not waste to much gas cover the whole hole with a plastic
bag, and insert the head of the gas tube, make it look like this:

Now, you might find/have a tube that doesn't allow you to let the gas pour
out all-the-time, it's very easy to fix this, but I'll explain a way of
doing it, just in case you're intoxicated when you read this or just dumb...

Anyway, hammer a nail into the little "crack" where the little pin/hole is,
hammer until you hear a loud shhhhh-ing noise, and make sure the nail stays
where it is... if it doesn't, tape the nail to the tube (or why not super
glue!). The gas itself isn't dangerous if you're outdoors and it gets
mixed with a lot of air. It is only dangerous if you should inhale the gas
and not get enough oxygen... (yes, your brain is quite grateful for any oxygen
it can get, and it doesn't appreciate temporary loss of it).

I know what you all mad brains think right now; "hey, cool way of robbing
a bank or something!"... and yeah... it is, but they still got cameras you
know. So be sure to bring your mask (so you don't forget it, hehehe).

Ok, what will happen now, you ask yourself... well, I think you can guess.
What happens when people are affected of laughing gas is that they will
start laughing, get the cramps and wont have the faintest idea of what they're
actually doing (pee in their pants, fall over into some fountain etc etc).



    Be sure to be out terrorizing your fellow citizen already tonight!
