   You're absolutely right if you're surprised we're out with yet another
   release. I am too, let me tell ya. I (The Chief) am doing my military
   service right now (in the Air Force) so I have very little time to 
   write files. (little time = non at all), so I handed over the editor-
   title to Phearless for the 1992 releases. As you might have noticed,
   most of the uXu files are written by me, so I thought that release #3
   would be the last one. Imagine my surprise when The GNN started to
   produce files like a major corporation, and Phearless coming up with
   three files for one release! Seems like we have a writer's gold mine
   right here, don't it? What can I say? Thanks guys, and keep up the good
   work!

   As I said, I'm pretty busy this year with the service and all, but I
   still get some time off to write a few files, like this index for 
   example. For release #5, I'll have a few files ready for y'all.

   Member-News: Big A is no longer a member of uXu. This is because he
                never wrote the files he promised us. Case closed.
 
                We haven't been able to get in touch with any foreign
                members/contributors which is sad, because we really
                want you guys to write for uXu. REMEMBER: If you want
                to contact uXu, Call:

                (U.S)  CONDEMNED REALITY (618/397-7702)
                (SWE)  INFO ADDICT       (+46-###-####)  (ONLY WEEKENDS!)
                (SWE)  INFORMATION NODE  (+46-586-43766) (24HRS)

                There you can write to PHEARLESS and ask about uXu.
                He's in charge while I'm away.

   What else? Well, we're trying to expand, as always, so if you're interested
   in writing (about ANYTHING), contact us if you want your files to be spread
   with the uXu logo to a wide range of countries (only Underground boards).
   We don't have any deadlines, rules, censorship or demands for our writers.
   We don't change anything you write. We only include the uXu logo to your
   file(s). For members, we are happy if you write a minimum of 2 files/release
   though (NOTE: that doesn't mean you Have to write 2 files/release). To
   become listed as a member or contributor, you have to have written a minimum
   of ONE file for uXu. Please state (when applying) which one you'd like to be
   listed as; Contributor or Member.

   Member -->  Like stated above, we're happy if you write a minimum of
               TWO files/release. You do have to write something for
               each release to be listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor may download files.

   Well, that's about it for this introduction. I hope you all have a
   great 1992. Now check out the new files!

December  January  December  January  December  January  Releases 1992:

037: "Anarchist Unite" by The GNN.   The history repeats itself, told
here by The GNN. A pessimistic view on the system and how to get rid
of it, in a poetical way.

038: "A Jolly Good Day In School" by The GNN.  Interesting story from
school by our productive member The GNN. What can you really do when
your teacher tells you that you're worthless? Study this.

039: "Depth Charge" by The GNN.   The basic bomb-maker's instruction
on how to make a depth charge in the easiest way possible. Everyone
can do this, so why not try?

040: "Depression" by The GNN.   Life can be easy, for some people.
For most though, it's hard and depressing, so here's something for
you all to be even more depressed by.. maybe you find that you're
not so depressed after all. The GNN, the depression meister.

041: "The Excuse" by The GNN.   What do those second grade home-made
terrorists say when something goes wrong? Do they admit that they
made a mistake, or what? Find out by reading this informative file.

042: "Childish Thoughts" by Phearless.   When you're young, you think
everything's so easy. "Not a problem" you say. Well, it's not that
easy when you find that you're not a kid anymore. But some of us have
decided to carry out our thoughts, no matter what.

043: "The Anatomy Of Hate" by The GNN.   How can you say that you
hate when you're not sure what it means to really hate something or
someone? The word "Hate" gets dissected in this neat file by The GNN.

044: "Golf Ball Enjoyment" by Phearless.   Yet another easy-to-make
terrorist thingie for the anarchist. You got someone you want to get
rid of? Well, check out this one from Phearless, our #1 contributor.

045: "Fun With Electricity" by Phearless.   Phearless is back once
again with some projects for the home-anarchist. In this one, he
gives you even more ways to get rid of people you don't like.

046: "Acid Human Terrorism" by The GNN.   The "bonus" file in our
fourth release. This is The best file on acid terrorism I have read
in a long time. The GNN gives you a whole bunch of neat ways to use
acids in your search for true anarchism.

047: "uXu Index #4" by The Chief.   The fourth index is ready and
kickin'. Yes, it's The Chief's only file for uXu for this release
and the reason why is explained in the introduction to this file.
The index includes all uXu releases in Short format, the new files
in the Long format, as well as an introduction by The Chief, member,
contributor and support board lists, and of course, an updated list
of boards where to contact us.


             [#47 also includes an Index for the uXu-S series]
