As he entered the arcade, he knew that this was something special. During
the last years, arcade games had only been dumb machines who did what
you told them to do when you pulled and pushed a joystick.
But this was different. This was new. Everybody knew that the Virtual
Reality thing that came twenty years ago was amazing but that was only
child's play. The new AI games was the future. As always, there had been
some hard criticism against the AI arcades and some people claimed that
they had been brain-washed while playing. "Bullshit", he thought.
Some people just can't stand new technology.

Everything was silent in the big room. Arcades used to be noisy places
with sounds screaming from every direction. But now it was only
chairs, with people sitting in them with a large helmet over their
heads. Their eyes were dead, you could look straight into them but
they wouldn't see you. They were at another place in their minds.
What happened in their brains was a secret. He found it rather nice
that no one could watch what he did when he played. It made him
feel free, and that was the purpose. He loved it. Everybody did.

He looked around in the silent black room. Only one chair with the sign
"World War I" was free. He walked to it and sat down in the comfortable
chair. A voice started immediately to talk to him from above his head,
where the helmet was placed. "Welcome to World War I. Please place the
helmet over your head and wait". He already knew what would happen.
He had played before. A few seconds passed and then "Welcome. The scanning
of your files shows that you are healthy enough to play". That was
something he didn't like. It used to say "completely healthy" but now
it said "healthy enough". Could be anything which made it say that,
from a small cold to cancer. Frustrating. "Your credit shows 10 ecu which
is enough for you to play for 20 minutes. Do you want to continue?"
It's strange how nice the voice gets when it talks about money he thought.
"Yes", he said with a low voice. He didn't have to say it, the machine knew
it already from the positive waves in his brain. 

He ran. The gun in his hand felt uncomfortable heavy. The ground was muddy
and it rained. Explosions and machine-gun fire was everywhere. Screams,
blood and death. The rain felt like stones from the black sky. His brown
uniform was wet. He had already killed many people when they attacked
the small camp. But the backup from the german army was tougher than they
ever could imagine. They must retreat.
He ran. Only one mile left, then he would be back in safety. 
He made it. He survived. Life went on. He fought a couple of years more
on the front and he survived every attack. More years passed.
After six years, the war was over. He could go home. 

<CLICK> "YOUR TIME IS UP!" <CLICK>

Light and a dizzy vision of himself sitting in the chair with
a hi-score table floating over his face. He looked around and watched
the big digital clock on the black wall beside him. Twenty minutes
had passed. But he had been gone for longer than that. "Damn!", he thought.
If he had got more credits on his account he could have fucked his AI
wife in the game and later been elected to a AI president. He knew
that because a friend of his had also played the game, but with more
credits. It wasn't so bad anyway. He had been in the war, and six years
was quite alright. "Ready?" a girl asked him who probably had waited
for a while. She looked quite irritated. It was normal that people
who just had left the AI game just sat and stared into the wall. They
had a whole life to remember and that was rather overwhelming. He
cleared his mind, looked at her, nodded and walked away. She sat down
and placed the helmet over her head. "Welcome...".

He felt quite relieved to hear some noise again. The street was as usual
packed with cars who made a terrible sound compared to the silence in
the arcade. His head was still a bit heavy from the WW1 experience
but it would go away after a few hours. This time he didn't take any
pills to forget all about it. He used to do that all the time when he first
started to play. The memories was too much for him to handle. But now
he just wanted to remember the shooting and explosions for a while.
They would go away and disappear after a few days anyway. He liked
the war games most of all. Many he knew only played "Life of..." games,
which were games where you could be just another human, living a
normal life. He didn't understand how people could play that kind of
games. No action, just being someone else. "I spent 300 ecu once and
lived a whole life in another town! It was great!", his girlfriend
once said. That hurt! He said that if she didn't like the life she had
with him, then she could go back and live her life in the arcade forever!
She tried to explain, but he didn't care to listen. 

A memory came back when he sat on the bus home. He had met a soldier in
the game who turned out to be a german spy. He had been in charge of
the execution. He chuckled and felt once again the good feeling of the
kill. It was a strange feeling to have absolutely no idea who you
really was in the game. But that was a part of it all. 
How could it be fun to live another life if you knew that you weren't
that person? It would loose the charm if you ran around with an axe in
ancient times, hunting trolls, knowing all the time that you are an
18-year old, living in the 20th century with no action at all.
How could you feel any pain if you knew it was faked? 
He got some sand in his eyes when the bus rumbled away and continued.
The sun shined on him. A short walk and then he was in front of his house.
A small string of smoke came from the chimney and floated away with the
light breeze. In the garden
