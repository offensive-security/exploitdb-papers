                             "THE FAMILY MAN"
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
 
 
                            I saw my neighbors
                          on the television today
                   screaming about a sniper in our block
 
 
  So  he  stared  into  the  wall and thought about nothing.  His cold eyes
seemed  to  examine  the concrete as if it contained something interesting.
In  his  head,  chaos  ruled supreme.  His mind was filled with thoughts he
never  had  believed  he  could make up.  It surprised him.  Maybe he was a
genius after all.
  Dare  dare dare devil what is inside your head?  Listen to what I have to
say, or after all do not let me interfere your private life.
  A voice spoke to him.  Comfortable.  It was not necessary to face anyone.
He just had to listen.  So he listened carefully.
  The  house  he  lived  in had lost its brown color to a grey one.  No one
lived  there  by  free  will,  "but in these days you have to take what you
get".   What  you get.  That was not very true, since no one ever had given
anything to him.  But in THESE DAYS what could you expect?
  A  scream  from the apartment above woke him up for a moment.  He watched
the  clock  on  the  wall.  It did not work.  Of course.  The time had been
fourteen minutes to twelve the last two years.
  Time.   The  end  of time.  When he discovered that he could not stop the
endless  wheel  of  time, it was too late.  Everything was gone - his work,
friends and his mind.  He would not miss it.
  He  moved  his  position  so  he  could  stare  out  the  window instead.
Concrete,  mud and garbage.  In the middle of it all, a few children played
with  a  ball.   Klang, klang, klang.  The ball left the hand of one of the
children  and bunched on a wrecked car.  He felt like grabbing the ball and
jump on it until it was broken.  Just to end the depressing sight.


                              I turned it off
                           finished my six-pack
                            and reloaded my M16


  What  happened?   Time  had  passed  so quickly.  The sun had disappeared
behind  the horizon of grey buildings.  He moved.  The TV presented him yet
to  another  game  show.  This time people had to get out of a car that was
dropped  into  a nine feet deep pool filled with water.  No one had made it
so  far  and  the audience screamed happily when a diver picked up the dead
body of a man.  No first prize for him this time.
  "A  good  boy".   Yeah, a real good boy.  That was him and his mother had
yet  defended  him from an angry father who accused him for stealing a bike
and  tried  to  kill his son with it.  Yes, he had stolen the ugly bike and
dropped  it from a roof onto the stupid kid who owned it.  They had to take
the  kid  to the hospital, but what did he care?  Give me proof, his mother
screamed  and  the  man  turned  around  and walked away.  Time flies.  His
mother was gone.  Where?  He did not know - it was a long time ago.
  Maybe she was in the closet.
  Listen listen listen my friend.  It's me again!  Remember?
  Yes - he sure remembered.  How could he ever forget that voice that spoke
to him.  It's time to clean, it said.  Clean up whatever is dirty.  There's
a lot of things that's soiled nowadays, you know!
  Yet  another  drowned  fool was picked up from the car in the pool.  "Ah,
anotherrr   fails!   Ah-ah-yeah  what  have  we  here?   Oh,  yeah  -  it's
enterrrtainment!".  Right!  It was entertainment!
  Life,  was  boring.   Death, was entertainment.  Life was a show.  A dare
devil  show  for  those who could stand it.  It could be acceptable, really
nice,  and comfortable.  But it was too late.  Too late to change anything.
Everything was dirty, ugly and destroyed.
  No  religion,  "god"  or  "devil"  could help now.  The world was falling
apart - imploding itself.  Soon, no one would remember it as it was when it
was clean.
 

                                    yes
                      this is my life, this is my gun
                   this is for killing, this is for fun 
                                 
  
  Later  that  evening  he  stepped  into  the  crowded  supermarket.   His
machine gun screamed about death and the bullets riddled with pleasure.
  Kill  kill kill.  Listen to what I have to say.  Six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven...
  Then  he  sat on a chair in a cold room.  Electrodes were strapped to his
feet.  A iron helmet would soon be placed on his shaved head.  A police man
bent  down  and  faced  him.   His  breath  filled the air and he heard him
whisper a question to him between his white lips.

  "Why?"

  "Why not?"
