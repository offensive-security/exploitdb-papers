              Thanks Phearless - one source for inspiration.
 
 
  This is a simple but fun joke for all you sick guys who just like to
make people go mad. It's disgusting, it's horrible, it causes permanent
brain damage for the victims...and it's cheap!
 
   You'll need:
 
   1) 20 ML Syringe
   2) Small tube - Length varies
   3) A red fluid
 
  There are many variations on this one and some are better than others.
We did like this: We filled the syringe with the fluid and put the 
tube on it. I placed it in my pocket and placed the end of the tube
under my arm so it pointed against the chest (under my clothes naturally).
  
  Then we entered one of these money-hungry supermarkets who just
sell food while catching as many shop-lifters as possible. My friend
walked to one of the staff and whispered "Hey! I saw that guy steal
something!" and pointed at me. "Aha! Good citizen! We'll take care of
this! Go away!".
 
  As we expected, the lame jerk ran to some other members of the staff
and surrounded me. "What have you stolen?!", they screamed.
"Nothing, I said.". We argued for a while and just when they where on
their way to take me to one of these "inner rooms" my friend came
running. "DON'T WORRY! I TAKE CARE OF THIS!". He ran up next to me
and pulled a realistic toy gun and fired a loud shot. 
 
  I pressed the syringe hard and the red fluid splashed all over the
inside of my skirt. I fell screaming to the floor and "died" while my
friend ran away. "Blood" dripped all over me and the floor.
 
  Chaos. The female staff fainted and achieved serious brain damage.
The others just got crazy. "Did you see that...he...KILLED him!"
After a while I ran away. MORE CHAOS! "He...he...oh god what happened?".

  You get the idea? Good...now go out and terrorize your friends. They
will buy this messy joke all the time! Just don't do it with much
cops around, they will not understand that it's a joke until after they have
shot someone.
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

  Oh, I forgot to mention, we did another thing. I placed the tube to
the back of my head and leaned against a wall. Then I committed "suicide" by
"shooting" myself in the mouth. In front of a crowd, hehehe!
