                              ANARCHIST UNITE
                             by THE GNN/DC/uXu


                       At first there was the human.

                           Then came The System.

                     And The System crushed the human.


      And those who didn't accept The System became the Anarchists.

        And The Anarchists believed that they could kill The System.

           The System looked down on The Anarchists and laughed.

                          The System was steady.

                         The first bomb exploded.

                            The System shaked.

                        The second bomb detonated.

                         The System begun to fall.
                  
                      The third bomb split the atom.
 
          The System lost The Power and anarchy ruled the world.

                The System looked upon the world and said:

                         "This world is our world"

                     The Anarchists laughed and said:
            
                     "This is not your world anymore!"

                          And The System replied:

               "It is. You are The System who kill yourself"
    
 The Anarchist laughed and placed a bullet between the eyes of The System.


                           The System was dead.
 
                        And The Anarchists united.

                         The spoke to each other.
                     
                         They watched each other.

                   And they would probably still do it.

             
                                    If.

              
                   They hadn't released the fourth bomb.

                                  
                                 Because.
  
           
     No matter where The Anarchist go, he will always find The System
