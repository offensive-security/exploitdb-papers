    It's a bit hard for me to cope with all of this.  I guess you don't
    know what I mean,  so I'll tell you.  Since uXu started,  only four
    releases ago, we have produced over 60 files. I know some files are
    pretty bad, but most of them are actually good. This may sound like
    bragging to you,  but I never  thought  we'd produce anything worth
    releasing after the 1:st  release!  I was wrong.  I'd like to thank
    The GNN for keeping the hope up,  and for continuing to write great
    files, when everything else seemed to go the other way.  I think it
    helped us all to continue when we really felt like quitting.

    Another subject now. Are we cloning cDc?
    Do you, our readers, feel that we're taking their material, or that
    we're trying to make our stuff look like their (really VERY good, I
    love them cDc files myself) stuff?  If so, we apologize.  Actually,
    the only thing  we've  copied from cDc is the  LONG  format for our
    releases,  and that's it.  Everything  we  publish is  genuine  and
    straight from the  author(s)  themselves.  Well,  because  we  have
    received comments about this, we want YOU to tell us what YOU think
    too! So, just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file
    and E-Mail  "The Chief"  with  your  comment.  We'll  include  YOUR
    comments  (unchanged) in  the next Index.  So dig up your modem and
    let us know.

    Now, when that's out of the way,  let's move on to this #5 release.
    This is really our  best release so far.  It includes a whole bunch
    of Fiction files with turning ends and scooped up stories,  as well
    as the standard weird  files too.  It also initiates an interesting
    competition for all you textfile-writers out there.

               Read uXu file #58 for complete information!

        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file and E-Mail
   The Chief for further information (if needed) or to let us know you'd
   like to join us. Don't hesitate! Call today!


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor may download files.

January  March  January  March  January  March  January  March  Releases 1992:

048: "AI" by The GNN.   A Chilling story from our now known Fiction
writer, The GNN. This one deals with Artificial Intelligence in the
future. I promise, you'll be surprised how good it is. Highly
recommended reading.

049: "Alarm!" by The GNN.  A fine poem only leaving you wanting more.
We've seen some new stuff by The GNN in this release, and it's not
just new, it's also extremely good. So, all of you, even though this
is a poem, and you might not read poems every day, take this one home.
If not for the poem itself, then for the final experience.

050: "Castle Chronicles Chapter Three" by The Chief.   What! Oh no! It's
yet another chapter of Steve Castle's investigation and search for the
Man that disappeared from the shoe store. This third chapter gives you
a pretty nasty turn in the story, as well as leaving you with an urge to
read the next chapter. Read all about it!

051: "How To Deal With The Police" by The GNN.   Life is tough. Ok,
we all know that, but are you prepared if one day, the cops bangs
on your door, throws you into their car, takes you downtown only to
question you for hours and hours? No? Then read this short manual.

052: "El Presidente - A Measure Of Handgun Shooting Skill" by The GNN.  
[Taken from the Guns & Ammo Magazine, February Issue 1992]. This
article tells you how the most preferred measure of shooting skill is
done. Maybe you'd like to try it out yourself to see if you're as
slick with your gun as you think you are? Get tha file, will ya!

053: "Friday The 17th" by The Chief.   When you're down in the gutter,
trying to get some help, only because 'it's just one of those days',
pick up this file for some comfort. For some it's Friday the 13th, for
others... it's another day.

054: "Errors" by The GNN.   Is it possible that you affect other people
by doing what you do? How can your dull afternoon in front of your
computer kill 1000's of people? Arthur Dent realized that in the oh-so-
good book The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams, but
is that really true? The GNN tells you the story.

055: "Eternal Life" by The GNN.   Yet another story from The GNN with
twisting tales and turning ends. Our new leader in the fiction business
doesn't let you down with this wonderful story. It's as good as his
earlier ones, and tells the story of a man working with a garage-made
time-machine.

056: "What Goes Around..." by The GNN.   Destroying Nuclear weapons,
de-militarize the earth, peace everywhere. Is it true that only good
things come out of it? Can it for example be a huge mistake to get
rid of all weapons? Why? Read this short thinking story.

057: "I Know Who You Are!" by The GNN.   Are you sure about who you
are, where you come from, and why you're here? Then skip this file.
If not, it's important that you read it as soon as possible. We're
letting you in on the secret here, so don't waste your time. Your
life depend on it!

058: "The uXu Annual Textfile Writer's Awards Information" by The Chief.
Introducing a new competition, as well as a way to receive the finest
and best textfiles floating around out there. This is the first file 
about the contest with vital information. Another file with more
information will be released closer to the actual awards. Get this file
now, and read through it and then leave your comments to your closest
uXu member. Please support this small request.

059: "Squib Joke" by The GNN.   This is a simple but fun joke for all
you sick guys who just like to make people go mad. It's horrible, it
causes permanent brain damage for the victim... and it's cheap too.
Just don't try it on your fellow uXu-ians!

060: "The Voice" by The GNN.   Life beyond the stars. Isn't it strange
we're still all alone down here on earth? Why can't we find life on
other planets? Is it something we're overlooking or just our destiny
to be alone? A fine story from The GNN.

061: "Torture With Things Laying Around At Home" by The GNN.   Aha!
You've got someone you want information from, and you don't know how
to do? Yessss, Torture! The best and only way. This file can be used
anytime. It requires that you have strapped the person to a chair or
something, and that you prevent him from escaping. Interested?

062: "uXu Index #5" by The Chief.   Already the 5th Index? Oh well, I
guess there's only one thing to do then. Get it, really. If you're one
of those who collect our files, you know that the Index contains;

          * An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          * Updated Member, Contributor and Support Board Lists.
          * An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          * All the new release files in Long format.
          * An updated list of boards where to contact uXu.
