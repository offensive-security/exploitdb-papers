                       "THE LAST NIGHT OF THE WORLD"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu

                "I should have been a pair of ragged claws
                scuttling across the floors of silent seas..."
                                              (T.S. Eliot)


  The last night of the world.
  It  was  the  last  night  of  freedom.   The  stars  had  company by the
impressive  fire  ball  that  was  the  comet  of Proteus.  It emerged from
nowhere,  a  sensation in astronomy and it headed towards Earth.  Crowds of
scientist,  well-educated men who ruled the world, discovered it and placed
another rock on the pile of scientific progress.  Eyes stared into japanese
monitors,  fingers  typed  fast on keyboards, modern high-tech calculations
were made.   People  wanted to know details.  Newspapers  dug  them  up and
presented them.  Everything was new, the comet of Proteus was a sensation.
  Someone  dropped  a  pen, and bent down with shaking hands to pick it up.
The dream of knowledge turned into a nightmare.  Proteus was not a friendly
visitor  that came by to say hello.  The hot rock, engulfed in gases had no
life,  but  were on its way to stop the entire world from rotating.  It was
on  its  way  to  the solar system.  The sun would grab it and drag it into
itself.   Planet  Earth happened to be in the way.  All scientific data had
the  same  message:   Doomsday  was  here.  In the early morning of seventh
july, there would be no more Earth.
  How  do  you tell a child that its parents are dead?  How do you tell the
population  of  Earth  that nothing meant anything any more?  Well-educated
men stood up and explained.  They were not sorry; they simply explained the
cold hard facts.  This was a scientific discovery, a result of sharp minds.
Warm  air  expands,  molecules  moves  quickly  under  pressure, light is a
mixture  of  matter  and  waves,  Proteus  was going to crush planet Earth.
There  was no place for free will, everything simply happens and we have to
accept it.  Our work is based upon analyzing how thing happen, not why they
happen.  Proteus is nothing more than bad luck.  No one sent it to kill us.
  It  will  just  happen.  In four days.  This is the facts, take them.  If
you leave them, you are blind.
  There  was nothing more to fight for.  Prisoners were released from jail,
the  government  left  their briefcases at work and walked home.  Everybody
waited  for  anarchy in the streets.  As if it would matter.  But there was
no  violence  any  more.   Guns  pointed downward, below the hot sun in the
arabian  desert.   Enemies  looked at enemies and turned their back at each
other.   Dirty  faces  in the jungle placed their weapons on the ground and
left the bunkers.  Street-smart gang members did not care any more.
  Big  city,  full  of life.  In four days, blown to pieces and spread over
space,  the  last  frontier.   Countries, held together by invisible powers
that  had  created  border  lines and complex economical structures was not
there  any  more.   Society had been a secure prison built of playing cards
that now fell to the floor and vanished.
  Call  your  mother,  you  have  not done it for four years.  Talk to her.
Apologize  to  your  neighbor.  Move back to the house by the mill that you
had  to  leave  because your money was gone.  Read the book.  Think.  Think
about  what  you  really  did  with your life.  Think of all the things you
planned  to  do  in  life  and  realize  how  much  of it that was actually
worthless.   Why  did you want to educate yourself to become a brick in the
game,  play the game well and earn money?  Earn money, become something and
earn money.  Die with your coffin filled to the limit with dollars.
  This  was  the  last night of the world.  No television, only a few radio
stations  with  calm voices who talked about nothing and played music.  The
streets  were  filled with people who watched the sky.  Proteus looked down
on  them.   What  if  he can think too?  some wondered.  Father time was no
longer a friend.  He had become Death who rolled on his skates and laughed.
Faster,  death  thought.   Faster!  The last global problem was how to slow
down  time.  Stop the clocks!  Do nothing!  Get bored!  Try to cheat Father
time!
  How  could  any  one  do  that?   It  was no longer nations and races who
snatched  the  latest news.  It was only humans, people and individuals who
slowly and humble thought about the meaning of life while waiting.
  Waiting for Proteus.  Even Proteus was not seen as an enemy.  Proteus was
a  simple  comet,  that flew through deep space.  It had no history, it was
just there.  Bad luck.
  Where  was all the expected hysteria?  Where was the violence?  Where was
judgement day, filled with confessions and rage?
  For  the first time, people finally got the answer.  The expectations had
been  made  by everybody, for everybody else.  They will do it, I will not.
They  will  become  mad, I will not.  They will fall to their knees and beg
for  mercy,  I will not.  I am a rational human being, I accept the results
of the scientific progress.  They will not.  I know best.  Or do I?
  It seems like I do not.
  The  last  night  fell.   The  sun  disappeared  to never return over the
horizon  again.   The  thick  black  darkness was kept away with white cold
lights  from lamp-posts and neon signs.  For the first time in modern time,
the  modern  rational  human beings, raised their heads and watched the sky
while thinking and analyzing dogmatic and philosophical questions.  Science
had  suddenly turned out to be without meaning in real life.  This was real
life.   The  real  life  come  to an end.  Scientific problems are forever.
They  do  not  solve  anything in the end.  Life, is worth living.  We, the
people,  are not meant to accept facts without meaning.  If we had listened
to  out  own  thoughts,  out lives had been filled with more substance.  We
were  born  to  listen  to  what  others say.  What they said was important
became  important  for  us.   Now  is  that  not so any more.  Now, when we
finally released ourselves from the chains of pseudo-problems, we can start
a  new  beginning.  But now it is too late to live.  Proteus is coming down
to stop us.  Maybe we owe the comet a lot.  Without it, we had been chained
for  the rest of our lives.  Now we can free our imagination, even if it is
for only one night.

  But.

  Proteus  never  came.   The  next  day  it appeared that the comet missed
planet  Earth  with a range that was too far away to be hazardous.  The sun
entered  the  sky from the horizon as if nothing had happened.  Nothing had
happened.  It was a new day.  Everything was ready to be explained.
  It took more than two years before everything went back to a normal state
again.   The  invisible  hand  slowly  grabbed  the population.  Countries,
governments  and  violence  returned.   People  lowered  their  heads.  The
meaning of life was once again replaced with a thirst for more money.
  Science threw another stone to the pile of progress.
  Blushing  individuals  quickly  placed  their  dogmatic and philosophical
questions in the darkest closet.  The door was closed to hopefully never be
opened again.
  If not Proteus returns once again.
