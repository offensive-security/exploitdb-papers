                          "it is always the same
                          the one who stop is left to blame
                          take, what you can take
                          is your idea of a game"

  Let  me  tell  you  about  something that I prefer to call the Lynch Mob.
They  are  people who are the non-military troops of our society.  They are
very  easy  to  control  and they are in majority of the population.  It is
important to understand that the lynch mob are not aware of their function.
They live in the belief that they are free.  Like most of us do.
  The  lynch  mob  consist  of  many various people.  They are all slightly
uneducated  but  they  are  ruled  by  people  who  claim  to  be educated.
Economists, politicians and lawyers have tools to control them.  Words like
democracy and the law are unbreakable arguments that will get the lynch mob
to  do  everything they tell them to do.  The reason is pure egoistical; if
they can control the mob, they can remain in a leading position - no matter
the consequences.
  The  well-educated leaders have no conscience.  The society is on its way
down  the  pit to crash. We are sitting on a sledge hammer, looking up, but
still  on our way down. There are a few rational humans left who try to get
the lynch mob to understand what is really happening. An impossible mission
since  the  educated  leaders have told the lynch mob that these people are
nothing  more than anarchistic terrorists that tries to crush them and take
their luxury articles away.
  The  economical  system of the world does not work properly.  It is based
upon  guesses  from  the  crystal ball of economists who claim to know what
they are doing. They do not. They are only small children who wants to open
their  presents  before christmas - and they do. They open the presents and
spread them to the lynch mob to control them and the economical system will
go  down  to  yet another crisis because of this. However, the lynch mob is
not  aware  of  this.  They get their high standard society for a while and
when  it  all falls apart they do not attack their leaders and ask "Why did
you do this? Why did you all fool us to believe that you knew what you were
doing?".  No,  the  lynch  mob  drools  and  turns on the radio to find the
fall-guy.  The leaders will cooperate to find one. Niggers, the communists,
old people - anything will do.
  The  lynch  mob  will attack.  In a rage, they will kill people mentally.
Statistic charts will show that the fall-guy is responsible for the crisis.
But  who are behind the statistic?  The leaders?  No, they have created the
fall-guy,  they simply wait for the result.  It is the lynch mob themselves
that  creates the statistic, based upon their own guesses, and accepts them
as the truth to everything.
  The  result  will  be a long process.  The lynch mob will accept that the
economical  crisis  is because of Reason A.  The lynch mob will demand that
Reason  A  is  killed, maimed and to be thrown down the toilet.  Of course,
the  leaders  will  obey since this is what they wanted in the first place.
After  that,  the  leaders  can  get rid of other things that they have not
liked  for  a while.  This will especially strike hard against the rational
humans.  Since Reason A was too expensive for the country, then Reason B is
that  too. Reason B can be everything from students who study arts subjects
to too low taxes on flowers. The lynch mob will agree, since they have been
in charge of the fair Reason A execution.
  A  fine  example  of the lynch mob being controlled to believe everything
that  the leaders dig up can be seen in Sweden.  Sweden, a small country in
the north of Europe, have for the past fifty years accepted immigrants from
other  countries.  It  all  started after the second world war when Finland
licked  their  wounds  after the war against Russia and thousands of people
moved  to  Sweden.  The  reason  was  economical. Sweden needed workers and
Finland  was poor. The finnish people could work for almost nothing. Today,
refugees come  to Sweden because  they cannot live in their own country due
to  cruel leaders who sadistically screams for war and destruction of their
so-called  enemies. These immigrants are not economically good, the leaders
say.  They are simple parasites who want our luxury articles. Suddenly, the
lynch  mob are all xenophobians and experiences the fear from other people.
Arguments  like that the immigrants are too expensive are swallowed. No one
cares  about  the  human  rights  any  more. Cash is king. Other humans are
nothing  more  than  walking  money.  The  lynch mob and their leaders, are
however  fine  people who know what they are doing. "Throw them back to the
place  they  came  from!  Let them not take our democracy and rape it! They
have already done so in a small way, since we have an economical crisis! It
is  their fault, not ours! Throw them out of our country!". The leaders had
to explain the economical crisis and they did. They found the fall-guy; the
immigrants.
  The  lynch  mob  is not always as easy to control by the leaders.  If the
lynch  mob  enjoys  something  that  the  leaders  do  not, then there is a
problem.  The lynch mob enjoys drinking alcohol, but the leaders feels that
alcohol  costs  too  much  to  be  fun.  Yes,  the  leaders  drink  alcohol
themselves,  but  they know that they would afford it anyway even if it was
forbidden  for  everyone  else.  The leaders are educated and believes that
they  know  what  they  are doing. So, of course they believe that they can
control their drinking better than the uneducated stupid lynch mob. If this
is  the  situation,  the  leaders have to use other dirty tricks to get the
lynch  mob  to  "understand".  The  leaders  will  find  another  fall-guy,
preferably  someone  who  can  be blamed for all the mess that alcohol have
created.  If this fails, the "democratic" leaders will forbid it anyway and
convince  the  lynch  mob that they are too stupid to understand why. It is
here  that the lynch mob really shows that they are completely stupid. They
do  not shout for revolution, they simply accept that they are nothing more
than grown up children who needs to be ruled.
  Are  you  a  part of the stupid uneducated lynch mob, or maybe one of the
nice  worthless  egoistical  leaders?   Or are you one of the few remaining
rational  humans  who  have seen the world from another angle, and who will
soon - if nothing is done - be eliminated?
