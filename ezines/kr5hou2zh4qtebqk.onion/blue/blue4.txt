          BLUE BOX FREQUENCIES:
 
  2600 HZ - USED TO GET ON/OFF TRUNK
 
  TONE MATRIX TO USE AFTER 2600 HZ.
 
   700:  1  :  2  :  4  :  7  :  11  :
 
   900:  +  :  3  :  5  :  8  :  12  :

       900  :1100 :1300 :1500 : 1700 :
 
 
 
  USE KP (1700+1100) TO START A CALL AND
  ST (1500+1700) TO STOP. USE 2600 HZ TO
  DISCONNECT.

              RED BOX FREQS:
 
     1700 HZ AND 2200 HZ MIXED TOGETHER
 
    A NICKEL IS 66 MS ON (1 BEEP). A DIME IS 66MS ON, 66MS OFF,
  66MS ON (2 BEEPS) A QUARTER IS 33MS ON, 33MS OFF REPEATED 5
  TIMES. (MS= MILLISECOND). FOR  THOSE OF  YOU  WHO   DONT  KNOW,
  A  RED  BOX SIMULATES MONEY  BEING  PUT  INTO A PAY PHONE. YOU
  MUST PUT IN SOME MONEY FIRST THOUGH (THE OPERATOR  CAN TELL IF
  MONEY WAS PUT IN BUT AS TO HOW MUCH, SHE LETS THE COMPUTER
  ANSWER THAT)
 
  -------------------------------------
 
           TASI LOCKING FREQ:
 
    TASI   (  TIME    ASSIGNMENT   SPEECH INTERPOLATION )  IS
  USED  ON  SATELITE TRUNKS, AND BASICALLY  ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE
  PERSON TO USE A  TRUNK  BY  PUTTING THEM ON  WHILE  THE OTHER
  PERSON  ISNT TALKING. OF  COURSE,  YOU'D  NEVER HEAR THE OTHER
  PERSON TALKING ON YOUR TRUNK.
 
    WHEN YOU START TO  TALK, HOWEVER, THE TASI CONTROLLER  HAS TO
  FIND  AN  OPEN TRUNK FOR YOU. BECAUSE  OF  THIS,  SOME OF YOUR
  SPEECH  IS LOST( BECAUSE OF THE DELAY  IN  FINDING  A  TRUNK)
  THIS  IS CALLED CLIPPING.
 
    WELL,  IF YOU WERE  TRANSMITTING DATA OVER  A  TRUNK,
  CLIPPING  WOULD REALLY FUCK UP THE DATA. SO THERE IS SOMETHING
  CALLED A TASI  LOCKING FREQUENCY  WHICH KEEPS THE TASI FROM
  PUTTING ANYONE ELSE ON YOUR TRUNK OR  YOU  ON  ANYONE ELSES
  TRUNK. IN ANY CASE  THE FREQ.  IS  1850 HZ. SENT BEFORE THE
  TRANSMISSION).
