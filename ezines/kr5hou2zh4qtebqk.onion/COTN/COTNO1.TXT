Welcome to CoTNo!  This publication is the prodigy of The New Order, Colorado's
best hacking group.  We have created this 'zine to help teach what we have
learned and discovered from our combined years of experience.  This is not
intended to be an ultra-technical collection of barely useful information, but
rather a forum for spreading current H/P/A knowledge and practices to the
newer members of the 'scene'.  You will not find mind-numbing overly technical
reports here.  Nor will you be wasting your time and hard-drive by downloading
useless articals on non-H/P/A topics like gambling and car theft.  All articals
contained in CoTNo have useful applications in today's heavily computerized
and automated society.  Some well experienced hackers may find these texts to
be old hat, but we feel the scene has been dying because of a lack of basic
hacking tutorials.  The goal of the writers of this publication and the
members of TNo is to educate and enlighten in order to recreate the booming
scene of the 80's.

The New Order (TNo) are the main writers and supporters of this 'zine.  We
are composed of hackers, phreakers, and "hairy-eyed anarchists" from the
Colorado area. We recently recieved some minor publicity in a comment found
in The Seed Magazine: Denver's Rag of Underground Culture.  The following is
an exerpt from the June/July '93 issue:

     "Hackers - no longer a small underground phenomenon, these computer whiz-
     kids have become a highly organized network of post-modern renegades.
     With everything in our lives being computerised, today's hackers are able
     to gain unbelievable access into just about everything.  They communicate
     to each other via BBS (Bulletin Board System) and trade tips on everything
     from music to ripping off the phone company.  The buzz around town is
     about Flatline, a BBS run by the hacking crew, TNO."

Not exactly the front page of Time, but at least this was a POSITIVE statement
by the media on the hacking phenomenon.

We accept submissions to CoTNo from anyone who has willingness to teach and
can get on Flatline.  There will also be a CoTNo mailing address soon.  This
mag' will be published on a quarterly basis.

PREFACE
-------

        A VMB, in case you don't know, stands for Voice Mail Box.  A VMB works
like a multiuser answering machine.  A company will puchase a VMB so its
employees will be able to leave messages to each other.  Each employee will
have a seperate box number assigned to him and be given a "default password"
for his VMB.  The employee is then able to leave a greeting on his mail box
and change the password.  Whenever someone calls him, they will get his VMB
if he does not answer his line.  The caller can then leave a message to the
employee.

        Hackers and Phreaks steal VMB's so they can contact each other and
spread information around.  You can give them to friends, you can trade them
for access on boards, or keep them for yourself.  Some boxes even have the
ability to call out so you can use them for phreaking!

        The Audix or Audio Information Exchange system sold by AT&T is one of
the better VMB's on the market.  It has many message options, it is highly
configurable, and has many security options.  Lucky for us, it also has some
neat options that make it very easy to hack!


SCANNING FOR AUDIX VMB'S
------------------------

        To find a VMB, you will have to scan.  Either pick a popular business
exchange in your area code (like 669, 721, 220, etc.), or try the riskier 800
area code.  The 800 area code VMB's are better but Ma Bell's computers (ESS)
keep a list of any number that makes excessive calls to 800 numbers.  Do your
scanning at night so you won't have to worry about reaching someone at their
desk.  Start at 0000 and work your way to 9999 sequentially.  Write down any
interesting numbers you find.  If you get some kind of answering machine, mark
it as a possible VMB.

        When your done scanning, recall each of the possible VMB's.  Some
Audix systems will answer with the greeting "Welcome to Audix..." while others
will just begin with the employee's greeting.  Press *7 (the asterick then the
seven).  You will here "Welcome to Audix..." if it is an Audix VMB.


WHAT TO DO ONCE YOU FIND ONE
----------------------------

        Now that you have a list of Audix VMB numbers, call one of them and
get yourself a box!  When you first reach a box, you are in record mode.  You
have a number of options available to you in this mode:

                KEY             ACTION
                ---             ------
                1               Begin recording.
                1               Stop recording.
                *#              Approve message.
                *1              Review message.
                *3              Delete message.
                2               Rewind message.
                3               Playback message.
                6               Advance message a few seconds.
                5               Replay the last few seconds.
                4               Turn volume up.
                7               Turn volume down.
                8               Slow down message.
                9               Speed up message.

You also have the following Audix master functions available to you:

                KEY             FUNCTION
                ---             --------
                *R              To retrieve a box.
                *H              To get help at any time.
                *T              To transfer to another box.
                *W              To have the system wait.
                **N             To access the directory.


        To get your own box, you must first find some empty boxes.  While you
are in record mode, press *T.  The system will tell you to enter either a
three or four number digit number extension and the pound sign.  Remember
how many digits the box numbers are.  Now press **N. This will take you to the
directory.  Press *A to look up boxes by their extension.  Start scanning for
boxes sequentially.  Start at either the highest number or lowest number (999
or 000) and work your way to the other end.  To scan a box number, enter the
box number and press the pound sign.  You will hear one of three responses:

        1.  The name of the box owner.
        2.  "Box number XXX is not a valid box".
        3.  "Box number XXX".

If you hear either response one or response two, go on to the next box.  If
you hear response 3, BINGO!  You just found an empty box so write it down and
move on to the next box.  After you are finished scanning, press *#.


HOW TO BREAK INTO AN EMPTY BOX
------------------------------

        While in record mode, press *R.  You will here a message like "Welcome
to the Audix Activity Menu..."  Enter one of the empty box numbers you found
and press the #.  It will now tell you to enter your password and press the #.
The password will be a three or four digit combination of numbers. The default
password is usually something obvious so try some of the following:

                   PASSWORD            NOTE
                   --------            ----
                   Box Number          This is the most common
                   No password         Just press pound, also common
                   1234                \
                   9999                  > Occasionally
                   1111                /

Once you figure out the default password for one empty box, you can access all
the boxes you found during your scan by using the default.


WHAT TO DO ONCE YOU'RE IN
-------------------------

        You will know when you have broken into a box when you hear a message
like "Extension XXX, you have no new messages."  You can now set up your
personal box.  The following is a list of the functions available to you:

                KEY             FUNCTION
                ---             --------
                 1              Create a message.
                 2              Retrieve messages left for you.
                 3              Change your greeting.
                 4              Check out messages left by you.
                 5              Change password.
                 6              Change call notification information.
                **R             Relog into your box.
                **N             Enter the directory.

The first thing you should do is change your password!  You don't want
anybody to hack YOUR box.


ADVANCED AUDIX
--------------

        Sometimes you will find boxes that have no name, but don't have a
default.  Transfer to the box and check it out.  It might be a carrier.
Audix's are usually found on System 75/85 PBX's which can be accessed via
modem.  Call it with your modem and if you get a prompt that looks like
Logon: you have scored big.  A tutorial on hacking System 75/85's can be
found elswhere in this 'zine.

If you transfer to the box and you hear a quick beep without hearing any type
of greeting, you have found a bridge.  Have a friend call the system and
transfer to the same box after you have and see if you can talk to each
other.  All System 75/85's have the capability to bridge extensions but this
option is rarely used.  If you find a bridge, only call it late at night so
you don't stumble into valid conference.


CONCLUSION
----------

        You should be a master at hacking Audix VMB's now.  You can use many
similar techniques on other brands of VMB's too.  Be conservative with your
boxes.  The more boxes you snag from one company, the more likely they will
notice you and shut you out.  If you do end up with 500 boxes, use them to
trade with.  You can get better access on boards, money, or equipment for
them.  Have Phun!

INTRO
~~~~~
  System 75/85's..The gateway to the world of the PBX...If one can hack these
machines, one has the ability to generate many codes for himself, and his
fellow phreakers/hackers to use and enjoy.  Hacking these machines can be
very fun, but if one does not know what he's doing, it could be frustrating
and potentially risky. That's why I am writing this text.  This file includes
captures from two hacks I did.  In the first hack, I will show you how I went
thru, saw that the company did not have a PBX, and made my own for my own
personal gateway to free LD.  In the second hack you will see how I simply
looked, saw the PBX, and quickly found the correct trunk, changing nothing.

  Version 2 is definately the better way to hack a system.  If you change
things, it will show up on the system log.  Along comes a system
administrator to read the log, and yer busted.  But if you don't change
anything, no one will ever know you were there...Of course, many times, it
becomes nescessary to change things, if the company dosn't already have a PBX
installed...You must make your own.  For ease of reading, I have gone thru
and edited/commented on everything I did in both hacks.  Hopefully I made
it easy to understand..Good luck hacking System 75!

INTRO
~~~~~
This a list compiled by the members of The New Order from frequent visits to
UNiX hosts.  These are default accounts/passwords observed in hosts running
UNiX variations including System V, BSD, Xenix, and AiX.  These defaults are
included in standard setup on various machines so the Sysadmin can log on
for the first time.  Often the negligent Sysadmin forgets to delete or pass-
word the accounts.  This makes UNiX machines extremely easy to infiltrate.
This artical does not go into specifics of hacking but it is highly
suggested that you immediately copy the /etc/passwd file (/etc/security/
passwd in AiX machines!) so you can later run a dictionary hacker and get
some other accounts and insure your access.  This is list of default
accounts which are often unpassworded.  If the system asks for a password,
try the account name which sometimes works.

CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~
Have phun but be careful!  Learn what to do before you run out and invade
some systems.  These won't do you any good if you can't hide your tracks.
Hacking is all about learning about cool stuff, but you can't hack until
you learn how.  Njoy.

        Postal chislers used to mail letters unstamped in the knowledge
that they would be delivered anyway... with "Postage Due"to the recipient.
It took a stingy person to mail personal letters this way, but many people
did send mail this way on bill payments. So the Post Office changed it's
policy. It stopped delivering letters without stamps. But a letter with a
stamp.. even a one cent stamp...is delivered postage due if need be. A letter
with no stamp is returned to the sender.

        Naturally, this has just opened up a new way pf cheating. Letters can
now be mailed for free by switching the positions of the delivery address and
the return address. If there is no stamp on the envelope, it will be Returned
to the address in the upper left corner.. which is where you want it to go in
the first place. Unlike the old system, the letter is not postage-due. At
most the recipient gets a stamped purple reminder that "The Post Office does
not deliver mail without postage."

        At least one large company seems to have adapted this principle to
it's billing. Citibank bases it's MasterCard operations in Sioux Falls, South
Dakota. The bill payment envelopes have the Citibank Sioux Falls address in
both the delivery address and return address positions. (Most bill payments
envelopes have three lines for the customer to write in his or her return
address.) Therefore, regardless of whether the customer puts a stamp on the
envelope, it is delivered to Citibank. (The return-address gimmick works even
when the return address is in a different state from the mailing point.)

        Who is cheating whom? If the customer puts correct postage on the
envelope, it is delivered to Sioux Falls at the customer's expense. No one
is slighted. If, on the other hand, the customer intentionally omits the
stamp, the payment is delivered at Post Office expense. Then the customer has
cheated the Post Office. The Post Office also loses out if the customer
honestly forgets to put a stamp on the envelope. But then blame ought to be
shared with the peculiar design of Citibank's envelope.

        Citibank's motive is plain: If the envelopes are returned to forgetful
customers, it delays payment.

INTRO
^^^^^
Red boxing has quickly become Colorado's elite game of choice.  Ever since
I dug up the 2600 plans and passed them out, it seems like every phreak in
Colorado has built one.  Many questions, though, have arisen.  To hopefully
cut down on my e-mail, I present here the complete guide to using red boxes.


CHOOSING A PAY PHONE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the simplest part of red boxing.  You must use an authentic U.S.
West (or other Baby Bell) payphone.  If the phone does not say U.S. West
or have the bell symbol somewhere on it, it is a COCOT and cannot be boxed.


LONG DISTANCE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The most common reason for building a red box is of course to make long
distance calls.  This is also the easiest way to use them.  To make the
call just dial:

                      1 + Area Code + Number

You will then here a computer voice ask you to deposit an amount of money.
Make the quarter tones until you hear the voice say "Thank you".


LONG DISTANCE WITHIN AN AREA CODE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a little bit trickier.  Normally, U.S. West handles any calls within
an area code.  Unfortunately, U.S. West switching systems are not fooled by
red box tones.  To get around this inconvenience, you must route your call
through a long distance carrier.  You must first decide which carrier you
want to skam.  Here is a list of some of the major carriers available in
Colorado and their equal access codes.

AT&T         10288 or 10732
MCI          10222 or 10888 or 10789
Sprint       10333
Metromedia   10488 or 10999
Encore       10805 or 10555
Allnet       10444
Tel. Xpress  10465
ACI          10244
U.S. Tel.    10471
LDDS         10001
One 2 One    10390

To make the call dial:

                    Access Code + 1 + Area Code + Number

Once again you will be told to deposit money, feed 'em the quarter tones.


LOCAL
^^^^^
To make a local call, you must also route the call through a long distance
carrier.  To make the call, dial:

                          Access Code + Number

Thats it!  You will be told to deposit money as usual so unleash the tones.


DURING THE CALL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your call is over five minutes, you will hear a click at that time.  This
means you have spent all your money and are running on credit.  Two minutes
later you will be cut off temporarily and you will hear the computer ask you
for some more money.  Deposit tones until you hear the voice say "Thank you".
Remember, the party you are calling will here the tones as well.  After you
have "paid" you will be reconnected to your party.


AFTER THE CALL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you are done, push the reciever down for a few seconds then let off and
listen.  If you went over your time, the computer voice will come on and ask
you to pay the amount you went over.  Pay with tones as usual.  If you just
hang up, the phone will ring and there will be an operator on the other end
asking for money.  Don't use the red box if you are talking to an operator.
Either pay with real money or take off.


CONCLUSION
^^^^^^^^^^
Red boxing is phun and easy as long as you know what you are doing.  Memorize
those access codes (or at least one) and you will be good to go.  I have
been red boxing for quite a while now and have never had any problems nor
have any of my receiving parties ever been harrassed by the Gestapo.  If you
don't have the plans, call your local P/H BBS or contact somebody in TNO or
leave me mail on Flatline.

Introduction:  The purpose of this manuscript is to introduce useful phreaking
-------------  techniques.  These techniques have been developed by the Third
Cartel and have proved to be convenient and reliable.

Field Phreaking Kit:
====================

The Field Phreaking Kit is a neccessity for the serious phreaker.  Some
so-called phreaks get all of their information including codes from BBSs and
have an ego big enough to call themselves phreaks.  The real phreak acquires
knowledge on his own through perseverence and ingenuity.  Following is a list
of useful items for your Phreaking Kit:

o  Backpack:  Get one:  Very Handy.  We'll tell you how to get one or make one.
o  Ratchet Set:  Usually, you'll only need 7/16 and 3/8" size ratchets.
o  Screwdrivers:  Get medium and large screwdrivers, and a phillips head.
o  Wire Cutters:  Just in case you want to wipe out some lines.
o  Pliers:  For misc. stuff.
o  Xacto or Pocket Knife:  To strip or cut wires.
o  Penlight:  Nice and small; very useful for night work.
o  Flashlight:  If you need lots of light and have enough room in your pack.
o  Gloves:  Make sure you don't get shocked or leave your fingerprints around.
o  Pencil and Paper:  Write down locations, notes, numbers, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Third Cartel carries the following optional materials in their Field Kit:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Walki-Talkies:  For communications when yelling isn't possible or smart.
o  Battery Operated Camara Flash:  Good for flashing in someone's eyes at night
                                   Will blind a telco guy for a few seconds.
o  Mace/Dog Repellant:  Spray in someone's eyes if they give you trouble.
o  Smoke Bomb:  Helpful to divert attention or scare. [drop in telco car]
                [Mix 3 parts potassium nitrate with 2 parts sugar and melt]
o  Matches:  For smoke bomb or anything that is flammable.
o  Bandana/Surgical Mask:  Manholes are dusty; Wear these for easier breathing.
o  Marker:  Mark your "territory" on phone boxes.
o  Fake Telco ID Card:  Will make some people think that you work for telco.

Organize your kit so you know where everything is and can get something quickly
when needed.  You don't want to be fumbling for your mace when the gestapo is
about to get you.

Test Phone:
===========

The Test Phone is the most useful piece of equipment for Field Phreaking.  You
can try to sneak into a telco Plant Department [truckyard] and get a real test
phone out of a truck like we did.  If you'd rather not do this, don't worry;
making your own test phone is ultra-easy.

First, get a telephone for your own purposes.  Find the wire coming out of the
phone that is supposed to go to the wall's modular jack.  It should be at least
three feet long for convienience.  Cut off the modular jack at the end of the
wire.  Strip the wire, and there should be two or four small  wires inside.
Hook the two middle wires to alligator clips [preferably insulated]. You now
have a test phone!  Very easy, indeed.  Now let's see if you hooked everything
up ok.  First find your phone box.  It'll probably be on the outside of your
house.  It's farly small, and you might need the ratchet to open it up.  Once
you get it open, you should see some screws.  These are the terminals for your
phone line.  Hook the alligator clips to the two top terminals.  If your phone
is ok, you should get a dial tone.  Once you know that your phone is working,
a whole new world opens up to you!  You can hook the phone up to your
neighbor's terminal and call long distance or yell at the operator on their
line.  Be careful, though.  You don't want to be talking to Sue in L.A. when
your neighbors are home and awake.  If they pick up the phone when you're
already on, you could get into serious trouble.  Of course, you could always
listen in on them!  If you want, you can hook wires up to your neighbor's
terminal and lead them to your house.  In case you didn't know, this is called
Beige Boxing.  You can then hack computers on their line, call Dial-A-Prayer,
etc.  Make sure to hide the wire well so that it won't be traced to your
house!

Manholes:
=========

One way to get access to an abundance of phone lines is by getting into telco
manholes.  You don't want to accidentally get in a sewer manhole, so the first
thing to do is find the differences between sewer and telephone manholes.  If
you have trouble with this, here's a few tips that might help:
o  Telco manhole covers are usually larger and heavier than other covers.
o  Telco manholes are scarce compared to sewer manholes.  So if there are
   a lot of checkered manhole covers in your area, those are probably sewer
   manholes.  If there are only a handful of unmarked manhole covers in
   your area, those probably contain phone lines.
o  Go to your local telco Central Office [CO] and find out what the manhole
   covers look like there.  Find manhole covers that look the same in other
   areas, and pick a convenient/safe manhole to explore.

Getting into a manhole is a different story.  Here in the Denver area, it takes
at least three people to get a manhole cover off.  Hopefully it'll be easier
to do in your area.  To open the manhole, you'll probably need at least two
crowbars [You could try using a pickaxe].  Get a group together to open the
manhole, using 2 or more people with crowbars to slide the cover off.  You
might want to get a strong guy to push the manhole cover while the other people
with crowbars support it.  If you know of a tool that was made specifically
for opening manholes, we'd appreciate it if you contacted us on some local
Denver boards and told us about it.  Likewise, if you have a better system for
opening manholes, we'd be grateful for the information.

Once you get the manhole cover off, shine a flahlight down to see if there's
a ladder going to the bottom.  Try a different manhole if there's no ladder.
If you want to go down a manhole, don't forget to wear a bandana or surgical
mask over your mouth so that you don't choke on dust.  Also bring a flashlight
so you can see what you're doing.  Many times, there'll be a few inches of
water at the bottom, so you might also want to wear boots.

Down in the manhole, you might find some equipment or manuals.  Go ahead and
take them if you want; you deserve it!  There should be some very large ABS.
The phone lines are inside these tubes.  Attached to this tubing there will
be some short, wide plastic cylinders.  There'll be screws holding these
cylinders on to the tubing.  You'll need either a screwdriver or a ratchet
to open a cylinder.  If you happen to get a cylinder open, congratulations!
You now have access to countless phone lines!  We'll leave it to you to
figure out what to do with all of those wires.  Surely you'll figure
something out!  [snip, snip!]

Exploring Telco Building Sites:
===============================

One of the best ways to get information about telco is by going to a Central
Office near you, exploring the trucks in a Plant Department, or "visiting"
other telco buildings.  The phone company is careless in many ways.  They
leave important, yet unshredded documents and computer printouts in their
open dumpsters.  Their cars, vans, and repair vehicles are almost always left
unlocked.  Inside their vehicles one can usually find manuals, test phones,
computer cards [usually for mainframes, almost never for personal comuters],
nice tool sets, etc.!  It's almost as if they *want* to be ripped off!  They
deserve bad treatment just for their negligence.  If possible, we like to be
courteous to individual employees of telco.  Most employees are fairly amiable
and don't deserve trouble.  It's the beuracracy of telco that deserves to be
manhandled.  Cheap practices such as monopolizing and the overpricing of
services is the general reason why we phreaks do what we do with such
determination.  On with the show.

Exploring Dumpters:  Looking inside telco dumpters is probably the easiest way
to acquire useful information.  Typycally, dumpters will be found outside a
Central Office.

Introduction:  The purpose of this manuscript techniques have been developed
by the Third Cartel and have proved to be convenient and reliable.  This
manuscript is a continuation of Manuscript II: Field Phreaking.

Pay Phone Hacking:
==================

The safest way to get phreaking codes is by hacking them on a pay phone.  The
chances of getting caught are extremely remote, especially if you switch pay
phones every few minutes.  One problem with hacking codes is that when you find
a code by dialing it randomly, you often forget what code you dialed.  To
prevent this, we print out a sheet filled with 6-8 digit random codes on the
computer.  Then we start testing each of these codes off of a 950 number.  This
works great, especially since 950s are not charged!  Cross off each code on the
paper that doesn't work, and mark the ones that do work.  This technique takes
a lot of patience, but it's worth it if you have a terrible short-term memory.

Telco Boxes:
============

This is our prime focus in Manuscript III.  Every field phreaker worth his
weight in dung should at least know the basics about phone boxes.  There are so
many different types that we can only cover the major groups.  But once you
learn about a few boxes, it'll be easy to learn about others.  Be sure to
bring a test phone with you [see Manuscript II] so you can connect up to phone
lines.

Small Boxes:  Small telephone boxes typically contain 1 to 20 different phone
------------  lines.  They are usually in convenient and safe locations.  They
are easy to open, and can be closed quickly.

Home Boxes:  Unless you live in an apartment complex, your home box shoud be
very easy to locate.  It is small box located on the side of your house;
usually a foot or two of the ground.  Many times it will be beige colored
and may require a ratchet [Usually 3/8"] to open.  If you have more than one
line in your house, your box will probably be fairly large and light gray.
You'll need a ratchet and a screwdriver to open a two-line box.  In the
one-line box there will be five terminals or screws.  The top two screws should
have red and green wires leading to them.  If you connect your test phone clips
to these screws, you'll be on the line.  Usually, the two screws below contain
the same phone line.  The very bottom screw, in the middle, is the ground.  In
the two-line boxes, you should be able to figure out how to hook up to the
lines rather easily.  They even have a modular plug jack that you can plug a
normal phone into.  There are also several terminals that you can hook the
clips up to.

Aluminum Multi-Line Boxes:  These boxes are usually found behind business
buildings and shopping centers.  Some condominium complexes also have these
boxes hooked up to walls on a few units.  Each box contains five or more phone
lines.  The boxes are rectangular and made of aluminum, are very easy to open
and close, and often say "Western Electric" on the front.  Once you get the box
open, you will see several pairs of terminals grouped diagonally.  Simply
attach your phone clips to a correct pair, and you'll be on a phone line.  Run
an ANI on the phone line to find its number.  If your phone happens to be
polarity sensitive, and you get no dial tone when hooked up to terminals,
reverse the alligator clips and you'll be on the line.

Small Distribution Boxes:  These boxes, usually either light green, or a very
dark green, are not very common, and can be found behind shopping centers,
houses, and other buildings.  You'll probably need the ratchet to open it,
and a knife to strip some wires.  The top of the box pulls off if you loosen
the screws enough.  Inside, there will be several wires.  Two different sizes
of wires are found in distribution boxes.  The larger wires lead to nearby
buildings.  The smaller wires lead to another distribution box where they are
spliced yn.  These boxes take the most time to use because they have no
terminals and you have to find the correct wire pairs.  It's easiest to find
the large wire pairs, so start out with those.  Once you find a phone line,
you might want to tape together or label the wire pair for future reference.
Use the same procedure for the smaller wires.  If you find a good box, and
are willing to take the time, these boxes can be very worthwhile!

Medium Boxes:  Medium boxes carry more lines than small boxes but are usually
-------------  found in somewhat risky locations.  Most of them require a
ratchet for access, and they usually open on a hinged door.

Medium Distribution Boxes:  These are identical to the small distribution
boxes, but carry far more phone lines.  Many times, after taking off the cover,
there will be a flat access plate you can open with a ratchet.  Use the same
procedure for this box as outlined in the small distribution box description.

Flat Peg Boxes:  Flat Peg boxes are frequently found behind grocery stores,
shopettes, and other businesses.  Sometimes they can be found in an office
phone room or in the back halls of shopping malls.  They are typically big,
square boxes mounted to a wall and are opened by a handle on a hinged door.
Sometimes, they are mounted away from a building.  We've seen some that are
double sided and require a ratchet to open.  Inside, the terminals will be
grouped in approx. 10 X 3 inch columns.  The terminals are long flat pegs.
There are four terminals per row.  It is sometimes difficult to hook up to a
line since the terminals are so close together, but you'll get the hang of
it after a few tries.

Large Boxes:  These boxes sometimes contain hundreds of phone lines.  They are
------------  found along busy streets and in business areas or apartment
complexes.  You'll need a ratchet to open one.

Wire Box:  The wire box is about three feet tall and has two doors opened by
one latch.  The wires lead into long, plastic, rectangular grouping stations.
There should be a tool attached by two screws to the side of a door.  Connect
your phone clips to these screws.  Now connect the tool to a plastic grouping
station.  If you connect the tool correctly, you will be on a line.
The bes contained in a single grouping station.

Terminal Boxes:  In our opinion, the terminal box is the king of boxes.  A
single box may contain up to eight hundred lines.  You can't miss these boxes
because of their size.  They stand at least four feet tall and have the
characteristic light green color of most boxes.  After opening a box, you will
see many red and white numbered terminals pairs on each side.  On the inside of
each door, there are two screws to connect your test phone to.  Leading out
from the screws is a double current alligator clip that can easily connect to
any pair of terminals.  This easy connection tool makes this the most
convenient box to use, and the most profitable.

Helpful Tips:  Now that you know how most major boxes work, you'll be able to
-------------  figure out how other boxes work.  By now we're sure you have
thought of some interesting things to do with boxes.  Here are some tips you
might find helpful.

The Perfect Box:  The most tedious step in field phreaking is finding "The
Perfect Box."  This box should be located away from streets and hidden from the
view of homes.  When working on this box, there should be no worry of being
caught or observed.  Finding this box might take quite a while, but don't give
up hope; it's well worth the time and effort.  Try looking around waterways
such as creeks, lakes, and ditches.  If you have easy access to wilderness
areas, such as the mountains, try looking for Perfect Boxes around there.

Beige Boxing:  We're not sure exactly who invented the beige box, but it can be
extremely useful for surveillance and blackmail purposes.  The only materials
you need for a beige box are two wires and your test phone.  Connect the wires
to the ring and tip of the line you want to tap.  Make sure your wires are
hidden, and lead them to your house or other location.  You then can connect
your phone to the wires and listen in on conversations or use their phone line
however you want.  Make sure that you don't use a boxed line when the victim
is likely to pick up his phone and hear you.

Safety Tips:

o  Well, first of all, be extremely careful when choosing a box to work on.
   Two of us got arrested for using the wrong box at the wrong time.  Make
   sure that nobody will see you when you're working on it, because you're
   putting your record at risk.  Of course, if you're under 18, you don't have
   to worry quite as much, but going to court is not K-Rad.

o  Try wearing gloves when working on phone lines.  You don't want to get
   shocked or leave fingerprints around.

o  If you ever open a box that has huge cables in it, it's probably a power
   box.  The power box is usually dark green and stands a few feet in height.
   Don't even think of messing with one unless you want to risk having a
   painful death.  If you absolutely *must* disconnect someone's power, then
   use *EXTREME* caution when disconnecting the cable.  Wear heavy duty gloves,
   make sure that you aren't wet, and don't use metal tools.

o  Always look for your boxes at day, and work on them at night.

o  Have a getaway bike or car ready in case of an emergency.

o  If anyone catches you, act cool and calm.  You don't want to say "uh, well,
   umm...well I was just uh...," because that makes you look suspicious.
   *Always* have a story ready *before* you start opening boxes!  This has
   saved us a couple of times.

o  You might want to incorporate your fake I.D. card into the scheme so people
   think that you work for the phone company.  Remember, this won't work on
   telco employees.  Only attempt to fool average citizens.  If they call the
   cops or telco, take off.

   This concludes Manuscript III.  We described most of the major phone boxes
so that you'll be able to figure out how other boxes work.

  The zapper gun is kinda like a commercial stun gun.  It is not as
powerful, and is mainly used to piss people off, not to put them down.
It will scorch skin very painfully, if applied.  Total cost for it is
around $20-$25, and it is a fun thing to make if yer kinda bored.
  If you don't know what a capaciter is, read no further, go find out
what one is/what one looks like, then come back.  Anyway, materials
are:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Qty           Description                        Approx price
--------------------------------------------------------------------
01       Disposable Fugi-Film FLASH camera        $15+TaX
01       Small-Mid radio shack projekt BoX        $2-$3 or so..
02       Dry wall nails                           10-20 cents
01       Radio Shack SPST Push Button             $1.50
01       1 Alkeline AA battery                    $0.50
--------------------------------------------------------------------
           This is to make a fairly nice version.
           For the raw, crappy version, all you
           need is the camera.  I won't even go
           into details on making it, you can
           figure it out for yerself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Okay.  Get the camera.  If you want, take some pictures.  ALL OF THEM,
or none of them.  Cause if you don't take all, you'll ruin the film..
Now, when yer ready, first, rip off the cardboard.  You'll have a plastic
box.  Open it up, as well as you can.  Be very careful not to damage the
circuit board, wires, flash, etc.  Once it's open, discard the plastic
case, and the film.  Now, looking at the circuit board, one can see
a fairly empty space.  Rite in the middle of it, will be 2 small copper
"plates."  Soldier your button to this place.  YOu may also remove the
flash at this time, as it will be shortly rendered useless.  Also, you will
notice two protrusions of copper strip.  Pull 'em off, and MAKE SURE they
aren't touching when you finish, cause it will ruin the gun.  Next, put
the circuit board in the project box.  Drill one hole so you can see the
LED.  THis will tell you when the gun is ready to FIRE!  (When the LED
flashes).  Next, line up approx where you want your two tips.  Line up
the capaciter with this.  Drill holes.  Next, drill one last hole where
you want the button.  Now, remove the generic AA battery in the camera,
replace it with your hi-quality Alkeline AA battery.  Now, stick the nails
in, and soldier them via wires to the two capaciter leads.  Seal them in
place with either expoxy or hot glue.  Now, wire up your button, and stik
the LED in the hole you made for it.  CLose up the box.  Your gun is made..
Just push the button, holding down for apporx 2 seconds until the lite
flashs, and touch whatever you want to SHOCK.  This gun is semi-lame, but
is also fun, and good for boredom..Have PhUn!!

Ok...I was reading a little of Phrack 42...in the first part of the issue I
read this short post on turning traffic lights to green on your side....
I'm here to tell that fucker that you cannot do that anymore... Maybe where
he lives you can...but not in Colorado.....he must have had an old system.
Now i'm sure there are a few old lights around 303 that can still be used that
way but...the metro are is not possible....i'll explain:

There are three different ways to change a stoplight in your direction to
green.

1) Manually Activated Devices:
Traffic conroll devices of this type operate by a switch that is manually held
until a Fire Engine or Ambulace clears the intersection. This switch can be
set up on an automatic timer that iterrupts traffic flow until the apparatus
responds, thens turns the light cycle back to normal.

2) Siren Activated Devices:
The siren of the Apparatus or Police Unit activates this traffic controll
device. A sound pick-up unit is located at each MAJOR intersection. This unit
filters out all other noise except the siren and sends a signal to the traffic
light selector in the control box. The traffic light selector holds the
yellow light for a few seconds (to let cross-traffic pass through) and then
switches to red..which flashes at double the normal rate.

Alot of people think  there car horn will set some of these off....no! Not
true!

3) Light Activated Devices: (This is the one that d00d talked about in Phrack)
This type of traffic controll device is activated by a Pulseating, High-
Intensity Stobe light that sends a signal to a detector located at each major
intersection. This dector holds the light green...if it happends to be green
when your going through it, or speeds up the normal cycle to green in the
direction of travel...(note: This means there is a RED light on three sides
and GREEN only on yours). There is an indicating light located next to the
light detector, assuring the driver that the traffic signal is in controll
by the stobe light.

Ok...The name of the stobe light system is called an OPTICOM. The key word in
the upper paragraph was "HIGH-INTENSITY"...normal car do not have high
intensity lights...even when you put your brights on. The OPTICOM flashes at
over 14 times a second...it almost looks like a regular solid light..but nope.
If you guys don't know what i'm talking about...next time you see a Fire Truck
running with lights and siren...look at the top of the engine and you'll see
it flashing away...actually..I think it's the most noticable thing....

Note: Police cars do not have these on them....and only some Ambulances.
The reason Cops don't have them is because they have a car that is easier to
manuver through other cars and intersections. But a fire enigine..with alot
of water and very heavy can't turn on a dime...you'll be screwed in a second!
So thats why Fire trucks have them and cops don't. SOme ambulances do...so
keep an EYE out for it.
