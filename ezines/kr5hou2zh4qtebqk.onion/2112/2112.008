Forward

  It was in August of 1994 that I started college at the 
University of North Texas and met Jeff and his host of the 
psychotically Christian.  I know they meant well, but the 
more I was around the religious, the more I began to 
understand why Nietzsche said, "After coming in contact with 
a religious man, I always feel I must wash my hands."  
Interestingly enough, I too was once one of these terrorist 
evangelicals many years ago.
  But it did start me thinking.  Who is the supreme being?  
Where do I fit into the grand scheme of things?  Does life 
matter?  Well, not if you consult Morrisey.  But hey, what 
do you expect to get from some shallow has-been who has 
long outlived his talents and usefulness and spends his days 
pondering, "What aspect of manic depression have I not 
totally manipulated into poetic bullshit and put in lyric 
form so the music-going teens of the world will spend their 
hard-earned cash to become more and more depressed while I 
get richer but pretend all that matters is their love?"
  But I digress.
  I decided to spend many a month on a spiritual pilgrimage 
that would lead me to vast, sorrow-drenched land in the 
distant East where only nature's secrets could be unfolded 
in snow-capped mountains by men so at peace with themselves 
it seemed all creation would bend if they merely asked 
politely.  But then I realized that too was a bunch of 
poetic bullshit and would only occur in movies like "The 
Razor's Edge", so I stayed in my dorm and finished that 
alter to David Lynch I'd been meaning to build for a few 
years now.
  Of course, I finally realized what needed to be done.  It 
took weeks, and I had to bribe a few influential people in 
the spiritual hierarchy, but I got a dinner appointment with 
the Big Guy himself.
  That's right.
  God.
  I had a dinner date with the *real* All-Father himself.  
  The Maker.
  The Father.  
  Mr. Old-Testament-Hell-Fire-New-Testament-Child-Hugger 
himself.
  Part of the deal was I could tape record the conversation, 
and He consented.
  So here it is, for you, a transcript of my dinner with God.

*********

Date: Monday, December 19, 1994
Time: 6:43 PM
Place: Lotus, a Chinese restaurant off of Brown Trail near 
       highway 360, Bedford, Texas

<TAPE STARTS>

NEE: Ah, Mr. Jehovah I presume. <bows>
GOD: What gave me away?  The flowing robes or the eternal 
     light?
NEE: Shoes.  I always thought you'd wear loafers.
GOD: They were on sale.

<Waiter appears>

GOD: I'll have sweet and sour pork with a side order of rice 
     and egg rolls.  Water to drink, please.
NEE: Just some sweet and sour soup.  Thanks.

<Waiter bows and leaves>

GOD: <in displeased tone> I tell you, these places aren't 
     like they used to be.  I remember back in the old day 
     in China.  I'd occasionally spend a summer or so with a 
     friend of mine in the Orient and we'd go to these 
     little dives all the time.  Best one was a tiny out-of- 
     the-way shack in Hong Kong, run by some guy named Yaun.
     Served wonderful opium dumplings. <makes smacking sound 
     with lips>
NEE: Opium?  Opium was a highly addictive drug imported by 
     the English to make the Chinese more docile and easier 
     to conquer and dominate.
     It destroyed countless lives, not to mention a nation.  
     Because of it, the country would later go through a 
     spiral of changing hands until the American government 
     stepped in and carved it up among the European powers 
     like a Thanksgiving Turkey, and you liked that?

<silence>

GOD: I always thought you were a dick.
NEE: I always thought you were a black lesbian and active 
     member of NOW.  I guess we're both a bit let down.  
     Perhaps you could tell me a bit about Heaven.
GOD: Like?
NEE: Well, is it true how the Bible described it?  Streets 
     of gold?  Flocks of angels and mortal souls bowing 
     before your throne, praising your great power and being 
     with song and music?
GOD: <laughs> Oh that. No, no. Nothing at all. You see, John 
     the Apostle, well, he was always a bit upset because in 
     the missionary/martyr business, you really don't get a 
     lot of chances to get creative.  In reality, it's full 
     of paperwork and public speeches and begging nation 
     powers not to ravage the women of your religion and 
     hurl the children to hungry lions.  And then you've got 
     to convince the people who *are* Christian not to 
     convert back to their heathenish ways because of a few 
     minor slaughters of faith's leaders by Romans and 
     what-not.
NEE: I can see how that would put a damper on a following.
GOD: You're telling me.  Anyway, when John got around to 
     the book of Revelations, I could tell John was tired 
     and upset.  Hey, who could blame the guy?  The Roman 
     government was about to have him publicly executed for 
     rebellion and conspiracy.  So I took him aside, and 
     said, `Look, John-John,' that's what I called him,
     'John-John, you've had a bad week, so know what I'm 
     going to do for you?' and he says to me, `Get me the 
     fuck out of here?' and I laugh because I know he was 
     willing to lay his life down for me.
NEE: Willing to and wanting to are two different things.
GOD: <Annoyed> Hey, who's telling the story here?  Me or 
     you? <calm again>  As I was saying.  I looks at John 
     and go, `Even better.  I'm going to let you write the 
     last part of the Bible.'  Know what he says to me?  
     `Well whoop-de-shit, Mr. Supreme Being.' 
     That John-John.  Such a card.  Well, like I says, he 
     was a-writing away, and I think his pent-up wants to be 
     artistic finally just popped out.  He originally wanted 
     to be a choreographer, you know.
NEE: Really?
GOD: Yeah, but times were tough back then and most dancers 
     did it in the buff, and the Pharisees and Scribes 
     usually hung their carcasses up by their genitals for 
     the public to see.  So, John-John sort of embellished 
     the truth a bit.  Very poetic, even brought a tear to 
     my eye.
NEE: So, what you're saying is John the Evangelist basically 
     lied through his teeth about Heaven.
GOD: Sort of.
NEE: What's Heaven like?
GOD: Pueblo.

<pause>

NEE: Pueblo?  Like, you mean Pueblo, Colorado?
GOD: Yes.  A lot.  But not as many trees.  And a bit noisier.
NEE: <disappointed> Uh-huh.  No singing angels?
GOD: Um, that's another thing.  No angels.
NEE: What?!
GOD: They're, uh, sort of.. well.. dead.
NEE: <excitedly> Dead?  As in gone? Extinct?  Fineto?  Are 
     you trying to tell me the mythical and mystical winged 
     race which was once the entire army of the Lord God 
     Almighty is dead?
GOD: Pretty much.
NEE: Oh Christ.  This ought to be good.
GOD: Long story.  What it breaks down to is they wanted a 
     pay raise, I check the records and it turns out not a 
     winged one of them has done dick since a little before 
     the French Revolution. Boy, should've nipped that in 
     the bud.  Maybe those artsy jerks wouldn't act so 
     snooty, and -
NEE: <impatient> The angels.
GOD: Oh. I just killed them.
NEE: Well, how de-romanticizing of you.  Is there anything 
     at all in the Bible that *is* true?
GOD: Mary was a virgin.
NEE: <sigh of relief> Well, at least we can rest assured 
     that the most amazing tale in the Bible is true.  How 
     did a virgin give birth -
GOD: No, you misunderstand.  She was a virgin, just not then.
NEE: I don't like where this is going.

<waiter appears with food>
<God lights up a cigar>

WAITER: I'm very sorry, Sir, but you are in the "No Smoking" 
        area.

<God turns the waiter into a tree>

NEE: Was that necessary?
GOD: I'm the Supreme One.  I'll decide what's necessary.
NEE: <clears throat> Well then.  Let's see.  Here's a 
     question I'm sure many people have on their minds.  How 
     is your relationship with Satan?
GOD: <in between chewing> Hardly knew him.
NEE: You've never met your greatest adversary?  I don't 
     understand.
GOD: <swallows> Well, kid, you gotta stop and think.  A lot 
     has changed in the past two-thousand years.  I'll start 
     from the beginning.  Satan, he was Saint Lucifer back 
     then, he wanted to break out on his own... build 
     himself up a small empire and start a business to be 
     proud of.  Originally, he wanted to run a meat packing 
     industry.
NEE: Not very high aspirations.
GOD: <chewing again> You're telling me.  But I said, `Well, 
     if that's what you want, go to it.'  Turns out meat 
     packing don't pay off so good after all, but the soul 
     business did.
NEE: <interested> I've always wondered what profit could be 
     in the soul industry.  What'd he do with the ones he 
     claimed?
GOD: Oh, well, it all goes back to when he got hooked up 
     with that Sidhartha character.
NEE: Buddha?
GOD: Whatever.  A lot of people don't realize that Nirvana 
     state crap isn't anything more than a business.  Sort 
     of like accountants.  Your payment is prayer and 
     devotion, and for the payment you get in your next life 
     a better soul, or so you'd think.  What they really do 
     is take a small bit of your personality, take your 
     body, re-tune it, and take a better and stronger soul 
     purchased from Lucifer.
NEE: Let me see if I understand you correctly.  You are 
     trying to tell me the entire Buddhist heirarchy is a 
     capitalist organization, and the Prince of Darkness is 
     one of their stooges?
GOD: Was.  A few years ago, they did some budget cuts and 
     cancelled their contract.  Basically, they cut him out 
     and now collect the souls themselves.  Last I heard, 
     Satan was the night manager in a Wal-Mart in Louisiana.
NEE: On to something else.  What is your feelings about the 
     countless thousands Christianity has slaughtered in 
     your name?
GOD: <nervous> I'm not sure what you are referring to.
NEE: Allow me to elaborate.  The Crusades.  I'm sure you 
     remember that little embarrassing incident where your 
     people attempted to run into the Holy Land and reclaim 
     it from the `heathen' Muslims.
GOD: We all make mistakes.
NEE: Yes.  Hold that thought.  Or how about the Spanish 
     Inquisition?  Or maybe the hundred of thousands who 
     were burnt at the stake for witchcraft over the 
     centuries?  Remember the Joan of Ark barbecue?  Nice 
     payment for a job well done.  How could you allow all
     these things to happen by your people and in your name?
GOD: <nervous again> So I took a nap for a few centuries.  
     Running all creation takes a lot out of a guy.
NEE: Enough of this.  On to modern issues.  The United 
     States seems to be wanting to return to its more 
     `traditional Christian' values in hopes of restoring 
     the nation to the greatness it once knew.  This means a 
     possible resurgence into the Church.  Do you have any 
     plans on trying to pull in new followers?
GOD: <proudly> Yes, actually.  I've consulted with a few 
     people in my public relations department, and we've 
     decided it's high time I let the people know I'm still 
     watching by sending them signs of my being.
NEE: <excitedly> Really?  In Old or New Testament style?  
     You know, are you going to go back to the old wrathful 
     deity schtick or revive the kind, caring tree-hugger 
     miracle worker bit?
GOD: <slight pause> Actually, I'd sort of planned on 
     starting out a bit small and working my way up to 
     miracles and such.
NEE: Working your way up?
GOD: Yes.
NEE: Like how?
GOD: Well, first thing, I plan on sending out Christmas 
     cards.

<pause>

NEE: That's it?
GOD: <shuffles a bit> They're very nice Christmas cards.  
     See?  They're `Precious Moments'.
NEE: That's it?  Do these cards heal with a touch to your 
     signature?
GOD: I'm not really going to sign all of them.  That would 
     take forever.  I've hired secretaries to do that.
NEE: Well... great.
GOD: Then I thought I'd make a few public appearances at the 
     openings of art exhibits or appear in malls for Bible 
     autograph sessions.
NEE: As if you wrote it.
GOD: <defensively> I might as well have.  I told what should 
     be written.
NEE: So it breaks down to this.  You, the One who Made All, 
     are going to let the people known you are back by 
     appearing in malls and kissing ass.
GOD: I was thinking more around the lines of babies.
NEE: Why no big show, God?  Why not heal some lepers?  Cure 
     world hunger?  End the AIDS epidemic?  Don't you think 
     that would be a lot more likely to get the people's 
     attention?
GOD: I don't want to startle them.  I mean, it might not be 
     the right time to start the miracles.  I need to build 
     up a public image first.  Otherwise, I'll probably just 
     end up on Oprah.
NEE: You're a fraud.
GOD: Am not.

<Second waiter comes with check>

GOD: <hesitates> Well?  Are you going to pay that or what?
