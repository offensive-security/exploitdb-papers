  Really, now, the evening had bad juju from the beginning.  
I think we all felt it.  Nothing ominous in the Shakespearean 
way, actually, like horses chewing their fucking legs off, or 
snakes hiding in the ground and crazy shit like that.. 
  But.. 
  It was just ominous, that's all.

  I can't even fucking remember what we were doing at first, 
but I do know that we went to Blockbuster to get some movies.  
I also remember that as I write this, the fucking movies are 
due.  But we searched Blockbuster for a good half hour before 
we found anything.  Sirens we chose first, because Elle 
MacPherson takes her clothes off in it.  The other one was 
called... I dunno, Mobsters, or some shit like that, and it 
had Christian Slater in it and Richard Greico.  We wanted to 
get Faces of Death but they didn't carry that series.  
  I think we drove around for a while before we decided that 
we wanted to eat.. and we went to a pizza place called Papa 
John's..  they have these really kickass breadsticks, you 
know.  I mean, they are so fucking good that for a week 
during Christmas vacation I had nothing to eat but these 
breadsticks.  They're that good.  And they also come with 
this "Special Garlic Sauce," which is really something along 
the lines of a psychotic Crisco-Garlic mixture.
  That fucking garlic sauce was probably what fucked the 
whole evening up, because it made everyone feel like shit.  
We were all sitting around, talking about how we wanted to 
puke... and then, Leo, my chihauhau, came up stuck his head 
in the "Special Garlic Containers" and drank it like it was
fucking Kool-Aid.  I mean, he just swilled that shit down.  
And we all just sat there talking about how now we wanted to 
puke even more.
  That's when we decided to leave the house.  It was 12:30, 
probably, and the night was still young and we all wanted to 
do something.  "Something," when Justin's involved, usually 
means fire, destruction, and pestilence, plus equal parts 
gasoline and firecrackers.  That night, though, we didn't have 
any firecrackers.
  So here I am, getting in the car with this fucking "Special 
Garlic Buzz", my head spinning and shit... 
  I had told them,"Look, we're not going anywhere in my car.  
I hate it and it's a piece of shit."  Somehow, that's where 
we ended up anyway, sitting in that fucking car.  You know 
what?  That fucking car is tilted.  I noticed that in the 
parking garage yesterday.  See, parking garage floors are 
slanted perpindicularly from the parking spaces, so the 
bottom of the car should be parallel with the ground.  But 
my car, damn that piece of shit, it's fucking even.  
Goddamit.  I hate that fucking car.
  So we were sitting in the car, and we drove down the street 
to get some gas in one of those red plastic gas canisters, 
with the yellow spouts.  That was mine.  I think Justin put 
Exxon Premium in it, $2.00 worth.
  Nirvana was in the stereo, "Bleach."
        
  We found this little shack at a baseball field.  It was one 
of those wooden shacks that the scorers sit in when a game 
was going on, but since it was 1:00 in the morning, there 
wasn't a game going on and there wasn't anyone in it.  We had 
gone to the field to look for bottles, to make firebombs with,
but, hey, there was this convenient fire hazard sitting there 
and we burned it down.
  No, actually, I don't know if it burned down, per se, but 
when we left, it was quite a healthy little campfire.  So it's 
probably charcoal briquettes by now.
  I think when we were driving off, Kurt Cobain was howling 
out a song called "Blew."  Nirvana is some great fire music.
  I have absolutely no grasp of the amount of time that 
passed at this point.  We drove around for an absolutely 
indeterminate amount of time.

  The occupants of my car were in a quandry.  They wanted to 
burn down something important, apparently, but they didn't 
want to kill anyone.  A truly paradoxical situation to me.  
I had asked them if it would make them juice their pants if 
someone can running out of a house with their fucking head 
on fire.. they said something, but I can't remember what.  
Justin was suggesting knocking on doors to see who was home, 
and then burning down the ones that didn't have anyone in 
it.  We pointed out to him that this was hardly practical at 
1:30 in the morning.

  It was around this time when we stumbled across a house.  
It seemed to call to us...  
  Anyway... It was the only edifice within 1000 fucking 
yards.
  Isolated.  Off on the other side of the road was a 
railroad... hmmm... what the fuck is that called?  It was a 
whole bunch of tracks and shit, and a bunch of diesel 
engines, and they were hooking up cars to make a train.  
That was on the far side of the street.  The road hooked 
down towards this bridge, and it was completely pitch black, 
with no street lights.  It was perfect.
  We stopped and looked at the house for a minute.  I mean, 
there had to be something amiss here.  There was no way for 
a house to be that perfect.
  But it was.  Andre had filled a forty bottle... it was that 
malt liquor with the bull on it... with gasoline, and there 
was a roll of newspaper sticking out of it that served as a 
wick (and had probably served as a funnel, as well).  
Sicophants that we are, we made sure we through a rock 
through the window before we gave the house last rites, so 
any occupants had time to turn on the lights and scare us 
off.
  Strangely enough, the caution was unwarranted as the 
house had one of those notices that means the house is 
condemned on the door.  It said it was a class 
something-or-other misdemeanor to enter it.  Well, like I 
said, we didn't plan to enter it, we just wanted to torch 
it.
  So, Andre or Justin or whoever it was threw the bottle 
through the window and suddenly this house was on fire.  We 
all laughed like loons and drove off...
  But we came back, and decided it wasn't burning good 
enough, and we all went up and looked at the house.  It was 
then that we noticed it had the notice on the door.  It was 
then that we also noticed all the junk and shit on the 
floor.  So Justin threw gas on the side of the building, which 
caught fire immediately, and ran in weird patterns in the 
yard trailing the gas until the whole fucking yard was 
burning like a motherfucker.  And he didn't stop there, 
either.  He ran towards the us, still trailing the gas, and 
leapt into the car... the fire was right there, practically 
blistering my paint... and I threw the car into 4 different 
(and incorrect gears) before I finally got it into drive and 
left.  As we drove by, I saw that the ceiling of the house 
was afire, it would be mere moments before the second floor 
caught.
  That was when Andre started howling something at the 
trains... I don't remember what he said, but it was 
something pretty weird.  As we rounded the curve past the 
house, we saw this guy walking along the road in a jogger's
suit... then he saw the fire and broke into a sprint towards 
it.
        
  We proceeded to drive around for yet another indeterminate 
period of time, during which we debated the merits of either 
going home or "getting" a car.  They were as fickle about 
cars as shoppers.  Not that one, it wasn't expensive 
enough... not this one, it's too bright around here.
  It seemed like forever until they finally found one they 
wanted.  It was brand new... still had the dealer's plates 
on it, for Christ's sake.  It was mint green, I believe.  
It's black now.
  Justin and Andre were going to "get" it... I was in the car, 
with Shane.
  They had this big ass rock, probably about 5 pounds, and 
they kept trying to break the passenger window with it.  
They tried 3 or 4 times before they finally broke it, and I 
was getting really antsy.  I just had a bad feeling.  I kept 
seeing that jogger with no head, just one of those flashing 
blue police bubbles on his shoulders.
  This is where everything just fritzed out.  They dumped 
gasoline in the window, on the car, everywhere, and Andre lit 
it with a rolled up piece of paper.  Then, I don't know what 
happened but in a span of about 2 seconds the street around 
them was on fire... me and Shane kept screaming,"Come on!  
Shit!  Come on!"  We just fucking freaked out... but Justin's 
legs were on fire, so I guess he had a problem "Coming on."  
There was gasoline flying everywhere, I guess, because 2 
other cars suddenly went up in flame.  The whole street
was on fire, too, all the way across.  To make matters 
worse, a fucking car stopped at the stop sign not twenty 
feet from all that shit... and it was like fucking daytime 
with all that fire.
  Multitudes of expletives were howled at this point, 
including, "Holy Fuck, he's on FIRE!!" from myself, and 
"Fucking shit!" from Shane, and I think something like 
"AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaAAAAAHH!!" from Justin... I don't even know.
But I do remember he tried to stop, drop, and roll, which 
was roughly as effective as Reaganomics but much more 
visually stimulating, not meaning anything bad about 
Reagan, I love him like my own fucking dad...
  Shane's amazingly verbose and moving account of this moment 
later was as follows: "I just kept thinking of that song by 
REM... 'Everybody Hurts'."
  I remember watching them try to beat the flames off... it 
was almost like some kind of fucking trance, me and Shane 
sitting in the car... I don't know if I said anything.  
Justin, amazingly enough, had the presence of mind to bend 
down and untie his shoes (which were on fire), kick them 
off, pull his pants off.  This was in the middle of an 
enormous conflagration in the street, and meanwhile yet 
another vehicle had driven by the stop sign twenty feet from 
the action.
  And suddenly, it was over.  Justin had the pants off, and 
the shoes, and the fire on his person was out... he and Andre 
sprinted to the car, realized that they had left Justin's 
wallet in the street, went back to get it, and then we were 
off... the whole mess flaming behind.
  I was yelling at Justin... "You alright, man?!  You 
alright?!"
  "Fuck NO!.. I'm fucking BURNED!!"
  There was this smell, too.  Oh, fuck, the smell.  My car 
still smells... It was kind of like bacon, but also smelled
like burnt hair.  Oh, shit, it reeked.

  The car rocketed (well, not rocketed, exactly... ricketed, 
maybe) through the streets... Justin's leg was sticking out of 
the window, and this, this is what got me, it was making 
this whistling, sizzly noise.  That was the most fucked up 
ass noise I've ever heard in my life.  And, get this, as
we drove over the bridge overlooking the house we burned, 
Justin was howling for us to look at all the fucking 
firetrucks...  that's the real kicker.
  He's got this fucking 3rd degree burn on his leg, and he 
wants to see the fucking house.
  I just asked him what he was thinking when he was on fire.  
He says that he was thinking that he needed to take his 
pants off.
  That kind of shows you his clarity of thinking.  Fuck, I 
don't know.

  When we got back to the house, he limped back in and got 
in the tub, and we ran cold water over his legs and hands.  
That was kind of weird, too, because we were all sitting 
there watching him in the tub.  We kept asking, "You 
alright, man, you alright?", but he was just sitting there 
in agony.
  Also, my mom was in the room right next to the bathroom, 
sleeping, so I was all trying to get them to be quiet.  It 
was kind of hard, though, because there was this burnt 
bacony smell and that burnt hair smell, and we were all 
kind of feeling that "Special Garlic Puke" coming up on us.  
Justin's hair was singed on the top and sides, his eyelashes 
were singed, and all this skin and shit was falling out in 
the fucking tub.  He kept saying how much it hurt and shit.
  Then we called Ask-A-Nurse.  This bitch that worked 
there, she was probably a janitor or something, she just  
started fucking with me.
  "Ask-A-Nurse."
  "Yeah, a friend of mine is burned."
  "What's your name, sir?"
  I answered.  Stupid of me.
  "And who is the call regarding?"
  "Uh.. huh.. Look, I just wanna know some stuff about burns, 
what do you need his name for?"
  "Sir, we need the person's name..."
  I muted the phone... to Andre and Shane: "What the fuck 
am I supposed to tell her...?  I can't give her his fucking 
name."  Unmuted... "Look, I just have some questions. 
Are you gonna answer them or not?"
  "I can't answer them without a..."
  "Fuck this shit...<click>"
  It got really fucked up then, because we kept calling 
around trying to find out if Justin would die if we didn't 
take him to the emergency room, and it was like the 
Fucking Quest for the Holy Grail because no one would give 
us straight answers.  Finally, Shane and Andre went into my 
room and started playing FIFA Soccer on the Sega Genesis 
and shit.
  I didn't know what to do.  Justin had picked up the phone
and was talking to different emergency room motherfuckers
who were all fucking him around.  Shane and Andre used their
own unique coping techniques by playing Sega like fiends,
and I was shitting my pants hoping my mother wouldn't come
into the bathroom and see Justin on the phone with his leg
looking like a hunk of roasted chicken.
  I think sometime around 3:30 Justin found this nurse that
would tell him about burns, told her some story about spilling
lighter fluid on his leg and not having money for an emergency
room visit, something like that.  I was sitting on the toilet,
freaked out of my fucking mind.  Oh, yeah, and a little bit
before, Shane and Andre had left to go get bandages and anti-
septics.  I had forgotten about that.
  See, Justin was talking to the nurse, and the other two
came back with peroxide, Bactine, and a fuckload of bandages.
They said that they got all the shit at Eckerds, and that the
stupidass bitch that was behind the counter wouldn't help them,
so they took their shit and left.  It was just a criminal 
night, apparently.
  Probably about 4:00, Justin's lips started turning blue from 
sitting in the cold water for so long, and we had to yell at 
him and shit before he'd get out.  I told him if he didn't get 
out, we really would have to go to the hospital for fucking 
hypothermia as well as burns.  His forehead was real clammy 
and shit... fucking scary.
  He wouldn't let us bandage him up, either.  We tried.  
Several times.  He just yelled about how much it hurt and all 
this other shit, and finally ended up on the couch with a bowl 
of ice water for his hands and cold towels draped over his legs.
  This is where I started to get kinda pissed.  There was no 
way we could be there when my mom woke up that morning.  I 
mean, if she saw his leg, we were fucked because there wasn't 
any way to hide it.  We couldn't stay there.  But every time I 
asked what we were going to do, the whole fucking issue was 
dropped.  So I ended up staying up the remainder of the 
morning while everyone else slept.

  I just called Justin.  He says that he stayed home from 
school today to go to the doctor...  told his parents that he 
was making a bonfire at the lake and caught his pants on fire. 
Kinda makes all our efforts worthless, I think.  I mean, I 
stole him anti-biotics, Eric stole him pain killers, we'd been 
fucking bandaging him up all the time and shit.  He was 
through the worst of it... I mean, what can the goddamned 
doctor do that we can't?

  Besides, can that fucking doctor make a firebomb?
