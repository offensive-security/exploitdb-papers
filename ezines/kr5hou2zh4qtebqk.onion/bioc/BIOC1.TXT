***************************************

Revised:  18-JUL-84

PREFACE:
--------

In this course, I plan to cover as much material as possible relating to tele-
communications.  First, in the syllabus are the long-distance services, which
is the topic of part I. In future issues, such subjects as The Network,
colored boxes, telephone electronics, central office equipment, operators,
special #'s, and much, much more will be covered.


LONG-DISTANCE SERVICES:
-----------------------

In an attempt to offer lower prices, alternatives to Bell have been set up.
Services such as Sprint, Metrofone, ITT, MCI, Travelnet, and many others are
all familiar to us.  These services are known as Specialized Common Carriers
(SCC's) or Other Common Carriers (OCC's). [Don't confused this with Switching
Control Center, also known as SCC]

The basis of all these services are that they own their own switching
equipment.  First, we will look at those services which use a local dial-up.
The principle of these are: 1) You dial the local #. 2) When it picks up you
get a 2nd dial tone, you then enter a code. 3) You then enter the destination
# & whalla, you're connected--a free call!

Next, we will look at several of the
services:

SPRINT:
-------

Sprint, also known as SPC, was one of the first LD services.

Many boards contain SPC #'s and I plan to include a list of them as an
appendix to this course so you can find your local #.

The codes for SPC are 8 digits long.  SPC is not considered safe, since many
people have been busted on it!  It is common knowledge that Sprint has
declared war on phone phreaks.  So, fight back (with care)!

 {914 dial-up--> (914) 997-1616}


METROFONE:
----------

Metrofone, owned by Western Union, is very popular among phone phreaks due to
the large abundance of codes and it (at the time of this writing) is
considered fairly safe.

Recently (7/84), Metrofone has allegedly been placing "trap codes" on BBS's
which are being traced.  I suggest that you hack your own for safety purposes.

The code is 6 digits long.

To find out the local dial-up for your area, just call (800) 325-1403 and ask
the "nice lady" for the # for your area.

    FORMAT: At tone--> code+area code
            (NPA)+destination #

NOTE:  NPA & A/C are abbreviations for
       area code.


ITT:
----

ITT is a little different in that upon hearing the dial tone after calling the
local access #, you enter the a/c and then the #.  You will then hear a short
tone, you then immediately enter your 7 digit access code.

{dial-ups:(212)248-0151, (914)997-8576}

    FORMAT:  At tone, destination # + 7
             digit access code.


MCI:
----

MCI has dial-ups in most areas but the codes are not interchangable (ie, a
code that works for the New York dial-up will NOT work for the Boston
dial-up).

    FORMAT:  At tone, 5 digit access
             code + destination #.


MCI CREDIT CARD (MCI CC):
-------------------------

This MCI service also known as MCI Execunet, is for people who travel alot
(ie, business pigs) & need a code that works in several places.  Therefore,
the codes on this system are interchangable throughout the dial-ups unlike the
regular MCI service.

    FORMAT:  At tone, 7 digit access
             code + destination #.

{212 dial-up: 248-0151}


NOTE: You can usually call up the companies customer service #, and say you
just moved or that you are traveling and ask for the access # for your area
code.  To find out the customer service # call dir. asst. at (800) 555- 1212.


==============
=950 Exchange=
==============


The 950 exchange is a nationwide access exchange, in most areas, that includes
several SCC's.  All services on this exchange are considered dangerous due to
the fact that they have the ability to trace.

The currently working numbers in many metropolitan areas in the US are:

     950-1000  SPC (Sprint)
        -1022  MCI Execunet
        -1033  US Telephone
        -1044  AllNet
        -1066  Lexitel
        -1088  Skyline

This exchange will probably be phased out when customers choose their LD
carrier as a result of "equal access."



SKYLINE:
--------

SBS Skyline is a new service owned by IBM, Comsat and AEtna.  It has the same
local access # across the country: 950-1088.  It is supposed to have 6
(possibly 8) digit codes and is alleged to be very dangerous.

Most of the services in 950 have crystal clear connections.

===============
=Calling Cards=
===============


Calling cards are Bell's version of Sprint, MCI, etc.  Calling cards are used
primarily from pay fones.  The format is:

NPA-NXX-XXXX-CCCC

NPA is usually the a/c of the billed # that the call is to be billed to.  This
may be replaced by a 3 digit RAO (Revenue Accounting Office) code in some
NPA's or a special billing number.

NXX-XXXX is the number that the call is to billed to.

CCCC is a checkcode (or PIN--Personal Identification Number) that adds the
security to Calling Cards.  The codes used to be predictable until 1983.  Now
CCCC appears to be sequentially generated so the codes cannot be calculated
from a formula!

The easiest way to find these codes are in a busy airport or college where
they are used alot.  Just get close and copy down someones code (if you are
that unscrupulous!)  Don't rip off poor people; go for the rich business pigs!

You usually call the operator to make a CC Call but on many fortress fones,
you can dial 0+the number you want to call and you will get a recording & tone
where you enter your calling card #.  By pressing the # sign (octothorpe)
after each call instead of hanging up, you can make many calls at once without
having to retype the CC # each time.  This is good for busy numbers.  Also, if
you want to call the # of the card, ie the billed #, you just have to enter
the last 4 digits of the CC # at the tone.

Now, suppose you do get a real operator.  Since mostly business people use
calling cards, it is suggested that you act a little like a business person,
ie, rushed, older, businesslike, and SLIGHTLY pissed at the operator (keyword:
SLIGHTLY).  All you have to tell her is the CC #.  If she asks for the # you
are calling from, tell her, but change the last digit or 2.  If she asks you
more questions, she is probably suspicious.  Hang up.  Although, you should
make up some answers to certain questions to satisfy the operator that you are
legit.  The most important thing you should know when making a CC call is the
area code and the city of the card.

Finally, in case the operator is listening, always talk businesslike for the
first few seconds until the operator clicks off [they have been known to
listen in on calls (understatement)].  Also, always use CC's from pay fones or
Charge-A-Call fones only!


CAUTION: All the CC codes are now rapidly checked due to CCIS (Common Channel
Inter-office Signaling) and ESS (Electronic Switching System) If you try to
hack CC codes you can be fairly sure that Bell Security (affectionately known
as the gestapo in the phreaking world) will get a message from the CO (Central
Office, ie, exchange)!


There is also an international code that is in the format of:

1A  NPA NXX XXXX 9

Where:  1A is a digit followed by a
        letter (check characters)

        NPA NXX XXXX is the # that the
        call is to billed to (same as
        above)

        9 is an check digit

The international code is used only when calling from a foreign country.

AT&T has just recently released real plastic calling cards with the domestic &
international codes printed on the front along with the persons name.  These
cards also have a magnetic strip on the back that can be read by their new
Calling Card fones that contain a built in CRT & will accept AT&T cards as
well as American Express.  These fones should be popping up in airports &
other places where large numbers of business pigs hang out.

==============
=800 Services=
==============


You are probably all familiar with WATS.  WATS #'s (Wide Area Telephone
Service, otherwise known as 800 #'s) are very popular due to the fact that
they are toll-free.  They often contain WATS extneders.  Extenders were
originally used by salesmen in the field who called up their company's 800 #
(INWATS #) and then used the company's low-priced OUTWATS line to make the
call.  This is cheaper to the company than using the Bell calling card which
has a surcharge.

On the original extenders there were no codes!  Companies soon realized that
their #'s were being used and added the present day security codes.  The
salesman would then dial the 800 number and enter the code (usually 4 digits),
he would then receive a second dial tone from the companies PBX (Private
Branch eXchange - their own switching equipment - ie, switchboard).  He would
then access the OUTWATS line by dialing 8 or 9 and then the #.  These codes
were originally hand-hacked, but some pioneer phreak (Capt.  Crunch) added an
interface to Charlie, his Apple ][ computer, which was capable of generating
DTMF tones (Dual-Tone-Multi -Frequency - ie, generic term for Touch -Tone
(TM)) and trying all the codes.  The only problem was that Ma Bell got
suspicious when they saw that someone called the Joe Blow Rubber Company 800 #
in California 4,568 times at 2 AM and each call lasted for only 1 second!



TRAVELNET:
----------

Travelnet is a service, owned by GM, that uses WATS as well as local access
#'s.

The 800 # is (800) 521-8400.

After the tone, enter the 8 digit code, if the code was right you'll get a
second tone, then enter the area code and number.

Travelnet is also unique in that it accepts voice recognition for those times
when touch-tone is not available (How convinient!).  If you don't do anything
after the tone, you will hear a voice that says, "authorization #, please."
You then say each digit SLOWLY.  It will beep after you say each digit.  After
each group of digits, it will repeat what you have said.  Say yes if it is
right, otherwise, say no.  If the authorization code is correct, it will say
thank you and it'll then ask for the destination #.  Follow the same procedure
as above.  The voice system is very user friendly and you should have no
problems with it.


TEL-TEC:
--------

TEL-TEC is at (800) 323-3026.  In my experiences, you usually get a very
shitty connection.  This I use for last resorts.

    FORMAT:  6 digit code + dest. #

Tel-Tex (for TX only):  (800) 432-2071


CAUTION:  Like the 950 exchange, 800
          numbers can be easily traced.
          This doesn't mean that they
          trace everything, though.

Others:
-------

There are many other 800 services and PBX's (such as the Dimension 2000 at
800-848-9000).  There is just not enough room to discuss them all.  As you
have probably noticed, I have posted no codes.  Check the phreak section of
various BBS's to find the latest codes or hack them yourself.  I suggest that
you don't use codes found on BBS's though since they may be traps!  Hand-hack
good possibilities or use a "smart" modem with a hacking program (contact your
local pirate).


HOW MA BELL CATCHES PHONE HACKERS:
----------------------------------

Besides suspicion and random checks, Ma Bell sets up "trap numbers".  Trap
numbers were set up on certain dial-ups such as Sprint, MCI, etc.  Whenever,
the dial-up is called a "trouble card" is dropped at the central office.  This
means that a record of the called #, the CALLERS #, and time are printed out.
These cards (or printouts in an ESS CO) are usually ignored unless SPC or
somebody detects fraud, ie, unauthorized use of a customers acct., then they
call Bell and find out the name and number and instantly nail the phreak who
made the call.  They will then either demand that you pay some enormous fee
and they'll forget the whole matter; give them info on other phreaks, boards,
etc.; or prosecute you on the federal rap of Theft of Communications service,
which carries fines of upto 10 years in jail and/or $10,000.  They usually
don't go for legal action first, though.  If you don't actually use any codes,
they can still nail you for harrassing fone calls.

"Trap & Trace" is another favorite of the gestapo.  With this method you
cannot hang up until the trace is completed!

Why does Bell help their competion?  Actually, it is rather simple.  People
were using Sprint to break into Bell's ESS computers.  Bell could only trace
the call back to Sprint.  So, Sprint helps Bell catch the people it wants and
visa-versa.  ("You rub my back and I'll rub yours" type of deal.)

By the way, trap numbers are also how Bell catches people who make harrasing
phone calls to private residences.

Also, certain Telco exchanges running ESS (see part IV) generate reports
called the "800 Exceptional Calling Report" which list people who have made
extensive or long calls to 800 #'s.  Since many people use legit 800's alot,
they also wind up on the list.  If Bell does have a certain problem with an
800 #, though, they just have to check their records.

If Bell has sufficient reason to suspect you of illegal activities, they may
put a pen register on your line to record EVERY single digit you dial along
with other pertinent information.

Finally, do not forget that these services have a copy of the number that you
called.  So, if a customer says he didn't call a certain #, they will usually
call up that # and try to find out who did call at that time.

So, to be safer on SPC, MCI, and others, follow the following suggestions:

1) Use a fortress fone (pay fone) whenever possible.  Although, they have been
know to stake out pay fones.  Just don't use the same fone over and over
again.  In other words, move around.

2) Only call institutional switchboards, business that have no record of your
call, and friends who are instant amnesiacs.

3) Try to keep all calls under 15 minutes when possible.

NOTE: No system is totally safe!  When I classify something as safe or
dangerous, that is just with respect to my opinion as well as that of several
other phreaks.  These opinions are based on how many people have been busted
on them, what type of equipment they are using, and inside information.  I
cannot possibly guarantee that you will or will not get caught.  Actually,
with CCIS and ESS nothing is really safe anymore.  Besides, what phun would
there be in life without risks!  Also, I have known people who used 800 #'s &
SCC's for several years daily with no problems...I also know people who used a
system for a week and were busted!



Coming soon:
------------

In Part II, we will look at the special Bell numbers such as CN/A, ATT
Newslines, loops, ANI, ringback, and 99XX scanning.

Until next time, I would like to leave you with a quote from The Magician:

"Many people think of phone phreaks as slime, out to rip off Bell for all she
is worth.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  Granted, there are some
who get their kicks just by making free calls, however they are not true phone
phreaks.  Real phone phreaks are "telecommunications hobbyists" who
experiment, play with and learn from the phone system.  Occasionally this
experimenting, and a need to communicate with other phreaks (without going
broke), leads to free calls.  The free calls are but a small subset of a TRUE
phone phreaks activities."

Have Phun,
