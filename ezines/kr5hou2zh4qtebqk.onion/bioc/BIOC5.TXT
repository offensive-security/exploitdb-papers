PREFACE:

Previous installments of this series
were focused on telephony from a
Network point-of-view.  Part V will
deal with telephone electronics
focusing primarily on the subscriber's
telephone.  Hereinafter simply referred to as "fone."

Wiring:
-------

Assuming a standard one-line fone,
there are usually 4 wires that lead
out of the fone set.  These are
standardly colored red, green, yellow,
& black.  The red & green wires are the
two that are actually hooked up to your
CO.  The yellow wire is sometimes used
to ring different fones on a party line
(ie, one #, several families--found
primarily in rural areas where they pay
less for the service and they don't use
the fone as much); otherwise, the
yellow is usually just ignored. On some
two-line fones, the red & green wires
are used for the first fone # and the
yellow & black are used for the second
line.  In this case there must be an
internal or external device that
switches between the two lines and
provides a hold function. (Such as
Radio Shack's outrageously priced 2
line & hold module).

In telephony, the green & red wires are
often referred to as tip (T) & ring
(R), respectively.  The tip is the more
positive of the two wires.  This naming
goes back to the old operator cord
boards where one of the wires was the
tip of the plug and the other was the
ring (of the barrel).

A rotary fone (aka dial or pulse) will
work fine regardless of whether the red
(or green) wire is connected the tip(+)
or ring(-).  A touch-tone (TM) fone is
a different story, though.  It will not
work except if the tip(+) is the green
wire. [Although, some of the more
expensive DTMF fones do have a bridge
rectifier which compensates for
polarity reversal.]  This is why under
certain (non-digital) switching
equipment you can reverse the red &
green wires on a touch-tone fone and
receive free DTMF service.  Even though
it won't break dial tone, reversing the
wires on a rotary line on a digital
switch will cause the tones to be
generarted.

Voltages, Etc.
--------------

When your telephone is on-hook (ie,
hung up) there is approximately 48
volts of DC potential across the tip &
ring.  When the handset of a fone is
lifted a few switches close which cause
a loop to be connected (known as the
"local loop") between your fone & the
CO.  Once this happens DC current is
able to flow through the fone with less
resistance. This causes a relay to
energize which causes other CO
equipment to realize that you want
service.  Eventually, you should end up
with a dial tone.  This also causes the
48 VDC to drop down into the vicinity
of 12 volts.  The resistance of the
loop also drops below the 2500 ohm
level, though FCC licensed telephone
equipment must have an off-hook
impedance of 600 ohms.

As of now, you ahands of our "friends"
at D&B. To say the least, they weren't exactly
thrilled about it. In fact, they did not even
believe that they had a security problem!
(Well, that just goes to prove that if you are
good, no one knows that you are there!)

     In a big effort to defeat us, they called
in an outside service to spruce up their
"security."  Well, fortunately for us, we were
able to find out about the new system!  (Which
wasn't really a problem. First, they had the new
dial-ups when you logged on, and as always they
have a nice little place on Telenet! (Where we do
most of our work: C 20188).

     Now, they have set up a new system they
like to call DunsNet. They are trying to pass
it off as a ectionately call this mute a black box.

The following are instructions on how
to build a simple black box.  Of
course, anything that prevents the
voltage from dropping would work.

You only need two parts:  A SPST toggle
switch and a 10,000 ohm (10 K), 1/2
watt resistor.  Any electronics store
should stock these parts.

Now, cut 2 pieces of wire (about 6
inches long) and attach one end of each
wire to one of the terminals on the
switch.  Now turn your K500 (standard
desk fone) upside down and take off the
cover.  Locate wire (disconnect it from its
terminal).  Now bring the switch out
the rear of the fone and replace the cover.

Put the switch in a position where you
receive a dial tone.  Mark this
position NORMAL.  Mark the other side FREE.

When your phriends call (at a
prearranged time), quickly lift & drop
the receiver as fast a possible.  This
will stop the ringing (do it again if
it doesn't) with out starting the
billing.  It is important that you do
it quickly (less than 1 second). Then
put the switch in the FREE position and
pick up the fone.  Keep all calls short
and preferrably under 15 minutes.

NOTE:  If someone picks up an extension
       in the called parties house and
       that fone is not set for FREE
       then billing will start.

NOTE:  An old way of signalling a
       phriend that you are about to
       call is making a collect call to
       a non-existant person in the
       house.  Since your friend will
       not accept the charges, he will
       know that you are about to call
       and thus prepare the black box
       (or visa versa).

WARNING:  The Telco can detect black
          boxes if they suspect one on
          your line.  This is done due
          to the presence of AC voice
          signal at the wrong DC level!

NOTE:  The Black Box will not work
       under ESS or other similar
       digital switches since ESS does
       not connect the voice circuits
       until the fone is picked up
       (& billing starts).  Instead,
       ESS uses an "artificial"
       computer generated ring.

Ringing:
--------

To inform a subscriber of an incoming
call, the Telco sends 90 volts (PK) of
pulsing DC down the line (at around 15
to 60 Hz; usually 20 Hz).  In most
fones this causes a metal armature to
be attracted alternately between two
electro-magnets thus striking 2 bells.
Of course, the standard bell (patented
in 1878 by Tom A. Watson) can be
replaced by a more modern electronic
bell or signaling device.

Also, you can have lights and other
similar devices in lieu of (or in
conjunction with) the bell.  A simple
neon light (with its corresponding
resistor) can simply be connected
between the red & green wires (usually
L1 & L2 on the network box) so that it
lights up on incoming calls.

WARNING:  90 VDC can give quite
          a shock.  Exercise extreme
          caution if you wish to
          further persue these topics.

Also included in the ringing circuit is
a capacitor tbig savings of time since the hassle
of using a time shared public network does not
exist. We're sure that Mr. J.W.P. of DUNSPRINT had
more on his mind when he wrote the letter (on the
system)! DunsNet is accessible from a regular
dial-up.  We have not been able to get a number
yet for this system, but once on it allegedly
works just like Telenet! Two carriage returns and
you will see "DunsNet" then the familiar "@"
symbol. To use the system like we showed you, type
"RPTS" at thiup to drop a trouble
card for long periods of ringing then a
"no-no" detection device may be placed on the line.

Incidentally, the term "ring trip"
refers to the CO process involved to
stop the AC ringing signal when the
calling fone goes off hook.

NOTE:  It is suggested that you
       actually dissect fones to help
       you better understand them.
       It will also help you to better
       understand the concepts here if
       you actually prove them to
       yourself.  For example, actually
       take the voltage readings on
       your fone line [any simple
       multi-tester (a must) will do.]
       Phreaking is an interactive
       process not a passive one!

Dialing:
--------

On a standard fone, there are two
common types of dialing:  pulse &
DTMF.  Of course, some people insist
upon being different and don't use the
DT thus leaving them with MF (Multi
Frequncy, aka operator, blue box)
tones.  This is another "no-no" and the
Telco Security gentelmen have a special
knack for dealing with such "phreaks" on the network.

When you dial rotary, you are actually
rapidly breaking & reconnecting
(breaking & making) the local loop once
for each digit dialed. Since the physical
connection must be broken, you cannot
dial if another extension (of that #)
is off-hook.  Neither of the fones will
be able to dial pulse unless the other hangs up.

Another term often referred to in
telephone electronics is the break
ratio.  In the US, the standard is 10
pulses per second.  When the circuit is
opened it is called the break interval.
When it is closed it is called the make
interval.  In the US, there is a 60
millisecond (ms) make period and a 40
ms break period.  (60+40=100 ms = 1/10
second).  This is referred to as a 60%
make interval.  Some of the more
sophisticated electronic fones can
switch between a 60% & a 67% make
interval.  This is due to the fact that
many foreign nations use a 67% break interval.

Have you ever been in an office or a
similar facility and saw a fone waiting
to be used for a free call but some
asshole put a lock on it to prevent outgoing calls?

Well, don't fret phellow phreaks, you
can simulate pulse dialing by rapidly
depressing the switchook.  (If you
depress it for longer than a second it
will be construed as a disconnect.)  By
rapidly switchooking you are causing
the local loop to be broken & made
similar to rotary dialing!  Thus if you
can manage to switchook rapidly 10
times you can reach an operator to
place any call you want!  This takes
alot of practice, though.  You might
want to practice on your own fone
dialing a friend's # or something else.
Incidentally, this method will also
work with DTMF fones since all DTMF
lines can also handle rotary.

Another problem with pulse dialing is
that it produces high-voltage spikes
that make loud clicks in the earpiece
and cause the bell to "tinkle."  If you
never noticed this then your fone has a
special "anti-tinkle" & earpiece
shorting circuit (most do).  If you
have ever dissected a rotary fone (a
must for any serious phreak) you would
have noticed that there are 2 sets of
contact that open and close during
pulsing (on the back of the rotary dial
under the plastic cover).  One of these
actually opens and closes the loop
while the other mutes the earpiece by
shorting it out.  The second contacts
also activates a special anti-tinkle
circuit that puts a 340 ohm resistor
across the ringing circuit which
prevents the high voltage spikes from
interferring with the bell.

Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) is a
modern day improvement on pulse dialing
in several ways.  First of all, it is
more convenient for the user since it
is faster and can be used for signaling
after the call is completed (ie, SCC's,
computers, etc.).  Also, it is more
up to par with modern day switching
equipment (such as ESS) since pulse
dialing was designed to actually move
relays by the number of digits dialed
(in SxS offices).

Each key on a DTMF keypad produces 2
frequencies simultaneously (one from
the high group and another from the low group).

           1209  1336  1477  1633
             (High Group--in Hz)

A portable DTMF keypad is known as a white box.

The fourth column (1633 Hz) is not
normally found on regular fones but it
does have several special uses.  For
one, it is used to designate the
priority of calls on AUTOVON, the
military fone network.  These key are
called:  Flash, Immediate, Priority, &
Routine (with variations) instead of
ABCD.  Secondly, these keys are used
for testing purposes by the Telco.  In
some area you can find loops as well as
other neat tests (see Part II) on the
555-1212 directory assistance exchange.
For this, you would call up an DA in
certain areas [that have an Automatic
Call Distributor (ACD)] and hold down
the "D" key which should blow the
operator off.  You will then hear a
pulsing dial tone which indicates that
you are in the ACD internal testing
mode.  You can get on one side of a
loop by dialing a 6.  The other side is
7.  Some phreaks claim that if the
person on side 6 hangs up, occasionally
the equipment will screw up and start
directing directory assistance calls to
the other side of the loop.  Another
alleged test is called REMOB which
allows you to tap into lines by
entering a special code followed by the
7 digit number you want to monitor.
Then there is the possibility of mass conferencing.

ACD's are become rare though.  You will
probably have to make several NPA-555-
1212 calls before you find one.

You can modify regular fones quite
readily so that they have a switch to
change between the 3rd and 4th columns.
This is called a silver box (aka grey
box) and plans can be found in Tap as
well as on many BBS's.

Transmitter/Receiver:
---------------------

When you talk into the transmitter, the
sound waves from your voice cause a
diaphragm to vibrate and press against
the carbon granules (or another similar
substance).  This causes the carbon
granules to compress and contract thus
changing the resistance of the DC
coupled path through it.  Therefore,
your AC voice signal is superimposed
over the DC current of the local loop.
The receiver works in a similar fashion
where the simple types utilize a
magnet, armature, & diaphragm.

Hybrid/Induction Coil:
----------------------

As you may have noticed, there are two
wires for the receiver and two for the
transmitter in the fone, yet the local
loop consists of 2 wires instead of 4.
This 4-wire to 2-wire conversion is
done inside the fone by a device known
as an induction coil which uses
coupling transformers.  All of the
internal Telco trunks also use 4 wires.
It is only the local loop that uses 2
since it is cheaper.  A device in the
CO known as a hybrid converts between 4
and 2 wire set-ups similar to the
induction coil inside the fone.
Special data transmission lines require
extremely low signal to noise ratios,
they require the full four wires--two
for transmission and two for receiving
(even on the local loop).

Miscellaneous:
--------------

In the telephone, there is also a
balancing network consisting of a few
capacitors & resistors which provide
sidetone.  Sidetone allows the caller
to hear his own volume in the receiver.
He can then adjust his voice
accordingly.  This prevents people from
shouting or speaking too softly without noticing it.

Hold:

When a telephone goes off hook, the
resistance drops below 2500 ohms.  At
this point, the Telco will send a dial
tone.  To put someone on hold you must
put a 1000 ohm resistor (1 watt) across
the Tip & Ring before it reaches the
switchook.  In this way, when the fone
is hung up (for hold) the resistance
remains below 2500 ohms which causes
the CO to believe that you are still
off-hook.  You can build a simple hold
device using the following pictoral diagram:
                                     /

   (GREEN) O------------------------/
    [L2]
                      --> To Rest of Fone

This hold device is only effective if
you also hang up the fone.  To make
a hold/mute switch, simple connect
a wire in place of the 1K resistor
to effect a short circuit (who cares
if you damage CO equipment?).

Conclusion:
-----------

NOTE:  Many of the electronics
       components of normal fones
       (K500) are enclosed in the
       network box (which shouldn't
       be opened).

I have assumed that the reader has a
basic knowledge of electronics.  Also,
I have assumed that you have read the 4
previous installments of this series
(and hopefully enjoyed them).

In part VI, we will take a look at
fortress fones.
