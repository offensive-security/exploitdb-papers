PREFACE:

IN PART III, WE WILL DISCUSS THE DIALING PROCEDURES FOR DOMESTIC AS WELL
AS INTERNATIONAL DIALING.  WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE TELEPHONE
NUMBERING PLAN.

===============================
=NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING PLAN=
===============================

IN NORTH AMERICA, THE TELEPHONE NUMBERING PLAN IS AS FOLLOWS:

     A) A 3 DIGIT NUMBERING PLAN AREA
        (NPA) CODE, [IE, AREA CODE]

     B) A 7 DIGIT TELEPHONE #
        CONSISTING OF A 3 DIGIT CENTRAL
        OFFICE (CO) CODE PLUS A 4 DIGIT
        STATION #.

THESE 10 DIGITS ARE CALLED THE NETWORK ADDRESS OR DESTINATION CODE.  IT
IS IN THE FORMAT OF:

        AREA CODE   TELEPHONE #
        ---------   -----------

           N*X        NXX-XXXX

   WHERE:  N = A DIGIT FROM 2-9
           * = THE DIGIT 0 OR 1
           X = A DIGIT 0-9

AREA CODES:
-----------

CHECK YOUR TELEPHONE BOOK OR THE SEPARATE LISTING OF AREA CODES FOUND ON
MANY BBS'S.  HERE ARE THE SPECIAL AREA CODES (SAC'S):

     510 - TWX (USA)
     610 - TWX (CANADA)
     700 - NEW SERVICE
     710 - TWX (USA)
     800 - WATS
     810 - TWX (USA)
     900 - DIAL-IT SERVICES
     910 - TWX (USA)

THE OTHER AREA CODES NEVER CROSS STATE LINES, THEREFORE EACH STATE MUST
HAVE ATLEAST ONE EXCLUSIVE NPA CODE.  WHEN A COMMUNITY IS SPLIT BY A
STATE LINE, THE CO #'S ARE OFTEN INTERCHANGABLE (IE, YOU CAN DIAL THE
SAME # FROM 2 DIFFERENT AREA CODES)


TWX:

TWX (TELEX II) CONSISTS OF 5 TELETYPE- WRITER AREA CODES.  THEY ARE
OWNED BY WESTERN UNION.  THESE SAC'S MAY ONLY BE REACHED VIA OTHER TWX
MACHINES.  THESE RUN AT 110 BAUD.  BESIDES THE TWX #'S, THESE MACHINES
ARE ROUTED TO NORMAL TELEPHONE #'S.  TWX MACHINES ALWAYS RESPOND WITH AN
ANSWERBACK.  FOR EXAMPLE, WU'S FYI TWX # IS (910) 988- 5956, THE
CORRESPONDING REAL NUMBER TO THIS IS (201) 279-5956.  THE ANSWERBACK FOR
THIS SERVICE IS "WU FYI MAWA."

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY A TWX MACHINE, YOU CAN STILL SEND TWX MESSAGES
USING EASYLINK [800/325-4112 - SEE TUC'S AND MY ARTICLE ENTITLED
"HACKING WESTERN UNION'S EASYLINK]

700:

AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, THE 700 EXCHANGE DOES NOT YET EXIST.  AT&T
PLANS TO USE IT SOON THOUGH.  THEY PLAN TO MAKE IT A TYPE OF FANCY CALL
FORWARDING SERVICE.  IT WILL BE TARGETED TOWARDS SALESMEN ON THE RUN.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS, I'LL EXPLAIN IT WITH AN EXAMPLE.  LET'S SAY
JOE Q. SALESPIG WORKS FOR AT&T SECURITY AND HE IS ON THE RUN CHASING A
PHREAK AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ROYALLY SCREWED UP AN IMPORTANT COSMOS
SYSTEM.  LET'S SAY THAT JOE'S 700 # IS (700) 382-5968.  EVERYTIME JOE
GOES TO A NEW HOTEL, HE DIALS A SPECIAL 700 #, ENTERS A CODE, AND THE #
WHERE HE IS STAYING.  NOW, IF HIS BOSS RECEIVED SOME IMPORTANT INFO, ALL
HE WOULD DO IS DIAL (700) 382-5968 AND IT WOULD RING WHEREVER JOE LAST
PROGRAMMED IT TO. NEAT, HUH?

800:

THIS SAC IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES SINCE IT ALLOWS FOR TOLL-FREE CALLS.

INWARD WATS (INWATS): INWARD WIDE AREA TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IS THE
800 #'S THAT WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. 800 #'S ARE SET UP IN SERVICE
AREAS OR BANDS.  THERE ARE 6 OF THESE.  BAND 6 IS THE LARGEST AND YOU
CAN CALL A BAND 6 # FROM ANYWHERE IN THE US EXCEPT THE STATE WHERE THE
CALL IS TERMINATED (THIS IS WHY MOST COMPANIES HAVE ONE 800 # FOR THE
COUNTRY AND THEN ANOTHER FOR JUST ONE STATE).  BAND 5 INCLUDES THE 48
CONTIGUOUS STATES.  ALL THE WAY DOWN TO BAND 1 WHICH INCLUDES ONLY THE
STATES CONTIGUOUS TO THAT ONE. THEREFORE, LESS PEOPLE CAN REACH A BAND 1
INWATS # THAT A BAND 6 #.

INTRASTATE INWATS #'S (IE, YOU CAN CALL IT FROM ONLY 1 STATE) ALWAYS
HAVE A 2 AS THE LAST DIGIT IN THE EXCHANGE (IE, 800-NX2-XXXX).  THE NXX
ON 800 #'S REPRESENT THE AREA WHERE THE BUSINESS IS LOCATED.  FOR
EXAMPLE, A # BEGINNING WITH 800-431 WOULD TERMINATE AT A NY CO

800 #'S ALWAYS END UP IN A HUNT SERIES IN A CO. THIS MEANS THAT IT TRIES
THE FIRST # ALLOCATED TO THE COMPANY FOR THEIR 800 LINES; IF THIS IS
BUSY IT WILL THEN TRY THE NEXT #, ETC).  YOU MUST HAVE A MINIMUM OF TWO
LINES PER EACH 800 #.  FOR EXAMPLE, TRAVELNET USES A HUNT SERIES.  IF
YOU DIAL (800) 521-8400, IT WILL FIRST TRY THE # ASSOCIATED WITH 8400;
IF IT IS BUSY IT WILL GO TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE PORT, ETC. INWATS
CUSTOMERS ARE BILLED BY THE # OF HOURS OF CALLS THAT ARE MADE TO THEIR
#.

OUTWATS (OUTWARD WATS): OUTWATS ARE FOR MAKING OUTGOING CALLS ONLY.
LARGE COMPANIES USE OUTWATS SINCE THEY RECEIVE BULK-RATE DISCOUNTS.
SINCE OUTWATS # CANNOT HAVE INCOMING CALLS, THEY ARE IN THE FORMAT OF:

(800) *XX-XXXX

WHERE * IS THE DIGIT 0 OR 1 WHICH CANNOT BE DIALED UNLESS YOU BOX THE
CALL.  THE *XX IDENTIFIES THE TYPE OF SERVICE AND THE AREAS THAT THE
COMPANY CAN CALL.

REMEMBER:
       INWATS + OUTWATS = WATS EXTENDER
       (SEE PART I)

900:

THIS DIAL-IT SAC IS A NATIONWIDE DIAL-IT SERVICE.  IT IS USED FOR TAKING
TELEVISION POLLS AND OTHER STUFF.  THE FIRST MINUTE CURRENTLY COSTS AN

TAKES IN ALOT OF REVENUE IN THIS WAY.

N11 CODES:

AREAS.

     011 - INTERNATIONAL DIALING PREFIX
     211 - COIN REFUND OPERATOR

=======================
=INTERNATIONAL DIALING=
=======================

WITH INTERNATIONAL DIALING, THE WORLD HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO 9 NUMBERING
ZONES.

TO MAKE AN INTERNATION CALL, YOU MUST DIAL: INT. PREFIX + COUNTRY CODE +
NAT. #

IN NORTH AMERICA, THE INTERNATIONAL DIALING PREFIX IS 011 FOR
STATION-TO- STATION CALLS AND 01 FOR OPERATOR- SERVICED CALLS.  IDDD
STANDS FOR INTERNATIONAL DIRECT DISTANCE DIALING.

THE COUNTRY CODE, WHICH VARIES FROM 1 TO 3 DIGITS, ALWAYS HAS THE WORLD
NUMBERING ZONE AS THE FIRST DIGIT.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE COUNTRY CODE FOR
THE UNITED KINGDOM IS 44, THUS IT IS IN WORLD NUMBERING ZONE 4.

SOME BOARDS(Like OSUNY) MAY CONTAIN A COMPLETE LISTING OF OTHER COUNTRY
CODES, BUT HERE ARE A FEW:

     1 - NORTH AMERICA (US, CANADA,ETC)
    20 - EGYPT
   258 - MOZAMBIQUE
    34 - SPAIN
    49 - GERMANY
    52 - MEXICO (SOUTHERN PORTION)
    61 - AUSTRALIA
     7 - USSR
    81 - JAPAN
    98 - IRAN

IF YOU CALL FROM AN AREA OTHER THAN NORTH AMERICA, THE FORMAT IS
GENERALLY THE SAME.  FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO CALL THE WHITE
HOUSE FROM SWITZERLAND.  FIRST YOU WOULD DIAL 00 (THE SWISS
INTERNATIONAL DIALING PREFIX), THEN 1 (THE US COUNTRY CODE), FOLLOWED BY
202-456-1414 (THE NATIONAL # FOR THE WHITE HOUSE).

ALSO, COUNTRY CODE 87 IS RESERVED FOR MARITIME MOBILE SERVICE, IE
CALLING SHIPS:

     871 - MARISAT (ATLANTIC)
     872 - MARISAT (PACIFIC)
     873 - MARISAT (INDIAN )

INTERNATIONAL SWITCHING:

IN NORTH AMERICA, THERE ARE CURRENTLY 7 NO. 4 ESS'S THAT PERFORM THE
DUTY OF ISC (INTERNATION SWITCHING CENTERS).  ALL INTERNATIONAL CALLS
DIALED FROM NUMBERING ZONE 1 WILL BE ROUTED THROUGH ONE OF THESE
"GATEWAY CITIES."  THEY ARE:

     182 -  WHITE PLAINS, NY
     183 -  NEW YORK, NY
     184 -  PITTSBURGH, PA
     185 -  ORLANDO, FL
     186 -  OAKLAND, CA
     187 -  DENVER, CO
     188 -  NEW YORK, NY

THE 18X SERIES ARE OPERATOR ROUTING CODES FOR OVERSEAS ACCESS (TO BE
FURTHER DISCUSSED WITH BLUE BOXES).  ALL INTERNATIONAL CALLS USE A
SIGNALING SYSTEM CALLED CCITT.  IT IS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR
SIGNALING.


COMING SOON:
------------

IN PART IV, WE WILL DISCUSS SWITCHING EQUIPMENT, VARIOUS OPERATORS, CO
TYPES, ETC.
