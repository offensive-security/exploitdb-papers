                              Revised:  15-JUN-84
 
 PREFACE:
 --------
 
 Part IV will deal  with the various types  of operators, office hierarchy,  &
   switching equipment.
 
 OPERATORS:
 ----------
 
 There are many  types of operators  in The Network  and the more  common ones
   will be discussed.
 
 TSPS Operator:
 
 The TSPS [(Traffic Service Position  System) as opposed to This  Shitty Phone
   Service]  Operator  is  probably  the  bitch  (or  bastard  for the phemale
   liberationists) that most of us are use to having to deal with.
 
 Here are her responsibilities:
 
 1) Obtaining billing information for Calling Card or 3rd number calls.
 
 2) Identifying called customer on person-to-person calls.
 
 3) Obtaining acceptance of charges on collect calls.
 
 4) Identifying calling numbers. This only  happens when the calling # is  not
    automatically recorded by CAMA (Centralized Automatic Message  Accounting)
    &  forwarded  from  the  local  office.  This could be caused by equipment
    failures (ANIF - Automatic Number Identification Failure) or if the office
    is not equipped for CAMA (ONI - Operator Number Identification).
 
 <I once had an equipment failure happen to me & the TSPS operator came on and
   said, "What # are you calling FROM?" Out of curiosity, I gave her the #  to
   my CO, she thanked me & then I was connected to a conversion that  appeared
   to be between a  frameman & his wife.  Then it started ringing  the party I
   originally  wanted  to  call  &  everyone  phreaked out (excuse the pun). I
   immediately dropped this dual line conference!>
 
 You shouldn't  mess with  the TSPS  operator since  she KNOWS  where you  are
   calling from.  Your number  will show  up on  a 10-digit  LED read-out (ANI
   board) She also knows whether or not  you are at a fortress fone &  she can
   trace calls quite readily. Out of all the operators, she is one of the MOST
   DANGEROUS.
 
 INWARD Operator:
 
 This operator assists your local TSPS ("O") operator in connecting calls. She
   will never question a call as long as the call is within HER SERVICE  AREA.
   She can only be reached  via other operators or by  a Blue Box. From a  BB,
   you would  dial KP+NPA+21+ST  for the  INWARD operator  that will help you
   connect any calls within that NPA only. (Blue Boxing will be discussed in a
   future part of BASIC TELCOM)
 
 DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE Operator:
 
 This  is  the  operator  that  you  are  connected  to  when you dial: 411 or
   NPA-555-1212. She  does not  readily know  where you  are calling from. She
   does not have access  to unlisted #'s, but  she does know if  an unlisted #
   exists for a certain listing.
 
 There is also a directory assistance for deaf people who use  Teletypewriters
   If your modem can transfer BAUDOT [(45.5 baud)/ (the Apple Cat can)],  then
   you can call  him/her up and  have an interesting  conversation. The #  is:
   800-855-1155. They uses the standard Telex abbreviations such as GA for  Go
   Ahead.  They  tend  to  be  nicer  &  will  talk  longer  than your regular
   operators.  Also,  they  are  more  vulnerable  into  being  talked  out of
   information  through  the  process  of  "social  engineering"  as  Cheshire
   Catalyst would put it.
 
 <Unfortunately, they do not have access to much. I once bullshitted with  one
   of these operators and  I found out that  there are 2 such  DA offices that
   handle TTY. One  is in Philadelphia  and the other  is in California.  They
   have approximately 7 operators each. Most of the TTY operators think  their
   job is boring (based on an  official "BIOC poll"). They also feel  they are
   under-paid. They actually call  up a regular DA  # to process your  request
   (Sorry, no fancy computers!).>
 
 Other operators have access to their own DA by dialing KP+NPA+31+ST (MF).
 
 In the confusion due to the  aftermath of the Bell System break-up,  it seems
   that it will now cost 50 cents per DA call! Exceptions seem to be  Canadian
   DA & the TTY DA (for the time being). Thus you might be able to avoid being
   charged for DA  calls by using  your computer [running  at 45.5 baud!]  and
   their 800 TOLL-FREE #! If they  decide to charge from fortresses also,  the
   method of making  DA calls from  the fortress and  purposely asking for  an
   unlisted # so you  can have the operator  credit you home #  will no longer
   work!
 
 CN/A Operators:
 
 CN/A operators are operators that  do exactly the opposite of  what directory
   assistance operators are for. See part II, for more info on CN/A & #'s.  In
   my experiences, these operators  know more than the  DA op's do &  they are
   more susceptible to "social engineering." It is possible to bullshit a CN/A
   operator for the NON-PUB DA # (ie,  you give them the name & they  give you
   the unlisted  #). This  is due  to the  fact that  they assume  your are  a
   phellow company employee. Unfortunately,  the break-up has resulted  in the
   break-up of a few NON-PUB #'s and policy changes in CN/A.
 
 INTERCEPT Operator:
 
 The intercept operator is  the one that you  are connected to when  there are
   not  enough  recordings  available  to  tell  you  that  the  #  has   been
   disconnected or  changed. She  usually says,  "What #  you callin'?" with a
   foreign accent.  This is  the lowest  operator lifeform.  Even though  they
   don't know where you are calling from, it is a waste of your time to try to
   verbally abuse them since they usually understand very little English.
 
 Incidentally, a few areas do have intelligent intercept operators.
 
 OTHER Operators:
 
 And  then  there  are  the:  Mobile,Ship-to-Shore, Conference, Marine Verify,
   "Leave Word & Call Back," Rout & Rate (KP+800+141+1212+ST - new # as result
   of Bell breakup), & other special operators who have one purpose or another
   in the Network.
 
 Problems with an Operator? Ask to speak to their supervisor...or better  yet,
   the Group Chief (who is the highest ranking official in any office) who  is
   the  equivalent  of  the  Madame  in  a  whorehouse (if you will excuse the
   analogy).
 
 By the way, some CO's that will allow you to dial a 1 or 0 as the 4th  digit,
   will  also  allow  you  to  call  special  operators & other phun Telco #'s
   without a  blue box.  This is  very rare  though! For example, 212-121-1111
   will get you a NY Inward Operator.
 
 ==================
 =OFFICE HIERARCHY=
 ==================
 
 Every switching  office in  North America  (the NPA  system), is  assigned an
   office name & class. There are  five classes of offices numbered 1  through
   5. Your CO is most likely a class 5 or end office. All Long-Distance (Toll)
   calls are switched  by a toll  office which can  be a class  4, 3, 2,  or 1
   office. There  is also  a 4X  office called  an intermediate  point. The 4X
   office is a digital one that can have an unattended exchange attached to it
   (known as a Remote Switching Unit-RSU).
 
 The following chart will list the Office #, name, & how many of those offices
   existed in North America in 1981.
 
                     Class       Name       Abb  # Existing
                    ----- ---------------- --- ------------
                       1   Regional Center  RC         12
                       2   Sectional Center SC         67
                       3   Primary Center   PC        230
                       4   Toll Center      TC      1,300
                       4P  Toll Point       TP
                       4X  Intermediate Pt  IP
                       5   End Office       EO     19,000
                       R   RSU              RSU
 
 When connecting  a call  from one  party to  another,the switching  equipment
   usually tries to find the shortest route between the Class 5 end office  of
   the caller & the Class 5 end office of the called party. If no inter-office
   trunks exist between the 2 parties, it will then move upto the next highest
   office for servicing  (Class 4). If  the Class 4  office cannot handle  the
   call by sending it to another Class 4  or 5 office, it will be sent to  the
   next office in  the hierarchy (3).  The switching equipment  first uses the
   high-usage interoffice trunk groups, if they  are busy it then goes to  the
   final  trunk  groups  on  the  next  highest  level.  If the call cannot be
   connected then, you  will probably get  a re-order [120  IPM (Interruptions
   Per  Minute)  busy  signal]  signal.  At  this  time,  the  guys at Network
   Operations are  probably shitting  in their  pants and  trying to avoid the
   dreaded Network Dreadlock (as seen on TV!).
 
 It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  9  connections in tandem is called
   ring-around-the rosy and it has  never occurred in telephone history.  This
   would cause an endless loop connection. [a neat way to really screw-up  the
   Network]
 
 The 10 regional centers in the US  & the 2 in Canada are all  interconnected.
   They form the foundation of  the entire telephone network. Since  there are
   only 12 of them, they are listed below:

 =====================
 =SWITCHING EQUIPMENT=
 =====================
 
 In the  Network, there  are 3  major types  of switching  equipment. They are
   known as: Step, Crossbar, & ESS.
 
 
 STEP-BY-STEP (SxS)
 
 The  Step-By-Step,  a/k/a  the  Strowger  switch  or  two-motion  switch, was
   invented in 1889  by an undertaker  named Almon Strowger.  He invented this
   mechanical switching equipment because he felt that the biased operator was
   routing all requests for an 'undertaker' to her husband's business.
 
 Bell started using  this system in  1918 & as  of 1978, over  53% of the Bell
   exchanges  used  this  method   of  switching.  This  figure   is  probably
   substantially less now.
 
 Step-by-Step switching is controlled directly by the dial pulses which move a
   series of switches (called the switch train) in order. When you first  pick
   up the  fone under  SxS, a  linefinder acknowledges  the request (sooner or
   later) by sending a dial tone. If you then dialed 1234, the equipment would
   first find an idle selector switch. It would then move vertically 1  pulse,
   it would then move  horizontally to find a  free second selector, it  would
   then move 2 vertical pulses,  step horizontally to find the  next selector,
   etc. Thus the first switch in the train takes no digits, the second  switch
   takes 1 digit,  the third switch  takes 1 digit,  & the last  switch in the
   train (called the connector) takes the last 2 digits & connects your calls.
   A normal (10,000 line) exchange requires 4 digits (0000-9999) to connect  a
   local call & thus  it takes 4 switches  to connect every call  (linefinder,
   1st & 2nd selectors, & the connector) .
 
 While it was the first, SxS sucks for the following reasons:
 
 [1] The switches often become jammed thus the calls often become blocked.
 
 [2] You can't use DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency a/k/a Touch-Tone) directly.
     It is possible  that the Telco  may have installed  a conversion kit  but
     then the calls will go through just as slow as pulse, anyway!
 
 [3] They use a lot of  electricity & mechanical maintenance. (bad from  Telco
     point of view)
 
 [4] Everything is hardwired.
 
 They can still hook up  pen registers & other shit  on the line so it  is not
   exactly a phreak haven.
 
 You can identify SxS offices by:
 
 (1) Lack of DTMF or pulsing digits after dialing DTMF.
 
 (2) If you go near the CO, it will sound like a typewriter testing factory.
 
 (3) Lack of speed calling, call forwarding, & other custom services.
 
 (4) Fortress fones that want your money first (as opposed to dial tone  first
     ones).
 
 The preceding don't necessarily imply that you have SxS but they surely  give
   evidence that it might be. Also, if any of the above characteristics exist,
   it certainly  isn't ESS!  Also, SxS  have pretty  much been eradicated from
   large metropolitan areas such as NYC (212).
 
 CROSSBAR:
 
 There are 3 major types of Crossbar systems called: No. 1 Crossbar (1XB), No.
   4 Crossbar  (4XB), &  No. 5  Crossbar (5XB).  5XB has  been the primary end
   office switch of Bell since the 60's  and thus it is in wide-use. There  is
   also a Crossbar Tandem (XBT) used for toll-switching.
 
 Crossbar uses a  common control switching  method. When there  is an incoming
   call, a stored program determines its route through the switching matrix.
 
 In Crossbar, the basic operation principle is that a horizontal & a  vertical
   line are energized in  a matrix known as  the crosspoint matrix. The  point
   where these 2 lines meet in the matrix is the connection.
 
 +==+ =ESS=
 +==+ 
                        Electronic  Switching System (ESS)
                         The Phreak's Nightmare Come True
                      (or Orwell's Prophecy as 2600 puts it)
 
 ESS is  Bell's move  towards the  Airstrip One  society depicted  in Orwell's
   1984.
 
 With ESS,  EVERY single  digit that  you dial  is recorded--even  if it  is a
   mistake. They know who you call, when you call, how long you talked for,  &
   probably what  you talked  about (in  some cases).  ESS can  (and is)  also
   programmed to print out #'s of  people who make excessive calls to  800 #'s
   or  directory  assistance.  This  is  called  the  "800 Exceptional Calling
   Report."  ESS  could  also  be  programmed  to  print out logs of who calls
   certain #'s--like  a bookie,  a known  communist, a  BBS, etc  The thing to
   remember with  ESS is  that it  is a  series of  programs working together.
   These programs can be  very easily changed to  do whatever they want  it to
   do. This  system makes  the job  of Bell  Security, the  FBI, NSA,  & other
   organizations that like to invade privacy incredibly easy.
 
 With ESS, tracing is done in microseconds (Eine Augenblick) & the results are
   printed at the console of a Bell Gestapo officer. ESS will also pick up any
   "foreign" tones on the line such as 2600 Hz!
 
 Bell predicts that the country will become totally ESS by the 1990's.
 
 You can identify ESS by the following which are usually ESS functions:
 [1] Dialing 911 for help.
 [2] Dial-Tone-First fortresses.
 [3] Custom Calling Services such  as: Call Forwarding, Speed Dialing,  & Call
     Waiting. (Ask your business office if you can get these.)
 [4] ANI (Automatic Number Identification) on LD calls.
 
 
 Phreaking does not  come to a  complete halt under  ESS though--just be  very
   careful, though!!!
 
 Due to the fact that ESS has a computer generated "artificial" ring, you  are
   not  directly  connected  to  the  called  parties  line until he picks up.
   Therefore, Black Boxes & Infinity Transmitters will not work under ESS!
 
 NOTE: Another interesting way to find  out what type of equipment you  are on
       is to raid the trash can of you local CO--this art will discussed in  a
       separate article  soon. Asking  for a  tour of  your CO  for a  "school
       report" can also be helpful.
 
 Coming Soon:
 
 In the part V, we will start to take a look at telephone electronics.
 
 Further Reading:
 
 For more information on the above topics, I suggest the following:
 
 Notes on the Network, AT&T, 1980.
 
 Understanding Telephone Electronics,Texas Instruments, 1983.
 
 And subscriptions to:
 
 TAP, Room 603, 147  W 42 St, New  York,NY 10036. Subscriptions are  $10/year.
   Back issues are $0.75. The current issues is #90 (Jan/Feb 1984)
 
 2600, Box  752, Middle  Island, NY  11953. Subscriptions  are $10/year.  Back
   issues are $1 each. The current issue is #6 (June 1984).
 
 They  are  both  excellent  sources  of  all  sorts of information (primarily
   phreaking/hacking).
 
 NOTE: For  the most  part, I  have assumed  that you  have read my previous 3
       courses in the BASIC TELCOM series.
