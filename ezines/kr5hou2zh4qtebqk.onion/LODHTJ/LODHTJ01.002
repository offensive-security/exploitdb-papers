 This article will explain the newly developed LASS system (AT&T Bell Labs),
 and how it may affect us in the near future. Note that the service as it
 appears for customers is called "CLASS", the C standing for Custom. I
 assume this is just for looks.

 LASS
 ----

    The telephone was destined to become a well used and powerful tool for
 otherwise tedious tasks. Gas meters and other metered services would be
 surveyed through the use of automatic data retrieval employing telephone
 communications. All in all, some have big plans for the uses one could put
 the telephone system up to, and CLASS is one plan that is going to drop
 an innovative bombshell on the telecommunicating world.

    At this moment, a local CCIS network feature is being developed by
 Bell Laboratories. This feature will change the way people use fones, and
 will also change the attitude in which they use them. It will give far
 more control of the telephone to the user than ever before. This feature
 is called CLASS (Custom Local Area Signalling Services).

    Everyone will find something useful in this newly developed telephone
 feature. Pizza parlours will no longer have to worry about fraudulent italian
 food mongers, and little old ladies won't have to worry about prank calls
 by certain dubious characters.

    What are all these fantastic features?  These features will
 include call back of the last caller, regardless of whether you have their
 telephone number or not. Another will be distinct call waiting tones, and
 preselected call forwarding (only those people whom you wish to speak to
 will be forwarded). This is a rudimentary list of CLASS features to come.
 It is a very powerful system, and it all relys on LCCIS (Local Common
 Channel Interoffice Signalling), an intra-LATA version of the ever-popular
 CCIS.

 CCIS Background
 ---------------

    CCIS was originally introduced in 1976 as, basically, the signalling
 system to end all signalling systems. Instead of using the voice grade
 trunks to carry signalling information on, a data network would be used. This
 network is comprised of data links from each TO [involved with CCIS] to
 the appropriate STP (signal transfer point). Signalling information is sent
 through these links at 4800 bps to the STPs (Note that baud rates may increase
 due to the economic availability of faster data communications hardware),
 where stored program control routes the signalling information to the needed
 offices in order to open and complete the call path. SPC checks automatically
 for on-hook/off-hook status before opening the path, and if the status is
 off-hook (in this case the customer does not have the call waiting custom
 calling feature), returns information to the originating CO to apply a busy
 signal to the customer. This is but one of many features toll CCIS provides
 the network with.

    Since this text is not centered on the topic of toll CCIS, technical
 aspects aren't as important (except for the comparison between the local
 and toll networks for observational purposes): yet it is important to
 notice how automated and flexible this type of signalling method is, as well
 as its speed and efficiency. All the software control involved with local
 and toll networks is called, fittingly, the "stored program control network."
 or ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network). LCCIS will be addressed in a
 future article.

 CLASS/LCCIS Features
 --------------------

 LCCIS would look like this:



                                   /--\
                                   CO-2
                                   ESS#

                     |               |              |
                     |          ----------          |
                   /--\--LCCIS--|CCIS/SPC|--LCCIS--/--\
                   CO-1         ----------         CO-3
                   ESS#                            ESS#
                   -1A----interoffice trunk group---1A-
                   \--/                            \--/

 SPC = Stored Program Control (Network control and Signal Transfer Point)
 ITG = Interoffice Trunk Group

    Using a high-speed data link between local offices creates a much more
 flexible and more effecient way for intra-LATA central offices to communi-
 cate. Instead of using per-trunk signalling (using the same trunk used for
 voice transmission to send routing and billing information), such data would
 be sent thru a 2400 bps dedicated data link, which interacts with a local
 signal processing and transfer point. From that point, signalling information
 is distributed to appropriate central offices or tandem switches.

    At the during which this article was being initially researched, CLASS was
    only being developed for the #1A ESS switch due to the flexibility of it's
 memory handling, it's speed and what Bell Labs called 'cost efficiency'. At
 the end of the research involved with this article, CLASS was already
 implemented in data stage on ESS#5.

    LCCIS will work with the local switches using stored program con-
 trol, keeping track of call data. The 1A switches will use what
 is called "scratch pad" memory (also known as call store), in conjuction
 with LCCIS's database, to accomplish all the features that LASS provides.
 This memory will hold such data as "line history", and a "screening list".
 That information will make it possible for autoredial, selective call
 forwarding, nuisance call rejection, and distinctive call waiting tones.

 Selective CF
 ------------

    Selective call forwarding is defined by the subscriber (the sub-
 scriber must have conventional call forwarding to request this service).
 Using call store, or more specifically the screening list, one will
 be able to selectively forward a call to another directory number by
 executing a few simple commands on the friendly home-bound telephone
 (unlike migrating telephones most frequently found in hotel rooms). An
 access code (a list will appear at the end of the file) will be entered,
 and a special tone will be issued from the subscriber's CO. The cus-
 tomer will then dial in the numbers he wants forwarded to the particular
 number. After each number, a tone will sound indicating the acceptance
 of the number. Individual BOC's (Bell Operating Companies) will be
 able to define the amount of numbers which may be screened. Once this is
 done, the cusomter hangs up and the ESS takes over. Now, whenever some
 one calls this particular customer, the customer's switch will compare
 the calling line's directory number with those stored in scratch pad
 memory. If the CLID matches one of the numbers in 1A memory associated with
 the called directory number, the number is forwarded. If not, the phone will
 ring at the original destination. This in particular could make it very
 difficult on system hackers, as you could probably imagine. A company can
 subscribe to this CLASS feature, and enter only the numbers of authorized
 users to be forwarded to a computer. Bureaus inside the various telephone
 companies and other sensitive operations can screen calls to particular
 numbers by using this service.

    This is a security that's hard to beat, but of course there is a way
 (simple law of nature: nothing is fail-safe). There will always be the
 obvious way of finding numbers which are being forwarded to, like auto-
 dialing entire exchanges (one after the other). Unfortunetly, CLASS will
 be providing other services which might make "scanning" seem less
 attractive.

 Distinctive Ringing
 -------------------

    Distinctive ringing is handled in the same fashion as selective call
 forwarding is: the screen list in scratch pad memory. The customer may
 enter numbers which the ESS should give special precedence to, and when-
 ever a call is placed to this particular customer's number, ESS checks
 to see whether the CLID matches a directory number listed in the
 switch's memory. If a match is made, the subscriber's CO gives the off-hook
 line a special call waiting tone, or the on-hook phone a distinctive ring
 (possibly using abnormally timed ringing voltage... some readers may picture
 a British Telecom ring as an example, although many foreign audible rings
 tend to be different).

 Call Rejection
 --------------

    Nuisance call rejection, a feature making it possible to block certain
 idiots from ringing your fone (a feature we can all benefit from at
 one time or another... or all the time), uses the information retrieved
 from LCCIS (CLID).  Let's say customer A calls customer B:

                               ----LCCIS----
                     A ---> CO<             >CO ---> B
                               ----trunk----

    Customer B happens to despise customer A, and keys in a special *##
 code. ESS again takes over and looks at the CLID information, and stores
 the calling line directory number in a special screen list associated with
 with customer B. The next time customer A tries calling customer B, the
 terminating office will reroute the call to a local (the originating CO)
 digitized recording telling customer A that the call he made cannot be
 completed due to customer B's request ("I'm sorry, but the customer you
 have tried to reach wishes you were eaten by a rabid canibal on drugs").

 Dial Back
 ---------

    To create such a feature as "dial back" (for called or calling party),
 the ESS scratch pad memory is used again. The same principles are
 used as are employed in the already established custom calling feature,
 auto-redial. CLID will be used in this way:

                                     (received from CLID)
                   last-called-mem     last-caller-mem
                      ----------          ----------
                      |###-####|          |###-####|
                      ----------          ----------

    Your ESS switch will keep track of who you called last, and who called
 you last, thru the retrieval of calling line information provided by
 LCCIS in conjunction with your switch (Your switch will know what number
 you called last by directly storing the digits you dialed previously. Local
 signalling will provide calling line information via LCCIS call
 information forwarding using the data link mentioned). This way, with your
 access code (*##), you will have total re-dial service.

 Customer Trace
 --------------

    This type of memory handling and signalling method will also allow the
 feature that everyone was afraid would abolish "phreaking". Subscriber
 initiated tracing, using the last caller directory number stored at your CO,
 will be available as far as Bell Laboratories is concerned. There seems to be
 two types of "customer originated trace". One will forward the number to local
 authorities, at  which it will be handled through the police. The other
 feature AT&T/Bell Labs is working on will be a display module that will sit by
 your fone, and will display calling directory numbers. All other CLASS
 features that use the calling line information are used at the descretion of
 the caller. The customer originated trace, however, using the individual or
 bulk calling line identification features ("trace") allow the customer to view
 the calling number. The world is not ending... yet, in any case. Individual
 customers will be able to employ a special "privacy code", which when dialed,
 tells the far-end switch not to forward the calling number to a desk display.
 Whether there will be a way to override this or not is obvious: of course.
 The police, the military and government agencies are all likely to have a
 higher priority level than your privacy. It seems that long distance
 carriers could benefit greatly from CLASS. Why Bell/AT&T should give any type
 of special services to OCCs not given to other non-telephone companies,
 especially after equal access is fully implemented, I don't know (but then
 again, it is EQUAL access). It's always possible. It is also possible that
 there will be no desk display. There are those phone phreaks who feel that
 BOC's will never give the end party the priviledge of retrieving the calling
 party's number directly, if not due to plain old Bell policy on the issue of
 privacy. We'll have to wait and see about that point: the desk display is, in
 fact, operational and is being used in test stage. Whether Bell Labs feels
 that this feature can and will be used in a full scale non-beta stage BOC
 situation is a different story. The economic feasability is questionable.

 End Notes
 ---------

    CLASS, using local CCIS, will not function on inter-LATA calls. The
 local CCIS network is exactly that: local, and does not extend into the
 realm of "toll network". This will eventually be corrected (allowing toll
 CCIS to interact with LCCIS as far as CLID information is concerned). How
 the various long distance networks will exchange information with the local
 BOC network has not been determined [by the writer of this article]. It
 would seem like a monumental task to try to integrate the emerging long
 distance companies into the AT&T/BOC ISDN, be it because of equipment
 inconsistancies or lack of cooperation on the part of the OCC, etc. This
 will be discussed in an upcoming article dealing with toll CCIS.
 Although CLASS has been built around the ESS #1A switch, it has, as has been
 mentioned, been co-developed for use with the ESS #5 switching machine.

    CLASS is going to cause problems, as well as create a new environment
 for telephone users. Of course, those problems are only problems to people
 who will generally be reading this article, but the more you know about CLASS
 the more comfortable you'll feel about the service. It can be used to
 one's advantage, even as a telecommunications hobbyist. Just as a
 corporation will be able to set up a complete history of who is calling their
 system, and eventually keep people off the system using the screen list in
 memory, the same features can be applied to bulletin board systems and the
 like. Imagine being able to keep all the local bozos off your board, or
 being able to screen all but your private local users (making your system
 completely inaccessible through the PSTN network from any telephone but
 that of one of your users). It would seem to be a useful feature, if nothing
 else but an easy feature, to implement.

    It is a little difficult, if not plain awkward, to write an article about
 a topic which is subject to change at the researcher's ignorance. I think
 that CLASS is enough of a momentous issue that at least some text by a
 hobbyist should be released for public knowledge purposes.  Yet my awareness
 of the fact that some of this text may be outdated, or inaccurate, by the
 time CLASS is released as a BOC service, is in itself the explanation of why
 there is a version number at the head of this article. Most likely, when CLASS
 becomes public, the second version will be released with update notes
 (if need be...most probably so). I hope you enjoyed it,
