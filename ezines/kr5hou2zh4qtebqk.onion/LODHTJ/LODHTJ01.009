Cable Facility F2 - Distribution
--------------------------------

        The F2 distribution cable is the cable which originates from the F1
feeder in the SAI and distributes individual cable pairs to each subscriber.
This cable can be one of two types: aerial or buried.  The most common is the
aerial distribution cable, although buried cable is the modern trend.  In the
case of aerial F2, the cable or cables leave the SAI underground, and at the
first telephone pole on the distribution span, the cable is routed up the pole.
It then is suspended on the span, such as down a street, and at each group of
houses there is a terminal on the span. This terminal is the aerial drop split-
ter, and it's purpose is to break off several pairs from the distribution cable
in order to distribute them (in the form of aerial drop wires) to each house or
premise.  The location or address of the premise nearest this aerial drop
splitter is the TErminal Address of the F2 serving a certain pair (each group
of pairs in the F2 will have it's own terminal address, unlike the one address
for the F1 terminal (SAI)).  The F2 cable is always the lowest cable on the
telephone pole, and it is usually a great deal larger than the electric power
distribution cables above it.  Often more than one F2 can be seen on a single
pole span.  In this case, the top F2 will usually be the one which is being
distributed to the subscribers on that street, and the lower (and most often
larger) cables are other F2's coming from an SAI and going to the streets
which they service:  These cables consist of multiple spliced spans, and they
will not have any drop wires coming off them (they are marked every few poles
or so at a splicing point called a "bullet closure" which is fully enclosed
and can be quite large (ie. 6" dia, 20" long) as compared to the normal drop
splitters (ie. or similar 4"w x 5"h x 12"l) -- these closures are clamp press-
urized and are not meant to be opened unless the cable is being replaced or
splicing work is being done.  They are not standard cable/pair access points).
        Buried F2 plant is similar to aerial, except that the cable is not
visible because it is underground.  Instead of going to a pole from the SAI,
the cable continues underground.  The drop wires are also underground, and the
method of breaking them from the distribution cable is similar to that of the
aerial drop splitter, except it is a small pedestal or box located on the
ground near the houses it serves.  This address closest to this pedestal is
the TEA for the F2.

F2 Cable Numbering
------------------

        The F2 distribution cable is usually given a 4 or 5 digit number,
depending on the office.  The first 2 or 3 digits should be the number of
the F1 that the F2 was branched off of, and the last 2 or 3 digits identify
the distribution cable. Example-

      F1   Cable                   F2   Cable
             25                          2531
       This F2 cable came from feeder #25^^

        The cable >pair< numbers may be set in a similar way, with the last 3
or 4 digits identifying the pair, and the first digit (usually a 1) identifying
the pair as a feeder or a distribution pair. Example -

      F1   Cable    Pair            F2   Cable    Pair
             25     1748                  2531     748
                    ^--signifies F1 (feeder) cable pair

        Generally, the F1 cable pairs are numbered higher than the F2 cable
pairs, due to the fact that a feeder cable may contain several distribution
cables' worth of cable pairs.  Note once again that all of this numbering
plan is the STANDARD, and it may be far from real life!  As soon as one dist-
ribution pair is replaced, crossed over to another feeder pair, or taken from
service, the set order is interrupted.  In real life, it is most always nece-
ssary to get both F1 and F2 cable assignment data.


                         ********************

--------------------------------------------
Facilities F3-F5, Rural Area Interface (RAI)
--------------------------------------------

        Although cable facilities F3, F4, and F5 may be specified in any loop
plant, they are rarely seen anywhere except in rural areas under the RAND
plan (Rural Area Network Design).  Basically, plants using these extra
facilities are similar to F1/F2 plants, except there are extra cable spans
and/or terminals in the path.  When locating cables, the highest numbered
facility will be at the end of the path, terminating near the subscriber's end
(like a "normal" F2), and the lowest numbered facility will be the feeder from
the CO (like a "normal" F1).  The extra spans will be somewhere in between,
like an intermediate feeder or extra distribution cable with separate cable
access terminals.  One such facility is the Rural Area Interface (RAI), which
can be used in a "feeder-in, feeder-out" arrangement.  This is usually seen on
cable routes of 50 pairs or greater, with a length of longer than 30 kft
(about 6 miles).  In this case, there will be two terminal cabinets in the
feeder path, labelled RAI-A and RAI-B.  The RAI-A is special because it has a
two-part terminal block:  the top has switching panels with 108-type connectors
which cross-connect feeder-in and feeder-out pairs using jumper plugs, and the
bottom has standard 76-type binding posts which cross-connect feeders to
distribution cables for subscribers in the local area of the RAI-A.  The jumper
plugs can only be connected in one way to the switching panels, so random
cross-connection of feeder-in/feeder-out pairs is prevented. In this way, the
cable and pair numbers stay the same as if the feeder cable was uninterrupted.
This is used a lot in rural areas; it allows part of a feeder group to be split
off at the RAI-A like a distribution cable near a town along the route, and
the rest of the feeder group continues on to a town further away, to the RAI-B
where it is terminated as in a "normal" SAI.  In order to access a pair, just
use the last RAI in the span (whichever it is) and treat it just like an SAI.
If the pair terminates at RAI-B, you can also access it at RAI-A! (if you
can locate the pair using color code, BP number, or (ughh) ANI, there should
be test terminals on top of the jumper plugs connecting the 108's on the
switching panel where you can hook your test set -- you can't hook onto a raw
108 connector very easily).  Anyway, the RAI terminal is usually a ground
pedestal with a cabinet such as a 40-type, but it can be aerial mounted on a
pole (hard to access).

Pair-Gain, Carried Derived Feeder
---------------------------------

        Another common facility in rural areas (and in cities or suburbs, es-
pecially near large housing complexes, etc.) is the pair-gain system.  It is
basically a system which consists of a digital link which is distributed,
almost like a normal cable pair, out to a terminal cabinet called a Remote
Terminal (RT) which contains equipment which demultiplexes the digital line
into many "normal" metallic analog telephone lines which go to each subscriber
in the area.  Because the digital line can transmit the audio from several
separate lines and multiplex them onto one cable, only one special cable
pair is needed to come from the CO as a feeder, instead of several separate
ones; this is why it is called a "pair gain" system.  The remote terminal (RT)
contains both the demultiplexing electronics as well as a small "SAI" type
terminal block for connecting the pairs to distribution cables on the side
of the path toward the subscriber.  Because the "feeder" is not a multipair
cable but a digital link (ie. T-carrier), this arrangement is known as a
"carrier-derived feeder."  The SAI part of the RT is used just like a normal
SAI on the distribution side (BLUE), but the feeder side will be slightly
different.  Carrier-derived feeders are always marked with YELLOW labels, and
their pairs will be crossed over to distribution cables just like in an SAI.
So, in order to access a pair in a system like this, you must do so on the
DISTRIBUTION side, because you can't hook an analog test set to a 1.544 Mbps
digital T-carrier line! (or worse yet, a fiber optic cable).  This may be
difficult, because these cabinets are always locked (with few exceptions), so
you'll have to find a terminal closer to the subscriber -- also be aware that
many RT's are equipped with silent intrusion alarms.  Anyway, some common
pair-gain systems are the Western Electric SLC-8, 40, 96, and GTE's MXU,
ranging in size from 8 to over 96 lines.  RT cabinets can often be identified
by the ventillation grilles (with or without a fan inside) which are not
present on SAI's or other non-RT cabinets.

-----------------------------------
Aerial Distribution Splice Closure,
       Drop Wire Splitter
-----------------------------------

        This terminal is the point where the individual cable pair for a
certain subscriber is split from the F2 distribution cable and spliced onto
an aerial drop or "messenger" wire which goes to the subscriber's premises.
In an aerial distribution plant, 2 types of this terminal are common:

1> Western Electric 49-type Ready Access Closure / Cable Terminal

2> Western Electric 53A4, N-type Pole Mount Cable Terminals

     ----------

Type 1>  The 49-type, 1A1, 1B1, and 1C1 closures are all functionally similar.
         This terminal is a semi-rectangular closure, about 15"L x 3"W x 5"H,
         usually black, which is connected directly to the aerial cable itself;
         it is coaxial with the cable, so the cable passes straight through it.
         It splits up to 12 pairs from the distribution cable to a small bin-
         ding post terminal block inside the closure.  Aerial drop wires are
         then connected to these binding posts, and the wires exit the term-
         inal through holes on the bottom.  These wires are strung via strain
         relief clamps on the pole down to the subscriber's site.  The terminal
         closure is opened by pulling out and lifting either the whole cover
         or the front panel after removing the cover fasteners on the bottom
         and/or the sides (the closure is a thick neoprene cover over an alum-
         inum frame).  Inside the case, there is a terminal block and there
         may be some sort of loading coil as well.  The cable and this coil are
         not openable, but the terminal block is.  Since the F2 pair terminates
         in this closure, the F2 BP number (cable/assignment data) corresponds
         to a binding post on this terminal block.  As mentioned earlier, this
         terminal will also contain spare pairs, in case a subscriber wants
         another line.  In order to use one of these pairs, you must either get
         an F2 (and then F1) CP number from LAC using the BP, or you can put a
         trace tone on the pair at the aerial closure and then locate the pair
         at the SAI.  Then a cross-connect would have to be made to an active
         F1 pair, and a drop wire (ughh) would have to be added back at the
         aerial closure.  Anyway, both the binding posts as well as the holes
         (inside + out) are numbered left to right, so you may not even have
         to open the closure if you are just looking for an F2 BP number --
         just trace the drop wire from the house into the numbered hole on the
         closure. The TErminal Address for the F2 is the address of the house
         or premise closest to the pole near this closure.  These terminals
         (esp. 1A1, etc) are also used for straight and branch splices for
         aerial cables, so you may see one cable in / two out;  also, the
         closure can be used for splicing only, so there may not be drop wires
         (in this case, it wont be listed in LMOS because it is not a terminal
         point).  There is generally one of these every pole near a quad of
         houses or so, mounted on the cable about an arm's length from the
         pole.

Type 2>  Both the 53A4 and the N-type terminals serve the same function as
         the 49-type just described, except they are used in situations where
         there are more than 4 houses (8 lines, including provisional pairs).
         This terminal is mounted directly on the pole, about a foot down from
         the aerial cable.  It is not connected in line with the cable, so
         there is no F2 splicing area in the cabinet (rather, a cable stub
         comes from the terminal block and is spliced onto the span close to
         where it touches the pole). It is about 22"H x 9"W x 4"D, rectan-
         gular, and silver (unpainted).  The door is similar to that of a 40-
         type cabinet, but it's much smaller; it is opened using a 7/16" tool
         in the same manner as before, except that the door must be lifted
         before it can be opened or closed.  In this way, the door slides down
         on it's hinges when opened, so it locks in the open position and you
         wont have to worry about it (especially nice because hanging onto a
         pole is enough of a problem).  The terminal block can handle from 25
         to 50 pairs, with 32 holes in the back for aerial drop wires.  Just
         as in the Ready Access Closure, this is the F2 terminal, and the
         numbered binding posts and holes correspond to F2 BP numbers.  The
         TEA will be the address nearest the terminal (just as before).  This
         terminal is common at the first pole on a street, on cul-de-sacs,
         apartments, marinas & harbors, or anywhere there are many drop wires.

Buried Distribution Cross Box and Other Pedestals
-------------------------------------------------

        This terminal serves the same function as the aerial closures, except
it is used in areas with a buried distribution plant.  This cable assignment
for this terminal will be the F2 terminal, and the BP numbers and TEA will
be the same as for the aerial terminals.  Probably the most common cross-boxes
are the PC4,6, and 12; these are around 50" tall by 4, 6, or 12" square respec-
tively, and they are painted gray-green like SAI cabinets.  These are the
smallest pedestals in the distribution plant, and they don't have doors (they
look like waist-high square poles).  In order to open one of these pedestals,
the two bolts on either side half way down the pedestal must be loosened with
a 7/16 hex wrench; then the front cover can be lifted up, out, and off the
rest of the closure.  These terminals are located generally near small groups
of houses (up to about 12 lines usually) on the ground, often near other
utility cabinets (such as electric power transformers, etc).  These are
becoming more common as the new housing tracts use buried distribution plant.
The F2 cable will enter as a cable stub, and it is split into service wires
which go back underground to the subscribers.
        All small pedestals are not necessarily the above type of terminal;
these pedestal closures are often used for other purposes, such as splicing
points in underground distribution, loading coil mounting, and even used as
temporary wire storage containers.  If the terminal contains a terminal
block or it is a significant point on the line, however, it will be listed in
LMOS.  An example of this is a distribution path found by Mark Tabas in a
Mountain Bell area --  there was a small PC12-type closure on the ground near
a street in a remote suburb, and it was serving as a terminal point for a
whole F1 cable.  It was listed as the F1 terminal, and it was at the right
TEA; however, there was no terminal block because it was a splicing point
(just a bunch of pairs connected with Scotchlok plastic connectors which are
hung on a bar in the pedestal closure), so LMOS had no BP number.  Instead,
a color code was listed (see appendix) for the pair in the splice.  Anyway,
the WHOLE F1 went up to an N-type closure on a pole and was split into drop
wires.

--------------------------------------
Multi-Line Building Entrance Terminals
--------------------------------------

        This terminal takes the aerial drop or service wires and cross-connects
them over to the Inside Wire (IW) in the subscriber's building (hotels, busi-
nesses, etc).  There are many different types of terminal blocks for this
terminal, although by far the most common is the Western Electric 66 block.
The 66-type terminal uses a block of metal clips; the wire is pushed onto the
clip with a punch-down tool which also strips the wire.  The block is divided
into horizontal rows which can have from 2 to over 6 clips each.  Since each
row group terminates one pair, two rows are needed for x-connect, one on top of
the other.  The service or drop wire usually enters on the left, and the
inside wire is connected to the far right.  In order to locate a pair, usually
you can visually trace either the service wire or the inside wire to the
block, and often the inside wire side wil be numbered or labelled with an
address, phone number, etc.  It is also possible for this terminal to serve
as an F2 terminal point, if there are a lot of lines.  In this case, LMOS will
list the TEA usually with some physical direction as to where to find it. The
left side will then be numbered as F2 BP's. This terminal is also the demarca-
tion point which separates the customer's equipment from the telco's.  The new
terminals often have an RJ-21 connector on the service wire side, such as a
25-pair for PABX or a Bell 1A2 Key, etc.  There are also "maintenance termina-
ting units" (MTU) which are electronic units connected to the line(s) at the
entrance protector; these are sometimes seen in some telcos.  Basically, they
provide functions such as party ANI on multi-party lines, remote disconnect
(for testing or (click!) non-payment), or half ringers (the most common --
they prevent ringing continuity failures on switches like ESS when there are
no phones hooked to the line when it rings).  MTU terminals are often locked.

Single Pair Station Protector
-----------------------------

        There's really not much to say about this terminal.  Basically, it
takes the service or drop wire and connects it to the inside wire in a single
line residence (houses with 2 lines will have 2 of these).  These are at every
house on an outside wall or basement, and there are two main types: the Western
Electric 123 (with a "150-type" rubber cover), and the old WE 305 and new AT&T
200 Network interface (metal and plastic, respectively). These terminals have
one binding post pair and they will have either gas discharge tubes or carbon
blocks to protect the line from lightning or excess current.  Obviously, there
is no BP number (you just have to visually trace the drop wire to find the
protector). This is also the demarcation point marking the end of the telco's
responsibility, as well as the end of our tour.

                         ********************

Bell System Standard Color Code      Use:
-----------------------------------        Take the #, and find it's closest
Pair #             Tip        Ring   multiple of 5.  Use that number to find
-----------------------------------  the Tip color, and the remainder to find
 01-05           White      Blue    the Ring color (remainder 0 = Slate).
 06-10           Red        Orange  (e.g. Pair #1 = White/Brown, Pair #14 =
 11-15           Black      Green    Black/Brown, Pair #24 = Violet/Brown).
 16-20           Yellow     Brown
 21-25           Violet     Slate

Usually if a color code is needed (such as in a splice case) you can get it
from LAC or the testboard; if it's really essential, it will be in LMOS as
well.  This color code is also used a lot on cable ties (usually with white
stripes and ring colors only), although these are often used randomly.

---------
Test Sets
---------
        This is the "right hand" of both the professional and the amatuer
lineman.  Basically, it is a customized portable telephone which is designed
to be hooked onto raw cable terminals in the field and used to monitor the
line, talk, or dial out.  The monitor function is usually the main difference
between the "butt-in" test set and the normal phone.  If you don't have a
real test set already, the following circuit can convert a normal $4 made-in-
taiwan phone into a working test set.  The "all-in-one" handset units without
bases are the best (I tend to like QUIK's and GTE Flip Phone II's). Anyway-

        When SPST is closed, you are in talk mode; when you lift the switch-
hook on the "test set" phone, you will get a dial tone as if you were a
standard extension of the line you are on.  You will be able to dial out and
receive calls.  When the SPST is opened, the resistor and capacitor are no
longer shunted, and they become part of the telephone circuit.  When you lift
the switchhook on the test set, you will not receive dial tone, due to the fact
that the cap blocks DC, and the resistor passes less than 4 mA nominally (far
below the amount necessary to saturate the supervisory ferrod on ESS or close
the line relay on any other switch).  However, you will be able to silently
monitor all audio on the line.  The cap reactance + the phone's impedance
insure that you won't cut the signal too much on the phone line, which might
cause a noticeable change (..expedite the shock force, SOMEONE'S ON MY LINE!!).
It's also good to have a VOM handy when working outside to rapidly check for
active lines or supervision states.  Also, you can buy test equipment from
these companies:
