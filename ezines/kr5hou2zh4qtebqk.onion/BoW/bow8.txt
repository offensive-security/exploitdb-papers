  WELL HERE'S FUQIN ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. 
IT TOOK SO FUQN LONG TO DO BECAUSE 
EVERYONE IS LIKE ON VACATION, GOT 
BUSTED, OR HAS LIKE FUQIN DISSAPPEARED, 
AND I'VE BEEN DOING REAL LIFE STUFF. 
AND I WENT TO HOPE TOO WHICH WAS LIKE 
PRETTY FUN EXCEPT I SPENT THE WHOLE 
TIME KOURIERING WAREZ FROM MY HOTEL 
ROOM, SO I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO 
ACTUALLY MEET ANYONE EXCEPT THE 
CLEANING LADY WHO WASN'T VERY 
INTERESTING ANYWAY. WE GOT A SHITLOAD 
OF NEW SITES AND SHIT SINCE THE LAST 
ISSUE. AND SINCE WE'RE CYBERPUNKS AND 
SHIT WE NOW GOT A SITE ON THE WORLD 
WIDE WEB (FUQN INFORMATION SUPER 
HIGHWAY). WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING
AN ACCOUNT ON AOL, BUT WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE CLIENT 
SOFTWARE. HERE'S NOW ALL THE SITES
ON THE ISH THAT HAVEN'T BEEN BUSTED
YET (WELL, TWO WERE RM -RF-ED, BUT
THEY'VE BEEN RESTOCKED WITH WAREZ
SINCE)

 WWW -> http://www.io.org/~pluvius/bow.html
 FSP -> 199.2.48.200 31337
 FTP -> etext.archive.umich.edu /Zines/BoW
     -> corrupt.sekurity.com    /pub/ZiNE/BoW
     -> ftp.netcom.com          /pub/illusion/BoW

 SUBMISSIONS HAVE BEEN REALLY SLOW
AND SHIT LATELY, EXCEPT FOR A FEW 
THINGS, THE ONLY STUFF I'VE GOTTEN
IS LIKE LAME SONGS AND STUFF. I'M 
LIKE SICK OF GETTING LYRICS. DON'T
SEND ANYMORE. IT'S LIKE THE ONE 
THING I LIKE BEST, SO IF OTHER PPL
SEND IN SONGS THAT MEANS I DON'T 
GET TO DO ONE.  
 ALSO, DON'T LIKE CALL ME OR MSG
ME ON IRC AND ASK TO BE A DIST SITE,
I WON'T REMEMBER. EMAIL ME YOUR ADD.
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. OTHER WISE I
FORGET AND SHIT. BUT IF YOU EMAIL
ME STUFF I LIKE SAVE IT IN A FILE,
AND IF I GET TO MY ACCOUNT BEFORE
IT GETS WIPED AGAIN, THEN I WILL
LIKE SEE IT AND REMEMBER IT.
SO LIKE JUST EMAIL STUFF TO 
pluvius@io.org AND THEN I'LL LIKE
GET IT AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT.

Maarten Veerman's tip of the week: Keep your system secure by typing these
3 *SIMPLE* commands!
 
  . Login as root (Advanced user's tip: the unix command su will allow you to 
    change to another account without logging out!!!)

  . cd / (Advanced user's tip: cd/ will not work because unix will not find the
    program named "cd/". You will have to put the space there!!!
    I really wish UNIX would follow DOS's example!!!)

  . chmod a-rwx -r (Advanced user's tip: substitute 000 for a-rwx!!!)
 
This is the best way to keep your system secure. It will make absolutely sure
those nasty hackers can't get in! This I guarantee.
 
*** Super Advanced Administrator's tip: These commands work on UNIX 
                                        systems only!

2) "Ex Net-God Gene Spafford is a mild-mannered professor by day.
But, by night, by the light of the full moon, his secret power emerges
as he becomes the infamous "Slimeball"!!  With barely any perceptible
delay, he is able to bring down machines in other countries --
machines over which he has no financial, legal, or administrative
influence or authority -- machines he has never used -- machines
operated by people he doesn't know!  You would think it would require
the people who actually control the machine to pull it off the netz
(sic), but no -- it's the Slimeball!"

3) "Uh, while I'm posting anonymously, I should also point out that
that Spafford person is also responsible for global warming, the
Bosnian conflict, the famine in east Africa, and that Barney the dinosaur
thing.  Oh yeah, and he started every war in Europe over the last 200
years."

"Of course this is all true -- I posted it anonymously only to keep
Spafford from doing something evil and nasty to get even.  That, and
to keep the Brain Moles from Venus from finding where I am hiding out."

4) "It certainly can't be Spaf's lame excuse 'the noise level is too
high' -- after all, the news is full of fascinating posts like this
one:
  * the contents are factual, documented and supported
  * the post is polite
  * the post exhibits tolerance for other points of view than my own
  * the Subject: line accurately describes the post
  * the post is germane to the newsgroup
  * the post is literate and grammatical
If you don't believe me, ask my good friends Canter & Siegel!"

5) "Spafford is in favor of reasonable laws, good security, polite
behavior, and responsible computer use -- so screw 'em.  People know
he isn't in favor of unrestricted anonymous posting, so we'll use that
as an excuse to blame him for something he didn't actually do.  Who
needs proof on the net?  Eventually the rumor will be so widespread,
no one will be able to tell the difference.  What's more, we can
slander him using the very same anonymous services -- what irony!  The
sheep reading the news are so accustomed to believing everything they
see on the net, they won't even notice the anonymous aspect."

You are mine,
Oh precious k0de.
You've been liberated,
Into my sacred abode.
 
Like an untarnished virgin,
You are mine for the beating.
No, never you phear.
On you, I won't be cheating.
 
Belive me when I say,
My desire for you is true.
I'm going to make you a woman.
My sweet bitch's brew.
 
Don't let me find you unfaithful.
You 2-dollar whore.
I'll make you regret it.
I'll slap you till you're sore.
 
You're my hoochie now.
K0de k1dz make no mistake.
Lay a hand on my mistress...
Oh just don't, for your sake.
 
Lamerz take note.
She's found her only man.
You had your chance to grab her.
But into my arms she ran.
 
Now come with me dear,
To our honeymoon suite.
Hurry, give me the phone,
While I`m still in heat.
 
Oh ride me like a stallion.
But leave me no back-bill.
Harder and faster,
Cunt, you must fulfill.
 
Give me partlinez.
Give me boards.
Give until you're dry,
To your majestic lord.
 
Thank you oh my k0de,
For callz that are free.
Was it as good for you,
As it was for me?

I am writing an essay on crackers, primarily on their psychological traits. 
As I have not personally come into contact with any crackers, I hope to get 
some discussion going about this. If you know a cracker, I would like to 
hear from you. Basically, I'm trying to build a psychological and personality 
profile of J.Random Cracker. Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated.

BTW, anyone know how I can get into contact with John Markoff,Katie Hefner or
Eric Bloodaxe?

[note: ERIKB IS A CRACKER!!!@!@!]

                    (Herbert B. East and AWWW Reporters)

[I fear for my life.  I've sent the letters now, and I will
ask the people mentioned in them for comments.  If I do not

DUMBO, TEXAS --  As  part  of an ongoing  project  on  the  study of the
computer  cracker sub-culture  conducted by  Associated World Wide Ware,
reporters  of AWWW  joined several  of these  "contemporary" hackers for
rides through the trash of large institutions, commonly dubbed "dumpster
diving".  Among  several documents of importance found, an AWWW reporter
uncovered  several letters which seem to  indicate that there is a high-
tech battle going around behind the average American's back.

The  documents printed  here tell  a morbid  tale of fame, technological
crimes and death.

                   Re: Subversive Activity Monitoring

Dear Ms. Herschwingoltz,

As requested by you, we have set watches over dominant members
of the computer underground.  Per your request, we are keeping
you informed about our activities daily.  Although you have
not specifically requested this, we are also billing on a daily
basis.

Included is our agent's report for Saturday, May 28th 1994.

09:00      Arrive at destination.  Vehicle: white telco-like
           van.  Arrival in middle of a violent argument
           between members of the subject's family, apparently
           about the family's telephone bill in general and
           the subject's "abnormal" (direct quote) telephone
           usage.  Argument ends with subject's modem confiscation.

09:10      In liue of above actions, depart and end monitoring.

In addition, we have compiled another profile and are including
it here.

PERSONAL DETAILS
****************
Name:      Ziki Daniels
Handle:    Rofus the Horrible
Age:       14
Sex:       Male
HDD:       3,000 megabytes
Speed:     14,400 bps

MODEM LIFE
**********
Ziki Daniels aka Rofus the Horrible ("RoH" hereafter) is the
vice-president of the local courier-ring, "The Texas Motherfuckers".
The identity of the president is not yet known to us, yet we hope
to find out more details about him from the RoH investigation.

SOCIAL LIFE
***********

CRIMES
******
! Although RoH is not personally responsible for the deprotection
of any software, he is the main force behind the spreading teams.
We have tapes of over 200 hours of communications (from a ten days
of tapping), all of which detail the transfer of stolen software.
! Also acquired from the data taps are proof that RoH calls
bulletin boards using several pseudonyms and harrasses their
operators.
! In the period we monitored RoH, he has joined and left
four "ANSI art" groups.  We have proof that RoH fakes other
artists' work in order to join these groups; furthermore, he violates
copyright status by copying his work from cartoons (the Donald
Duck syndrome).
!!! We appear to have stumbled upon the main supplier of the
Texas Motherfuckers.  Monitoring shows that RoH applies for (and
receives) jobs as a floor sweeper at various fast-food joints.
His favourite appears to be McDonald's stationed next to Eggheads.
Once that is done, we believe RoH drills holes in the toilets
and makes his way into the Eggheads, where he steals new software
(the zero day wares syndrome) and change.

NOTES
*****
Yesterday, we logged a call from RoH to a local packet-switching
network.  He failed to transmit the initializing sequence (two
carriage returns) and disconnected.  This should light a warning
light, however: if RoH begins to venture into other kinds of
computer crime, the Secret Service may get involved, and we may
have to step out.  We therefore recommend immediate action.  (End)

I would like to request again that you drop the request for "social
life" monitoring, as to date, none of the subjects seem to have
them.  We will continue reporting.

                                                Yours,
                                                Linda LeRoy

Barb,

Art and I have just cracked the code sent to us by the LLL firm.
I think you should view it ASAP and authorize action.  We will
be spreading the key across secure lines tonight.  The reason
it took so long was that they got smarter -- some letters translated
to two or three symbols, not one (N = /\/, K = |<, etc).

I found one item, a message from one Rofus the Horrible, to be
particularly disturbing.  I'm attaching it here:

Yoyoyo doods,

I robbed a gas station today.  Well, I like shot three people,
and one of them was this weiner with a suit (probably Bill Gates, L.L)
so I looked in his briefcase, and get what???  I found around
20 floppies!!!  Shit, most of them were boring stuff with numbers
(something about shares, and takeovers and other crap) but
there were some neat-o games.  I put them on this board, there's
Kong version 2, and another new version of DOS (or maybe not, I don't
really keep track) and some more stuff.  Anyway, since he's
dead, I guess it's -INFINITY WAREZ!!!!!!!  We made history boys.

"THE END"                                        (Clippings)

Local Dumbo man, Ziki Daniels, found dead in local apartment.
Medical reports suggest cardiac arrest.  Daniels was found
in an empty apartment, circled by diskettes of educational
software and a Peter Gabriel CD-ROM.  Police are looking for the
owner of the apartment, one Ikiz Slienad, a japaneese VGA coder,
who is still at large.

Daniels appears to have been a vice-president of a local gang,
and police do not rule out the possibility that his death was
part of a power struggle within that gang (3 other members of
the same gang were found dead under similar conditions).

       He thought he was ELEET because he knew the RDIST bug, but
     even the most KKOOL HAQER will lapse into a COMA after
     LEECHing more than fifty MEGZ of WAREZ from the FASTest board
     in town. After his little NAP he was LUSTing for some HOT
     CUMshot gifs that would WET his STUFF. But right then, GAIL
     Thackeray the fucking NARQ BUSTed into his room and said
     "LAMER we have your INPHO!" He was then rippled by searing
     LEAD bullets and drowned in a POOL of his own blood. When his
     daddy came in, he was worried that the CPS of the DL was too
     low, ignoring the FEDs in the room. He stopped downloading the
     latest BOW RELEASE, open a new COOL can of coors and called
     the NET and SAW WHO was on IRC. Everybody was gone - CIAO. His
     NICK was the only one. "WOW, those PHEWLs MUST be on HEU in
     Holland. Or was it this CCC congress?" He checked on EACH
     single LOOP, LOOKed on all boards and nobody he ever MET was
     there. HOW could that be, all the PHREAKs gone? He called
     another board to check for SUM AKSESS, but he failed the NUV
     cause his CRACK was not the FIRST release. He said MOO, ate
     his HAM, kissed his ROM, hugged his RAM, looked AT his LCOM
     screen and was dispatched by another catridge of gail's
     twelve-gauge. With a TAP he hit the floor.

-> *lorax* cool.. that takes a load offf my mind.. I am no scared to fight..
    but if they come at me all at once.. like those punks would do
*Lorax* No prob, sorry for the resend there.
*Lorax* I want to make sure I have people I can trust.

*Lorax* Cool, I "kinda" trust her - she's a bit looney, but if she says 
        someone is gonna help, they will.
-> *lorax* ok.. well thanks alot again.. I have to take off now
*Lorax* Or I could just buss in some of my redneck neighbors.  Give them a
        40 of bud, and a new plug of redman!
