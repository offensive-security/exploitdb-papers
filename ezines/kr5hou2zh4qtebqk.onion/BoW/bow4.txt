[April 1st, 1994]

   y0y0y0y0, Welcome to BoW #4, BoW's eagerly awaited fourth release.
I know, you have been trembling in anticipation. Well, here it is.. filling
up your hard drive and taking up room that could otherwise be used for
Commander Keen, sendmail 'WiZ' exploits, and other excellent warez.
   This months issue is alot bigger than all of the previous issues put
together.. I can hear the network analysts cowering in their corners muttering
something about bandwidth. They phear us. I can hear the head dudes at SPA
hiding in the store rooms, the only thing on their lips: "EYE PHEAR BoW",
"EYE PHEAR BoW", "EYE PHEAR BoW". They phear us.
   We now have an internet distribution site, cyberspace.com (where the real
cyberpunks hang out), look in /pub/defcon/BoW for old and new copies of BoW.
Thanks to Dark Tangent for being such a groovy cyberpunk as to let us put
our stuff there. He is krad. If I make it to DEFCON ][ I will buy him a beer.
   We are slowly taking over the information super highway. We are inside your
phone (Twilight of the Idols/Paradise Lost), we are on your Packet Switched
Networks (Secret Tectonics), we are on your ARPA/NSF/CA*NET nets
(cyberspace.com), We are on the front page of your magazines (look on the
cover of the April 1994 Issue of Gray Areas Magazine, who is that HaQr in
jail? You got it, check the name tag.. it's BoW's phearless leader... U4EA).
Phear us, soon we will be in your bed with your girlies.
   A few notes on back issues, BoW #1 is pretty much just a site and membership
listing, BoW #2 was released while I was on vacation, without my or U4EA's
knowledge/consent, however BoW #3 is very krad. Pick it up.

   A little feed back on BoW #3 (not made up!!!):
         Erik Bloodaxe - "I Want to get the TRAXSTER NARQ AWARD"
         Dale Drew     - "Wait a few years"

   In the works for BoW #5:
         - The BoW k0d3-MaNaG3R (eleEt AYcH-PeE UtIliTi3)
         - HaQr-LoC (USeD by CERT to KaTcH HaQrZ)
           (MaYBe.. BuG MiNoR ThReAT F0R Me)
         - DRe4mZ 0f THe GLoRiUS DaYS oF Th3 IBM-360
         - AnD LoTz LoTzZ M0RE!!!!!!#&*(*!#($@@!$&*@!$&*(_@!$*(&_1

   I won't take any more of your time, atleast not while you're watching, I
will wait until you are asleep.

  BoW Magazine is an electronic magazine published whenever we feel like it,
  specializing in Computer Deviency, Software Piracy, Computer Insecurity,
  Telecommunications Fraud, and other nasty things. The feds phear us.

  BoW Magazine is CopyWrong (K) 1994. Any unauthorized distribution is
  not krad, and we will get Netta Gilboa to mail your sysadmin and all
  kinds of other nasties if you distribute these electrons without prior
  consent of God. God can be reached in New York City, at the bus station.
  Drop by and ask him... then it will be ok. You can also distribute this
  magazine in an unauthorized fashion if either a) Your Mom, or b) A Real
  Cyberpunk say it's ok. Real Cyberpunks can be reached at the following
  email addresses: idol@well.sf.ca.us, president@whitehouse.gov,
  root@cert.org, and root@wired.com. If you don't have access to email, then
  call up a cyberpunk at the following phone number: 911. Ask them... they
  will ask you your name, and the nature of your emergency. Tell them you
  would like to distribute BoW magazine in an unauthorized fashion. They
  will be able to give you permission.

Submissions can be emailed to me, at pluvius@io.org, or can be uploaded
to our SUBMISSIONS BBS, Twilight of the Idols, see add at the end of this
issue. Alternately you can look for me on IRC, I have no life, I will
probably be there. Couple words on submissions: They must either be
amusing, or related to either hacking or phreaking, or preferably both
- articals on computer security, or telecommunications security are also
welcome. No "I GOT YOUR INFO" submissions please, and no more hate articals,
they are not nice.

NO CARRIER

SAD NOTE SAD NOTE SAD NOTE SAD NOTE:
   On a sadder note, two days ago, some BoW members were busted for
'hacking'. Nuclear Phusion and Panther Modern (along with Karb0n, and I have
heard also The Public, but I never really knew him) were raided on Wednesday
night. All their computer were taken but the authorities, and both Panther
Modern's and Karb0n's boards were confiscated. It is a sad day for BoW. You
may or may not know that all four were members of TNo, so it looks like we
will not be hearing from TNo for some time.  I have first hand knowledge from
DeadKat however, that CoTNo #4 *will* be released as soon as he has a copy
of the search warrant(s) to publish, along with the whole story. This is not
the time nor the place to mourn the losses of our friends, however BoW conveys
our condolences. BoW will get the feds. They phear us.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Note his bitterness at us using ddrew rather than d_d
2 - Note our genuine effort to get his feed back so we can make future
    BoW newsletters very krad.
3 - Dale does not like us perhaps? Does he jest? I am now confused!
4 - Yep, just checking, this is indeed the real thing..
5 - Now Dale moves the conversation in an attempt to pin recent sniffing
    activities on internet upon BoW, and to find a correlation between BoW
    and the Yorkshire Posse - sorry Dale, we are too krad to sniff, sysadmins
    phear us and give us free accounts anyway.
6 - Our phearless leader reminisces of his attempts to add to the 'PHaMoUZ
    AyCH-PeE d00dZ WHo aRE N0T iN BoW' .gif collection.
7 - Yes, it is true, ypcat was the YorkShire Posse's mascot long before it
    became a NIS utility.
8 - No futher messages from Dale. We shall have to wait until after this
    issue is released.

==============================================================================

    You ever go to call on of those eleet local 0-day boards, only to be
confrounted with the call-back verifier? Well, as every KRaD-WaReZz d00d
knows, you never give out your info except to NaRQ'z. So, until now, you
have just given up, and decided to stick to PD... well, have no phear,
BoW is here to solve all your worries... Call Back Verifiers can be HaQ-ed,
otherwise, my real name isn't Hackleb3ry Phin. Here are the required
ingredients:
   1 - A computer
   2 - A modem that allows the ATA command
   3 - A working phone line
   4 - A modem
   5 - A soundblaster
   6 - Bluebeep (any version)
   7 - A phone
   8 - The number to a K-RaD board with a call back verifier.
   9 - This artical for handy reference
   10 - Headphones for your soundblaster
   11 - A term program.
   12 - A mouse for use with bluebeep
   13 - An "I LUV BoW" t-shirt.

Instructions:
 Step 1 - Installation -
   Make sure that your computer is hooked up properly, the soundblaster is
   configured properly, and the produces tones through the head phones, and
   the modem is hooked up correctly, and dials WaReZz boards correctly.
   Make sure your term program is installed correctly and fully functions.
   Make sure your phone is plugged into the back of your modem, and your
   modem is hooked up to your phone line.
   Make sure you are wearing your "I LUV BoW" t-shirt. This is not optional,
   this procedure will not work unless you a wearing it.

 Step 2 - Configuration -
   Make sure your phone is with in close reach, as are your headphones.
   Start up BlueBeep. Go to the setup menu item, and select "Soundblaster Card"
   and toggle 'Soundblaster Present' to 'YES'. Now go to 'Edit Trunks' on the
   setup menu item, and cursor down to the first '-Unused-' entry.
   Modify this trunk to have the name 'HAQ-BBS', and the description
   'Ring Tones For HaQiNG BBS's' (case sensitive). Now modify Tone #01
   to have:
*  Freq1: 440, Freq2: 480, Freq3: 0, Length: 2000, Pause: 4000
   modify Tone #02 to have:
*  Freq1: 440, Freq2: 480, Freq3: 0, Length: 2000, Pause: 0
   You now have a trunk set that will play a ring tone (two rings). Press
   escape to return to the setup menu.
   Now select 'Edit Dial Sets', and modify the named entry 'MUSIC'. Change
   the name to 'BBS-HaQ', and the description to '1 - dialtone, 2 - ring tone,
   3 - busy tone', and then modify '1' to be the following:
*  Freq1: 350, Freq2: 440, Freq3: 0, Mark: 0, Space: 0
   and the modify '2' to be the following:
*  Freq1: 440, Freq2: 480, Freq3: 0, Mark: 0, Space: 0
   and finaly modify '3' to be the following:
*  Freq1: 480, Freq2: 620, Freq3: 0, Mark: 0, Space: 0
   Now you are all set.

 Step 3 - Connecting to target BBS -
   Now go into your term program, and dial the target BBS. For instance if
   the number to the board is 1-905-911-9119, then you would:
   ATDT*67,0-905-911-9119,,,,ELEETCODESHERE
   assuming that you have DNR on your line so that you can safely abuse
   the ELEETCODES off your line.
   Once connected, apply for new access, refer to BoW #3 for any of those nasty
   acronym's they sometime ask you for.
   *make sure that you give the BBS a number to call you back at that is not
   your real number*. My favorite is giving out numbers to really badly
   abused PBXs that will have trace-to-death capabilities on them, or numbers
   to internet dialins that have been HaQed to shit, and would also have
   trace-to-death capabilities on them. Ask your HaQr friends for an abused
   number to pass to the BBS.

Step 4 - Using the Call Back Verifier -
   Now sometimes you will be dropped straight into the CBV (call back verifier),
   and other times you must select it from the main menu, either way, get into
   the call back verifier. Answer all the questions appropriately, and then
   when it sais "calling you back" move on to the next step.

Step 5 - HaQiNG -
   Now the tricky part, this is where the Lamers are separated from the tr00
   BEe BeE 3SS HaQRz. When the board is about to drop carrier on you, very
   rapidly:
      1 - Pick up your phones handset
      2 - Exit your term program
      3 - Fire up BlueBeep
      4 - Select 'PHREAK OUT!' from the main menu
      5 - Press F1 and select the 'HaQ-BBS' trunk
      6 - Press F2 and select the 'BBS-HaQ' dial set.
      7 - Place the headphones against the handset so that the tones
          from bluebeep will be played into the phone.
      8 - When you hear your modem drop carrier (you are still online with
          the remote modem, but now your tones played into the handset will
          be fed to the remote modem), click your mouse on '1' on the
          dial pad in BlueBeep. Hold this down until you hear the remote modem
          dial your number.
      9 - Once you hear the remote modem dial the fake number, release the mouse
          button, and quickly press '+', this will start the ring tones.
      10 - Immediately afterward, press 'F10', this will drop you to DOS
           immediately after the ring tone has ended.
      11 - Once you are in DOS, fire up your term program, and enter 'ATA'
           at the modem command prompt.
      12 - Your modem will now reconnect with the remote modem, and usually
           you will be prompted for your password (don't forget this!).
      13 - You will now have full access!

NOTE 1: The above procedure works most of the time, but sometimes you will
        have to try it a couple times depending on the remote configuration.
NOTE 2: This will not work unless you are wearing your 'I LUV BoW' t-shirt.

As we all know, the messages in pretty much all the bases are, as Phaze said, 
incoherent.  Now, I have to admit, I don't mind this as long as the incoherent
ones are kept in any of the following bases:

General Base [Local]
Flame Base [Local]
General Base [PNR]
Sex with Bob [PNR]
Night Shade Fan Club [PNR]

Any messages which aren't even RELATED to the topic of the base (outside of 
these bases) will either be moved or deleted.  (Depending on my mood)

Come on guys!  Get that HP knowledge out and let's fuck those assholes! ...

Slider and i wound up doing stupid phreakin drunk of our ass during
bike week. dont let this happen to you.

                               FUN WITH MCI

We hit a series of pay phones, with MCI as there long distance carrier.
it started out simple.

STUPID PHREAKIN TRICK #1:
  Dialing 800 #'s with names instead of #'s

We were dialin stupid shit like 1-800-BLOW ME or 1-800-FUCK IT.
got to 1-800-EAT-SHIT. Well, we hit pay dirt. <or so our booze soaked
minds thought> anyhow....it had us listen to a series of stupid shit...
then it gave us a code. "cool!" we thought... wound up being as usless as 
tits on a bull. but we did learn something semi-important. almost all the 
1-800- type in a stupid saying had something to it. 
try it when you get bored.

STUPID PHREAKIN TRICK #2:
  Trying to hack MCI's collect call/charge to home phone # automated
  set-up.

We started calling any-odd long distance # and waited for "ROBO-RECORDING"
to kick in. "at the tone say your name" so we did. "joe...joe boner" but 
the rub was whe had pressed "1" right after the name.
"this is the shit..." it will tell our victim that joe boner is charging a
call to his mobile home. then the recorded "1" will kick in and activate
before our victim will get a chance to reply.
DUH, #2. nice try....didnt buy it. oh well...something u 3l33tists can
fuck around when the next presidential address or cable outage kicks in.

Well, i think there was more, but the "liquid medication" finally took
effect, and we went beachside to go "ho-hunting". cant really remember
if we took our stupidy to a new level.

|  modems are quite the thing these days... only the priveledged few have    |
|  them... but surprisingly, they are not that hard to get your hands on.    |

|  really fast modems built just for warez d00dz'.  I hear that their prices |
|  are quite reasonable.. for a catalog of their products to be sent to you  |
|  automatically, email them at president@whitehouse.gov, with the subject   |
|  line: "I LIKE GERBILS, PLEASE HELP ME", and a blank message body.         |

  Well, b0xing has not always been a big thing in the WaReZz d00d tradition,
however, it is a good way to keep in touch with aych-pee hommies to keep
the flow of 0-day k0d3z coming, and to also talk to other WaReZz d00dz to
discuss the up and coming warez. Typically red-b0xing has been a favorite,
because of its ease and safety. The recent advent of pay-video phones
has brought alot of questions my way, and Radikahl suggested that I do an
article for this BoW newsletter on it. Video fones offer so much more than
plain voice phones, for you can display your trendy 'I LUV WAREZ' or
'FREE POULSEN' tee-shirts, and also show the other person glimpses of the
0-day warez before you courier them to them. The problem with red boxing is
if the operator comes on and asks you to insert the coinage, it is very difficult
to use your handy dandy red-box (AKA Toll-Fraud-Device) to place to call.
This would seem to be a problem, however, after reading this article you
will realize that it is infact not. The way to red-box from these video phones
is quite simple, so simple that it is even possible for WaReZz d00dz to do it,
and is not limited to the realm of AyCH-Pe3-eRzZ. You red box a call on these
fones in the following manner:
      1 - Get a friend (or your mom if you have no friends) to video record you
          infront of the video phone, inserting a quarter into the coin slot.
      2 - Take the tape, and slice it into a continuous loop, so when played
          it shows you continuously inserting coins into the coin slot
      3 - Take a play back device of some sort to the video phone when you wish
          to place the call, and place it infront of the camera.
      4 - Dial the number
      5 - When asked to insert the toll, press play on your playback device.
      6 - When the call is cleared, remove the play back device from
          infront of the camera, and talk WaReZz.

A diagram follows to provide some clearity:

                  ___                 Camera
      WaReZz     *****     +-----+      |   +---+
      d00d  ->  ( o O )    |\     \     |   |\   \
      (you)      | ^ |     | \     \    |   | \   \
                 \ O /     |  \     \   \-> | O\   \
                  ---      |   +-----+      |   +---+
                 /   \     |   |     |  /---|   |   | <-- Video Phone
                        /->    |     |      \   |   |
                        |      |     |       \  |   |
                 Playback device              \ |   |
                                            /---+---+

 So now you should have no problems trading tips and discussing 0-day WaReZz
with all the other WaReZ d00dz, and keeping the k0d3z flowing from those
aych-pee hommies. Remember, OLD WAREZ ARE NO WAREZ. Stay 0-day...

  You constantly hear about Hackers, Phreakers, Ice Breakers, Koders
and other Electronic terrorists. Cable pirates are starting to make
their mark.

  The Cable industry CLAIMS that it looses millions of dollars every
year, yet it wastes almost that ammount in public service commercial
advertising on radio and television.

  Cable was designed in the mid 60's to get television transmissions
to hard to get areas where reception was either poor or non-existant.
Twenty years later, the cable industry has grown into a empire almost
as vast as AT&T or BELL Tel. Unfortunatly, as the empire grew, so did
its rates. The Government finally deregulated cable last october, but
unfortunatly the rates havent.

  I took a quick survey on the net on what the rates are in various
cities. My area <Daytona Beach, Fl> is 23.00$ a month for basic
service. in Charlotsville Virginia its 17.50 a month...in Chicago
Ill. it's 18.00$. in Fresno it's 21.00 a month.

  Now, i didnt have time to ask specific questions about channels,
quality, etc...but going on the channels i recieve, i'd be getting
fucked if i actually paid for cable.
When i lived in Boston, cable was 10.00$ less and about a dozen channels
more. See, in Daytona, you only get MTV, Weather Channel, A&E and some
other lamer channels.
Now, in the next town over, for a dollar less a month they get VH-1,
<well, they share it with BET> and some other semi-lame channels.
When i was in boston, we had MTV, VH-1, Comedy Channel, Sci-fi Channel,
a prevue guide and a on-line continious T.V. guide.

  During my investigation, i talked to a girl on the net, who had family
members who pirate cable. she had told me that it was on when the family
had moved in there and just didnt bother to have the cable co. install
it for the shear fact it was too damn expensive.

  but you ask: what does it all mean? if we keep pirating cable, wont it
drive up prices more? or hey, what's it hurt to pirate the cable? i'm
just one person....conclusion: it dosent matter. even though cable is
deregulated, the individual cable co. will have a specific rate, it will
be the only one in a specific town. <check it out, almost every town has
only ONE cable co.> so there is no compitition to lower or offer special
rates. But make no mistake, cable piracy is making a name for itself.
It will be right up there with Hackers, phreakers, etc...and besides...
if your a hacker, phreaker, 3l33tist or just lamer in training...
it's just plain fun. =)

Ron Post.

  DNR (dial numbers rapidly) is infact a very very elite thing to have on your
line.. what DNR does, is it dials the codes too fast for the telco's to
catch on, so they won't be able to bust you for abusing shit direct off your
line.  You will note that all the phamous phreaks had DNR on their line at
one time or another.  DNR is infact quite simple to have installed... you
can simply call up your telco, and ask for DNR to be put on your line..
(the operators and phone centers don't really know what it is, so will be
happy to have it added to your line).  Plus, DNR is completely free (just
like call blocking!). Once you have DNR installed on your line, you have
two choices available to you to use this feature... the first and simplist
requires a US Robotics compatible modem chipset. You must set your dialing
speed to the exact DNR speed. (just a bit faster than the fone companies
monitoring equipment, but slightly slower than the equipment that collects
the codes and verifies them!). This is done by adding the following to
your init string: S11=30, or by typeing in at your modem command prompt:
ATS11=30
your modem will respond with 'OK' provided that it has the USR chipset.
Now you can simply dial the codes right off of your line without phear
of the telco's being able to realize what you are doing! Say you had
the following eleet k0d3: 215-353-8238-5723, and you wanted to dial the
following Aych-pee bee bee ess: 602-911-9119, you would simply (depending
on the response time of your long distance carrier) you would enter the
following at your modem command prompt:
ATX1DT06029119119,,,,,,21535382385723
and provided that the code was krad, you would then be connected to the
provided eleet aych-pee bbs, and the fone company would have no record
of you abusing the codes direct off your line!
The second method, can be used when you don't have a modem handy, or
are dialing from your voice line. The only hang up is that you have to
go out and by the hardware. What you need to get, is one of those handy
33 memory tone-dialers from radio-shack (Radio Shack catalogue number 43-141)
some bateries for it (*SUPER* Alkaline tripple 'A' catalogue number 23-558)
and a replacement crystal for the crystal provided with the dialer (just like
when you want to make a red-box).  What you do, is you replace the crystal
with a just slightly *faster* crystal, so that the timing of the pause between
the DTMF digits is 30 ms, the correct timings for DNR. We will leave it up to
you to find the appropriate crystal, as we don't want every lamer and his
mom to be building DNR-boxes, because we don't want the fone companies to
figure out what is going on.
  Good luck, may the 0-day be with you....

         There once was a dude named Patrick Clark
         Rumours abounded that he was a narq
         Hp'ers were screaming "Oh Where can we go?"
         If this fuqn narq has acquired our info.

         All the hp'ers thought "Who can we trust?"
         This blind crippled vegetable's going to bust
         All our contacts and buddies, our neighbours and friends
         This narq must be silenced, we'll tie up loose ends.

         So the hp'ing posse, his house they had found
         No mercy for narqs, not even chair-bound
         They rolled up outside screaming "Death to the cripple"
         And then they attached a stungun to his nipple.

         The cripple was laughing, not how things should go
         But he rejoiced in the fact that he had their info
         His smile grew broader, his glass eye it shined
         In the sure-fire knowledge that they would be fined.

         Some of them wouldn't, for they'd go to jail
         Then Pat would receive a check in the mail
         For "services rendered", for busting these guys
         But still not enough to purchase new eyes.

         For this was Pat's goal, his ultimate aim
         To make enough money to get out the game
         And buy himself sight, to hell with the braille
         On which he had built his huge info-trail.

         Haqrz and warez d00dz, kodez kidz a-plenty
         Patrick had busted in excess of twenty
         His record was awesome, he'd busted them all
         But still he sat only a mere 3ft tall.

         The telco's they chatted, discussed and they chewed
         On an idea so terrible, so clever and shrewd
         The cost was enormous, so scary and dark
         but they all had the dream of a mighty ROBO-NARQ.

         7ft without stretching, and 20/20 vision
         All those evil haqrz would soon go to prison
         A bionic agent, a half-human fed
         With all haqrz busted the scene would be dead.

         But then what of Patrick? What then would he do?
         His narqing equipment might then turn on YOU!
         No haqrz to obtain their personal details
         No romantic interludes with robot females.

         His life would be over, no info to gain
         No juicy titbits that he could obtain
         No haqr records, life just wasn't fair
         Maybe he'd just stay within his wheelchair.

y0y0y0y0, it's just another k0d3-track..... k0d3z!
y0y0y0y0, it's just another k0d3-track..... yeah!

it goes a nine, one, one, phreak!

and it's just another k0d3-track
and suckas be thinking that they can trace this
but I'm gonna divert it at a higher level
'cause I'm inclined to meridians
coming out from dead ends,
y0y0 gonna bounce off a few telco's
who think they run the game,
But I learned to divert and delete,
all my tracks, my cover fully complete,
and so I warm my hands on the ashes of Bell
as I recall it's down fall
the break up in '84, that crushed us all..
but now we got all the different carriers today,
gonna fuqin bounce my call all over the place..

SS7 and ANI,
thinking they can trace me and you
but I know how to divert.. yeah..
gonna put this fuqin call through

worried about those fellows at CERT?
Divert, divert, and then divert..

SS7 and ANI
thinking they can trace me and you
but I know how to divert.. yeah..
gonna put this fuqin call through

Chorus:
