                 We wish all our friends a successful 1988!!!
                         and many new and good games.
                              /THE "ILLEGAL" TEAM


+ FANTASY GAVE UP +

Yep, only one week after their party, FANTASY, with FANTASY CRACKING (?)
SERVICE under his command sold his computer and gave up his cracking career.


CHANGES FOR 1988!

As you can see, and many of you will appreciate it, we decided to put more
English into your "ILLEGAL", just because we are not longer national, but
international and lots of our friends wrote: "...Thanx for the illegal, it was
cool (even though we can't read German)." and we notice that we had to change
something quickly. So the "ILLEGAL" is more English than German. We hope you
like it, if not or if you have any comment only let us know...
Yours. The "ILLEGAL" - TEAM.


BEING BLACKLISTED

Most of you know about conferences and the joy late night phoning brings, not
only can you talk to Americans who have never anything to say, but you can also
talk to your swapfriends in Europe for hours without ever having to pay a
funkilling phonebill. Some groups even arrange exclusive conferences with only
their members on it, a sort of a general meeting to discuss future plans. But
now the sad part! The American telephone company who runs the conference system
is called "Alliance" not to be confused with the American pirate group, and of
course Alliance knows that American hackers are calling for free, or freaking,
as it's called. For months they have tried to stop the hackers, but no success!
So now these so called "telephone executives" have decided to handle it
differently, instead of stopping the callers they are stopping the Europeans of
being called. They let their computers check which lines in Europe are called
more than normal and these numbers get a security check on them, they get
blacklisted as they enjoy conferences anymore, but also for the people that are
on the conferences when it crashes 'coz then the conference has to be put up
again. They've only been using this method for a short time, but already the
guys that get called a lot got blacklisted, among these are HUMAN of TDF, MAD
ALL of CFR, ROCKY + DSH of FAC, BRIAN of TFD...
But all is not lost, people that are blacklisted can still get added to the
conference if the operator is using 3-way, and the rumour has spread that the
blacklisting is only temporary, DSH and MAD ALL are on conferences again so
let's just hope that if they blacklist you that it's only for a short time,
because these cold winter nights are lonely without a regular confie.
                                                      Written by MAD ALL of CFR


COMPETITION 1987

Are you frustrated about the "ILLEGAL" - rankings from 1987, then watch out for
the SIGMA CREW'S demo to take part in their competition for 1987, where
everyone can win prices, not only the winners, even those who take part in it!
You have one vote per group and the last day you can vote is the 29th of
February 1988. You can vote for:

the best cracking group, the best demo creator, the most popular group, the
most disliked group, the best group's history (write SIGMA about your group's
history), the conference king, the best graphic artist, the best musician, the
most successful newcomer in 1987, and last and best over all group! So WATCH
FOR THE DEMO FROM SIGMA, NAMED SIMPLY "COMPETITION" AND GIVE YOUR VOTE!
                                                                  By SIGMA + JS


HEADING TO NUMBER 25!

Yep, it's true!

The next "ILLEGAL" will be the 25th one that I release from its beginning in
January 1986. Almost everything has changed. The 1st one had a circulation of
10 copies and now about 750 copies are spread (I'm sure there are more), but it
was, if one compares the standard, nothing to today's "ILLEGAL" co-produced by
RADWAR, COMMANDO FRONTIER and TRIANGLE. Even the language has changed, you
notice that? I'll try to put the next issue totally in English but think of all
the Germans who can't speak English, that's a problem, cause most of the
"ILLEGAL" is spread in Germany of course.

I have to thank PHOTONY from COOL COMBO (in my town) for borrowing me his
computer, because without his help you wouldn't hold this "ILLEGAL" in your
hands. My computer fucked off last night when I was writing articles, that's a
problem but now an unsolveable for Jeff Smart, eh, O.K. almost unsolveable. I
phoned MAD ALL for an hour from Photony's home (you'll wonder 'bout your
telephone bill) and had a real cool talk, hadn't we Allan? Special thanx for
this issue are going to: MR.PINGE from TRIAD and MAD ALL from CFR for sending
their articles by express (you don't have to do that, but I thank you...),
GENESIS*PROJECTS for the frontpage drawing (even though I get another one from
TRIANGLE (thanx), which was unfortunately too small...), my small printer for
printing, my fingers for writing, the SIGMA CREW for phoning to give some news
about their competition - just for fun from home without being in a conference
or so (you must have a nice bill, Paul!), all the guys who supported me with
news and rumours and good ideas, VELTINS PILS for their product, without it I
wouldn't have been in the right mood to write (you know what I mean) and
everyone else who feels responsible for the "ILLEGAL". Of course also to all
spreaders of this mag, especially to MAD ALL and the new German one YANKEE. Hey
BKA from RADWAR, I'm still waiting for your articles for this issue. I hope
they come tomorrow, 'cause I can't wait any longer. By the way: ALL GUYS HAVE
TO SEND THE ARTICLES FOR THE FORTHCOMING ISSUE UP TO THE 3RD OF FEBRUARY 1988.
PLEASE DO THIS OR I CAN'T GUARANTEE FOR GETTING THEM IN TIME AND PRINTING THEM
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT, O.K. ?

Yep, at the end of this week, everyone's coming to the RADWAR PARTY, even
FAIRLIGHT from SWEDEN and some guys from DENMARK, as I know TRITON TECHNOLOGY.
We are all hoping for TRIAD to come. HOTLINE and all Dutch ones are there and
of course the German elite, even the old stars like DYNAMIC DUO, FLASH and so
on. But we'll know better in the next issue, when I tell you which group I
joined (Got some hot offers).
                                                          LATER ON - JEFF SMART


NEWS FROM THE INNER SECTION...

YOHO! That's my new part, it was former "NEUES VON DER FRONT" and now as you
see above "NEWS FROM THE INNER SECTION" where I gathered all information about
you, your friends, you foes and everything else. Let's begin:

* RAW DEAL INC. is searching for NEW MEMBERS! All interested guys shall write
immediately to:
RDI, Postbox 93, 1940 BJORKELANGEN, NORWAY!

* After FANTASY'S DEATH, MCS and his SORCERERS went back to FCS. FANTASY gave
TSM all his modules to continue freezing. The main reason for giving away his
computer equipment was his girlfriend GABI. And how do the women thank you,
when you show them that you prefer them in front of a computer? They run away
with another boy like GABI did. Poor Daniel.

* MESSAGE TO TSM + MCS / FANTASY: I think Daniel will wonder about his
telephone bill when he gets it.

* IKARI IS ONLY ABLE TO FREEZE?
All programmes were freezed with FREEZE MACHINE! That's bad guys! Now one
understands that IKARI wasn't able to release a multi-load game yet. Mor facts
about that in the forthcoming "ILLEGAL" No.25.

* By the way, FCS is planning their next copyparty on the 5th of March 1988.
Will that party be another success? Let's wait and see.

* LUKULLUS (EX-FCS) joined THE WANDERER GROUP. He's another heavy damage to the
sinking FCS-SHIP.

* Yep, and NEW IMPORTS join probably FCS or they start a new group together
with THE DARKNESS.

* THE DEADLY FRIENDS / NORWAY now consist of: LAFFEN, GEIR both EX-RAW DEAL and
HUMAN (EX-CFR). They fight a war against Coco's A.C.E., especially against the
EX-GUARDIANS INC., now FIRKIN.

* MR.ZER0PAGE, DETONATOR and RUB / TWG are going to fly to the U.S.A. in their
summer-holidays - just for fun. Maybe they visit MARCEL (real FAC) and AVE
(TRIANON?)!? I van only scream: Wait! Take me with you!

* JEFF SMART left THE FANATIC DUO and will probably quit swapping, but not
without joining another real famous group.

* DAVE from THE WARRIORS, who are a member of SPG, quit his career on the 64 to
enter the world on the ATARI ST.

* AMIGO from THE CONNECTION (AMIGA) lost. The police whished him a happy new
year in the software prison.

* SCOOTER who was formerly (in the stone age) a TFD member isn't that any more.
He was thrown out, 'cause of his rinkleface and his stupidity. He changed his
name into HARDCORE and this says all.

Every month I'll try to publish a funny excerpt out of a conference. This time:
TAG (Dave + Chris) + J.S.

DAVE: What's up, Jeff?
JEFF: My dick.
DAVE: Then not much is up.
JEFF: Hey, you haven't met my dick yet.
DAVE: Send me a photo.
JEFF: A photo is too small for my dick.

RUMOURS OF THE MONTH
can be true or false, eh?

Word spread that JEFF SMART was catched by the police, but he's still acting as
before...

Word spread that the same guy gave up swapping, because he fears a war with
D.S.I. THAT'S WRONG!

Word spread that HANSEATIC CRACKING ASSOCIATION made a demo different to all
their oters before. Before they made demos with a simple Koala-picture, a
simple Soundmonitor-sound and a simple scroll text on the top of the screen.
Now they changed their demos totally: they consist now of a simple Koala-
picture, a simple Soundmonitor-sound and a simple scroll text on the BOTTOM of
the screen. THAT'S TRUE.

Word spread all those guys, who didn't show up at TRIAD & FAIRLIGHTS COPYPARTY
have died a horrible death in India. THAT'S WRONG ISN'T IT?

Word spread that RADWAR employs some doctors to keep all the drunken guys at
their party on the 9th of January alive, THAT'S TRUE, EH?

Word spread that NEW EDITION was angry 'cause they believe in being number one
in Germany. THAT'S TRUE.

Word spread that US GOLD released OUTRUN 2 already. THAT'S ABSOLUTE FUCKING
RUBBISH. YOU LAMER.

Word spread that the post invented a new sticker for all Mega-Hyper-Super-
Special-Extrafast-Sendinx (look below). THAT'S RUBBISH, TOO, because this
sticker was invented by MR.PINGE from TRIAD to persuade the lamers at the post
office to send his letter faster and it has worked! With all the best whishes
                                                                     Jeff Smart

|     _VERY IMPORTANT_       |

HELLO, DUDES...

This is SWYX from TRIANGLE. Since we seem to be a very popular group at the
moment, I'd better write something about ourselves this time!

We are getting letters in which we're asked: "Do you wanna trade with me"
almost every day. (I think many of you big guys out there have the same
problems, right?) Well, some of these letters are from quite famous groups, but
most of them are from smaller groups, also known as "LAMERS"! I'm the one who
daily go to open our postbox and I'm gonna be tired of getting all those lamer-
letters, coz all of them write something like this: "If ya don't wanna swap
with me, then please return my discs"! But how can I? It would cost me a
fortune to return all those discs again! We simply can't afford to send back
all of 'em. So read this carefully: those who aren't worth trading with, will
not have their discs back a second time! I can name a few guys who wrote us
lately and either have got our response or will get it very soon: THE WANDERER
GROUP, THE SHARKS, THE SIGMA CREW etc.. We see these guys as cool and famous so
of course we want to trade with them. Well, enough about letters, just a little
note to all the "disc-supplying" guys: THANX!

And now something sad...

I have decided to stop swapping, 'cos I'm too busy and it's too expensive! The
only groups I'm going to trade with in the future are:

RADWAR / THE LIGHT CIRCLE
TRIAD (IXION!)
THE FANATIC DUO (long live the brotherhood!)

The rest will be contacted by the other swapper in Triangle, SCRATCH, very
soon! We might get a new member, who will trade as well very soon. So we can
keep all our contacts and even get som new! What am I going to do in the future
then? Well, things like cracking, writing for this great magazine and working
on the game, CHIX and I has planned to do! And of course concentrate more on
school! (My teachers are gonna love me!) I wanna leave ya all now, but before I
say "GOODBYE" a few notes to some people:

OSI / FAC: No more trading, don't fuck my good friend Jeff Smart or anybody
else in "TFD".

HOTLINE: Please contact us, we wanna trade with you!

IXION / TRIAD: Thanx for a great party, hope to see ya soon, dude!

And, dear audience, don't forget to vote for our "DEMO OF THE YEAR", you have
time until 22nd of January 1987 (one vote a group) and keep in mind that not
only the winning group will get a price, but one of the audience too, who will
be pushed by random. First people liked TRIAD, DEXION, TFD and even ours the
best, but you'll see the final rankings soon.

That's it, see you in the next issue, where I'll write a longer and much more
interesting article than this time! You'll see my adress on the last page, so
don't hesitate - write!
                                                  GOODBYE says SWYX OF TRIANGLE

INTERVIEW OF THE MONTH! THIS TIME: RADWAR / TLC

In the neverending series (no! not "DALLAS") I interviewed this month MWS from
RWE. Here are the answers (not always serious to my questions):

JS:  Who does belong to RADWAR?

MWS: We are: MWS (19 years), AVH (18), BKA (18), TC (18) and DEF (21)

JS:  Who invented the name?

MWS: It was me and FLASH on the phone at the end of 1985.

JS:  What were your first products?

MWS: We invented the BORDER SPRITES as the first together with FLASH in FCG and
our 1st crack was "NEVERENDING STORY" (for RWE), we cracked more games for FCG.

JS:  Which computers do you own?

MWS: I personally only a 64, but the others all have an Amiga.

JS:  What happened to you in Munich?

MWS: I want to send many greetings to the guys who spread the rumours that I
was in the Dutch Army or emigrated to USA or had to pay 100.000 DM, I was
sitting the whole time on my girlfriend. Thanx to BKA and AVH for keeping this
secret, and special thanx to JAN / YETI and mother for the fine food and Jan's
SISTER for the hot adventure evenings.

JS:  What was the reason for starting again after the break?

MWS: The rumours about me were totally going on my nerves, so I decided to keep
on computing, the first game I cracked after that period was "Nosferatu" and
AVH finished his INTERLACE.

JS:  Do you have any war?

MWS: No, we are a friendly group but WILL FROM HOTLINE will get a special
christmas present from RADWAR SURPRISES.

JS:  What is your favourite music, game and movie?

MWS: Music: Depeche Mode & New Order
     Game: Beachhead
     Movie: "Dirndljagd auf dem Huhnerhof"

JS:  What do you do in your freetime?

MWS: TC cares about his girlfriend, his Amiga and his car, AVH cares about his
school career, me, Amiga / 64 and his Taekwondo Club. DEF us working at the
post office and he bought a color-printer for his Amiga tp print naked photos
of his girlfriend. BKA is always worried about not formatting his "LODERUNNER"-
Disk otherwise his father will be angry. If I'm not working on the 64 I am
dancing a lot, I often crack jokes on the telephone, kill my little brother and
shape my girlfriend.

JS:  SEE YOU ON YOUR PARTY!

Next "ILLEGAL" will present you an interview with our crackers of the year:
TRIAD (MR.PINGE & JANITOR)


RIDDLE OF THE MONTH

And again another "RIDDLE OF THE MONTH". The same docs as from the preceding
month. Try to seek out the terms and place a circle around them; when you found
all terms, then read the remaining letters from left top to the right bottom
and you have the solution! And now: Do it! The solution from the last month
was: "CONGRATULATIONS, MAN!" And this time it's... Try to find it on your own!

HELLO TO ALL FRIENDS!

You know, even though I left THE FANATIC DUO, I'll keep on writing the
"ILLEGAL" as before, of course, bu I don't know if I'll swap in future. But
I'll tell you at once if I'm sure. Here are the greetings for this month, BIG
HELLOS TO:

MR.PINGE from almighty TRIAD (cool sticker on the last letter), CF + ACCEPT of
BEASTIE BOYS, DAVE + CHRIS from THE AWESOME GUYS, HOTLINE'S SLEDGEHAMMER, THE
still WANDERING RUB and SPC, IAN from conFUSION, old LAFFEN from THE DEADLY
FRIENDS, SWYX of TRIANGLE, JAYCE from DCU (R U still waiting?), RADWAR
SURPRISES, MR.ZEROPAGE, (hugh!), RUN from SCOUSE (happy new year!), SOLDIERS
AGAINST PROTECTION 2:1, IKARI warriors NIK and JUST ICE, DRS & COCO of A.C.E.,
SCOOPing TMC, all German exams passing MAD ALL from CFR, the rest of FCS (Halb
eins, Ihr Idioten), THE DARK DARKNESS, TWR from SRG, RAW DEAL INC., THE flying
SHARKS, GENESIS*PROJECTS, SIGMA-CREW (what 'bout some conferences), detonating
DETONATOR, OLD IMPORTS, FAIRLIGHT'S GOLLUM, THE TARTAN ARMY (Scottie - beam me
over), TSK, TAU, DN-CREW, ROBIN HOOD (HA!) and all I've forgotten here.
                                                                             JS


MAD ALL'S MAILBOX

- What a lucky guy SWYX of TRIANGLE is, he's just got a FREE American modem
from a yank. The only thing he has to do is to upload now and then. Some guys
have all the luck.

- CCS who seem to get in a heavier war with TLS as each day passes have changed
their name into FUSION.

- Well, well, well, what a visit to the PCW show can amount to is amazing, MAD
69, composer of suburbia among other jewels has landed himself a job with a
softwarefirm, coz he took his musix and blasted it at everyone.

- There seems to be a real black market these days in our scene, exclusive
utility programmes that are for private use only seem to be available with
certain people who will remain nameless. Hot items seem to be "Rockmonitor 5"
by USA-TEAM and "TMC's music editor" available against the wishes of the
authors.

- Does IKARI live in a softwareshop? One could get the impression all right,
the last month they have been releasing 10 games a week, must be nice living in
England.

- Jeff Smart is seriously thinking 'bout putting a lot more English pages into
the "ILLEGAL", sounds reasonable, after all Germans can read English, but most
pirates can't read Goete's language, so get your claims to put more English in
and write it to Jeff.

- IKARI'S visit to the continent was a great success, when they arrived at
Venlo they almost got mugged by everyone who wanted to meet 'em, some guys even

asked them to sign their sportbags. And they enjoyed Venlo so much that they
promised me to come every two months and Pal, who was missed by some, wants to
join them (NIK & JUST ICE) next time.

- RADWAR'S party seems to come along pretty well, lots of guys are said to
come, but the big question will be if pirates can dance, read the next
"ILLEGAL" for a full report.

- With the arrival of "ARKANOID" on the Amiga the wait for arcade conversions
seems to be coming to an end, coinsiding with the launch of the Amiga 1000,
back in the stoneages, there were some arcade conversions released, but then
there was a 9 month wait for another decent conversion. Let's hope we don't
have to wait another 6 months for something else.

- After people told that our X-MASS disk was a quite great success, we will
eventually bring out and EASTERN DISK, too.

Well, this is the end of yet another mailbox, let the gossip come, just write
in and let us know, we do not care who you are, if your gossip is good and
trustworthy. I will print it and give you a special mention... Watch this
space, yours sincerely

AND NOW... THE WEATHER BROADCAST!

Lads and Gents, you have to expect in the following heavy down falling of
Isepic because temperatures will fall below the Freeze-Frame-Point. Mainly in
the zeropage one has to expect slight falling of zerobytes, so better buy a
speeding system. In the ranking list Munich is leading with 9 cracks without
module, followed from Cologne with 5 cracks.

And now the traffic outlooks: Be very careful! On Track 18 a 23rd Read Error
comes upon you. On the 9th of January: 30 kilometres traffic jam near Heinsberg
because of a party. And now we continue our night sessions with music from...
                                                            MWS / CRM CREW / JS


JEFF SMART LEFT TFD

O.K., if you heard it or not, I'll tell you again that I left THE FANATIC DUO,
because in my opinion everything depended only on me and then came the school
(the following year is very important for me), so I quit TFD and I'll quit even
swapping with most of my friends. But my friends will get a personal letter, as
they used to get such letters from me. But before you start asking: what about
"ILLEGAL" Jeff? I tell you that I keep going on producing it of course. Well,
I'm thinking about joining a real famous group, but I'm not sure, because the
problem that I can't live without getting brandnew stuff, but I'll tell you the
final development of me in the next issue, that's promised (and you know I keep
all my promises - almost). O.K., other things now: Heard about that weekend
when Brian / TFD and me stayed at Radwar's place together with Mr.Zeropage,
when we went to the disco "La Quinta", where the RWE-Party takes place and
Brian's eclipse? (hehe) The thing was that Brian drank too much beer (in fact
it wasn't so much, but he can't bear a lot) and you imagine what we had fun
with Brian who vomits in MWS' house. But you'll read about that in English in
the next issue, cause I really decided to put the "ILLEGAL" totally into
English, but I'm sure wheter this works, but you'll see it any way. Well, I'm
waiting for some comments about my English (that's the main problem for keeping
the whole magazine into English), 'cause I think it has to be improved, eh? But
please write how you like you "ILLEGAL" the more? In English like all the
pirates do or in German like Germans do? Of course it's better to write it in
English, 'coz more guys understand English than German, don't they? But the
next "ILLEGAL" comes as surely as "IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2" from EPYX. Now we are
expecting cold winter months with not much games and many boredom. See you at
all big parties, yours
                                                                     Jeff Smart


BUY OR DIE???????

Many guys are wondering about those arselicking wankers who wrote to you and
order you to buy software for silly high prices aren't you? And many guys are
wondering about this EAGLESOFT in the NETHERLANDS, who have advertisements in
famous computermagazines, even in Germany. They promise you the newest American
stuff for only 8 German marks per disks, that's about less than 4 Am. dollars.
But do we really need stuff from E.S.I.? Don't we get everything faster through
the modem? I bet we're all faster than those guys. What have MITCH done to let
those lamers join his group? Here's the adress of them which can be found in
almost every computer magazine: EAGLESOFT INC., P.O. BOX 659, 6130 AR SITTARD,
HOLLAND. Perhaps MITCH doesn't know about that, so please tell him that when
you meet him, O.K.? When you look down, you find a German letter from idiots,
called "SOFTWARE CLUB" who wrote to SEVEN UP in order to sell games to 4 German
marks per game, but when you study the games on their list, you can only laugh
("A"UT-RUN). You laugh louder when you hear that this list represents their up-
to-date games from the 16th of December '88. You fall down because of too much
laughing when you recognize up to 15 mistakes in writing, I bet this is a 12
year old boy, who thinks he's the boss and can sell his "great" games to become
a rich sucker. So let these guys burn in hell, eh?
                                                                             JS


THE VENLO-MEETING ON 19.12.87

Hey! Those VENLO meetings become more and more famous. They became so famous
that I was there for the first time and it wasn't the last time. I went
together with almost the whole RADWAR-CREW, MR.ZEROPAGE and BRIAN to the school
where the part started att 11 o'clock in the morning. The room was overcrowded,
about 250 guys were counted and it was (if one looks at the names of the guys
who showed up) one of the best parties ever held. First of all BRIAN sat down
to TMC from SCOOP and both programmed like hell. I talked a lot to my very good
friend MAD ALL from the Belgian coast, who brought along with him, and that was
the sensation for Venlo, two guys from IKARI, who travelled over from England
just to come to Venlo. As you can imagine JUST ICE and NIK were asked from
every Dutch lamer (and there were quite a lot) to swap with them ("SWAP WITH
ME. I AM VERY GOOD WITH SOFTWARE."), but they stayed cool. Of course, I talked
to SLEDGEHAMMER from HOTLINE, my old friend. A complete list (?): SOFTRUNNER
GROUP, CFR, HOTLINE (of course), IKARI, RADWAR, FCS, TWG (RUB - the duck +
SPC), even COCO from A.C.E., SCOOP, KGB, the real FAC and so on. I guess you
already heard about that thing with D.S.I. and me (Jeff Smart). I knocked
Marcel from D.S.I. (unfortunately Rene', this sucker, wasn't there) down with a
hit on his nose so that he had to leave this room for a short time and to stop
the bleeding of his nose.

MESSAGE TO RENE' OF D.S.I.: IF WE MEET AGAIN, YOU'LL DIE! SO BE VERY VERY
CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU SAY AND DO OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY OR TO DO ANYTHING
MORE, YOU UNDERSTAND?

There was quite good stuff for the Amiga, too. WILL from HOTLINE, was sitting
on "BACKLASH" like chief sitting bull himself and didn't want to give it out.
Everyone was angry! Imagine of the speed: JANITOR cracked "BANGKOK KNIGHTS" on
17.12.87 and we had it two days later. An express sending from Sweden takes
normally three or four days. The solution: FAC imported it through modem from
the U.S.A. who got 1 days before from TRIAD through modem, that's what I call:
technological development! At four o'clock the thing was over, much too soon,
the party was much too short for a real party. Everyone was satisfied, the
small Dutch kids, who had new stuff, the bigger kids, who met their idols and
the biggest kids, who met their good friends from thousand conferences. MZP
bought "FLYING SHARK" from IKARI to crack it alone at home, because there was
too much trouble as we know that from crackers in BONN (Guess who?), but there
was no chance, try to crack, when 20 kids are standing around you and crying:
"Do it, I want that game!". We're waiting for the next Venlo party!
                                                                            JS!

GAME REVIEWS PAGE!

We also offer the game reviews now in English, isn't that good? Let's begin:

FLYING SHARK / FIREBIRD: It's one of the best games released from Firebird for
ages. A cool and great conversion from the Taito arcade version with big
motivation. Watch out for a High Score from MZP. Score: 90 / 100

CHAMONIX CHALLENGE / INFOGRAMES: Infogrames, notorious for their shit
adventures surprised everyone with their mountain climbing simulation which is
really super, even the graphics. The programmes haven't forgot any detail of a
real climber. Score: 92 / 100

BANGKOK KNIGHTS / SYSTEM 3: the long wait wasn't quite worthwhile, 'cause the
game offers nothing new to the players, except very large sprites, but always
the same like "IK +" and so on. The worst Robb Hubbard sound for months.
Disappointing Score: 83.

SIDEWALK / INFOGRAMES: Another big surprise from the French company, who begin
to reach today's standard. It's a very funny game about a hidden motor bicycle.
Score: 87.

RAMPAGE / ACTIVISION: Well, it's not bad, it was converted quite good and one
can accept it. Score: 85.

HUNTER'S MOON / THALAMUS: another gamer from Thalamus, which deals, of course,
about a spaceship in the space. Without docs, score: 81.

STRIKE FLEET / LUCASFILMS: the follow up of "PHM PEGASUS", the same game type,
the same good graphics and the same challenge without an instruction file,
score: 86.

MAD BALLS / OCEAN: same game like BOUNDER. Jumping with a ball and kicking off
other balls, but nevertheless I like it because of its funny sprite and a funny
titlesound (FG). Score: 84.

OUTRUN / US GOLD: frustrating graphics, but one was in fear of that. But it's
faster than one thought it to be, only a frustrating: 76.

GARFIELD / THE EDGE: with very good animations and fine graphics, but with a
lousy game you can score: 81.

DEFLEKTOR / GREMLIN GRAPHICS: A new game idea! That's always brilliant. It's
quite difficult to destroy all balls with a laser, but it's quite good. Score:
83.

COSMIC CAUSEWAY / GREMLIN GRAPHICS: the follow up to "TRAILBLAZER", one likes
it, one likes it not, it's now more a shoot-them-up than a move-and-jump. It
lost of its playability because of only a one player option. It scored: 80.

WWF WRESTLING / nice idea: a wrestling with digitized graphics, but a very
shhitty joystick-movement. Score: 65.

ROLLERBOARD / 1001: nice graphics , but it looks anyway similar to "KIKSTART"
as you have to drive and jump on mountains etc., scoring: 76.

GAUNTLET 2 / US GOLD: If one only looks to the game you see no differences to
"Gauntlet I", do you? Does US GOLD have a Gauntlet-Editor or what? This scores:
73.

SKYFOX 2 / EA: Another follow-up, this time you fly and shoot your enemies in
the space, really fine graphics but too difficult. Score: 78.

KNIGHTMARE / ACTIVISION: Well, another adventure with pure joystick movement,
but its graphics are good but game is hardly to solve, achieving a score of 81.

DISCOVERY / CRL: nice shoot em up with many games within the game, Score: 79.

MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE / GG: it looks like "Gauntlet" but with better graphix,
but please not another HEMAN - GAME, 3 are enuff, so He-Man scored: 75.

INSIDE OUTING / THE EDGE: it looks like the old Spectrum-games like "The great
escape", but it's the first in colours. This makes such games interesting: 79.

PSYCHO SOLDIER / OCEAN: the follow-up to sucking "Athena", but it doesn't look
bad, much better than "Athena": 69.

BONE CRUNCHER: funny game, eventhough not the best graphics, scoring: 68.

RAINBOW DRAGON: old game idea new programmed, nothing special, only 61.

DRILLER / ACTIVISION: slow, "ELITE" like game with Vectorgraphix. Score: 58.

DEJA VU: Adventure coming from the Amiga, on which it's better, here: 62.

ANDY CAPP: funny, eventhough the graphix is losing, but he drank 59 pts.

I ALIEN: Yep! Another shoot-them-up on platforms, quite funny, scoring: 64.

OUT OF THIS WORLD: it's from Mastertronic, this means here: 43.

HUNT FOR THE RED OCTOBER: well, it looks quite interesting, but it cannot beat
"SILENT SERVICE" at all, so: 66 points.

SUPER G-MAN: O dear! Another old game idea, more a SIMPLE G-MAN: 39.

GALACTIC GAMES: What did ACTIVISION do? We expect now the worst for "SUPER HANG
ON", GALACTIC GAMES is nothing. Shitty graphix, shitty joystick movements, but
nice sprites: 18 pts.

LAWN TENNIS / MASTERTRONIC: It's unplayable eventhough the graphic is done very
well, game, get and 31.

FRUIT MACHINE: what shall I write about this? It looks sadly, so I give 20.

ASTERIX, BLUE BERRY and LUCKY LUKE: To the company: Please do not give out any
other games like that! They are absolutely fucking rubbish: ASTERIX: 12, BLUE
BERRY: 7 and LUCKY LUKE: 3 points at all.

DEAD OR ALIVE: It looks damned like "HIGH MOON" but it's too slowly: 23.

JACK THE RIPPER / CRL: What do you think about textadventure with an
instructionsbook? Yes, the same as I do, with a nice titlepic it scored: 25.

EYE GAME: What shall I do with a bad English question and answer game? 10.

TRAPDOOR 2: I hope that PIRANHA doesn't believe their greatest success and make
another follow-up, it's SHIT: 4 points.

720 DEGREES: every word is too much for this shit: 1 lonely point!

FORTRESS UNDERGROUND: it sucks: NIL!

                                                all reviews done by Jeff Smart.

ABOUT THE TRIAD + FAIRLIGHT COPYPARTY FROM THE 18.-21. DECEMBER '87

A short survey of this great event was brought to all of you wo didn't show up
here by MR.PINGE from TRIAD.

YES, THE PARTY STARTED ON THE 18TH DEC. AND WE WERE EXPECTING A LOT OF PEOPLE
BUT UNFORTUNATELY EVERYONE DIDN'T SHOW UP CAUSE MANY DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO
TRAVEL THE LONG WAY TO SWEDEN. MAYBE THE PARTY WAS ARRANGED AT THE WRONG TIME,
NEAR CHRISTMAS AND A LOT OF OTHER PARTIES AROUND.

WELL, ANYWAY THERE WERE ABOUT 180 GUYS AT THE PARTY BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF
SWEDISH LAMERS TOO.

HERE ARE SOME OF THE GROUPS FROM THE PARTY:

TRIANGLE (THE COOL DEMOMAKERS FROM DENMARK.), THE PAPILLONS (THE FAST CRACKERS
FROM DENMARK TOO.), ZETREX (EX WIZAX), 2000 A.D (ANOTHER COOL DANISH GROUP),
DOMINATORS (ALSO FROM DENMARK), PUREBYTE (THE OLD LEGEND FROM FINLAND), THE
SHADOWS (FROM NORWAY) AND SOME MORE GROUPS PLUS A LOT OF SWEDISH GROUPS AND OF
COURSE TRIAD AND FAIRLIGHT!!!!!

YOU SEE NOT MANY FAMOUS GROUPS BUT WE HAD A REAL FUN ANYWAY SO THE PARTY WAS
HELD IN A BIG SCHOOL IN HUDDINGE NEAR STOCKHOLM!!

TRIANGLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED THEIR DEMO-COMPETITION-DISK AT THE PARTY BUT
EVERYTHING WASN'T FINISHED SO I HOPE THEY WILL RELEASE IT VERY SOON. TRIAD HAS
ALSO MADE A PART FOR THAT COMPETITION SO WATCH OUT!!!

A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE BUSY CRACKING A LOT OF GAMES AT THE PARTY AND WE (TRIAD)
AND FAIRLIGHT HAD AS USUAL A REAL COMPETITION WHO CRACKED THE GAME FASTEST.

SOME GROUPS ALSO MADE SOME DEMOS THERE AND SOME OF US WATCHED VIDEO-FILMS TOO.
WE AND FAIRLIGHT EVEN TRANSFERED SOME CRACKS TO U.S.A BY MODEM AT THE SCHOOL
TELEPHONE. AS YOU MAYBE COULD READ WE HAD A REAL NICE TIME THERE. A PROBLEM FOR
ME WAS THAT I NEEDED TO LEAVE ONE DAY BEFORE THE PARTY ENDED CAUSE THE PEOPLE I
WAS TRAVELLING WITH WENT ON THE SAME TRAIN-TICKETS. SO I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT
THE LAST DAY BUT I'M SURE IT WAS A COOL DAY TOO. SO TO ALL OF YOU WHO DIDN'T
SHOWED UP: DON'T MISS A PARTY FROM TRIAD & FLT AGAIN CAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS
SOMETHING COOL HAPPENING THERE!!

BYE AND THANX FOR READING THIS ARTICLE!
                                                      SIGNED: MR.PINGE/TRIAD!!!
