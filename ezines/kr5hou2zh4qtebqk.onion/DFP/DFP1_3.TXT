I was glad to see this comment.  Given the fact that "the net" now en-
compasses everything from Crays to AppleIIs, cooperation between admins
and users (even in mundane matters such as electronic mail) is more
necessary than ever before.

I was puzzled, however, when I continued reading this issue of DFP.  Even
after you alluded to the importance of foreknowledge, discussion, and
cooperation, you wrote this:

>Accessing and using equipment that you do not own is okay as long as
>you do not prevent those who own it from using it, or damage anything.

How does a remote hacker KNOW the results of his actions?  How will the
remote hacker KNOW if he causes damage?  How does the remote hacker KNOW
that he is using one of a limited number of access ports?  The simple answer,
in many cases, is that he does not, and will not, know the results of many
of his actions.

I have watched hackers attempt to bring my system to a halt through both
subtle and gross methods.  have watched hackers muck about aimlessly in
user files, erasing/corrupting them at random.  There are some types of
files which can be corrupted by simply opening them with an editor!

[ Editor's comment: How does a hacker know? By trying it and seeing what
happens, of course, or by reading information, asking others. Same way
everyone else learns. Now why would a hacker try to bring down your system?
Hackers *LIKE* computers. Just because someone was trying to cause you harm
does not mean that all hackers are vandals. Perhaps you could post some
guidelines on your machine, for example a list of files not to be opened
with the editor, and ways that those files could be viewed, etc.]

>Sure he got the source code for VMS, but is there any evidence
>that he used this information for personal gain, or did he simply use the

This is a moot point.  The source code for VMS (or any commercial operating
system) is a copyrighted work.  By securing his own copies, he violated that
copyright law and deprived DEC of revenue.  There are any number of books
available for loan/purchase which give details of operating system design.
I have seen several such texts which explicitly document VMS internals.
Why weren't those texts an acceptable alternative?

[ Editor's comment: You mean Kevin M. would have bought a copy of VMS,
but since he was able to just take it, he deprived them of revenue? I do
not think so. He never would have bought it. DEC has the same amount of
money no matter if Kevin had the code, or not.
    However, I would be interested in that information you have on the
VMS internals.]

>Who owns the Internet?

There is no single entity to which we can assign the label "Internet".  The
"Internet" is, in reality, is a conglomerate of cooperating networks.  Some
of these networks, such as SURANet, are regional networks; these are funded
by their members.  Others, such as THEnet, are limited to a single state;
these are often funded by the government of the State in question.  Others
are not really "networks" at all; uucp, which is based on store-and-forward
via telephone calls (rather than a constant connection over a leased line),
is a good example.  There is a "backbone" which connects many of these par-
ticipating networks; it is known as NSFnet, and it is maintained by the
National Science Foundation.  Many nets which participate in the "Internet"
are commercial; HP, DEC, and IBM have gatewayed their internal networks to
the "Internet".

There may be parts of this conglomerate for which we can determine owner-
ship.  Obviously, HP's network belongs to HP, while THEnet belongs to the
State of Texas.  Their participation in large-scale networking does NOT
effect any change in their ownership of their own networks/systems.

>Is it some mysterious 'them'
>or is it our net?

It is, most assuredly, NOT "our net".  The mere fact that we can access
a facility does NOT imply that we have any rights/privileges whatsoever
on that facility.

Actually, the fact that a network connects two sites is irrelevant.  The
question is a simple one: Have the operators/owners of that site granted
me any privileges to use that system?  If the system in question has a
GUEST login or, perhaps, an anonymous FTP service, then I have been granted
a certain "privilege of use"; if not, I have neither the privilege nor the
right to attempt access to that system.  As I said, the existence of a
connective network is irrelevant; the same rules would apply to me if I
walked into the machine room at that remote site, wouldn't they?

[ Editor's comment: Ok so what good is having access if you don't have any
rights or privledges? Who decides what those rights or privledges are?
Are these rights or privledges stated anywhere? Who said Morris did not
have authorization to write a self-propagating program?]

>If it is our net, then we should be able to try some stuff
>on it, Яand to heck with 'them' if they can't take a joke.

When someone's "stuff" results in downtime, corrupted files, and trashed
systems, it is NOT a joke.  I know sysadmins who spent days recovering from
hacker "exploration" of their system.  If it's a commercial site (one which
charges for access), it may lose thousands of dollars in revenue during
recovery.  If it's an academic site, hundreds (or thousands) of users may
suffer; research grinds to a halt, academic assignments cannot be finished,
electronic mail stops in its tracks, and all users are displaced by hackers'
exploration.  Is this a "joke"?  Is your "exploration" and "learning" more
important than the work of hundreds, or thousands, of others?

[Editor's comment: Hey mistakes happen. That is part of life. If you can't
handle it then you should not be a sysadmin, and if you do decide to quit
your job let me know. I would love to be a sysadmin and get to work with big
computers.If its a commercial site my heart bleeds for them. If its an
academic site, then maybe everyone learned something from the experience.]

>    It is my contention that hackers did not change. Society changed, and it
>changed for the worse. The environment the early hackers were working in
>correctly viewed these activities as the desire to utilize technology in a
>personal way.

There is an important distinction between the "early hackers" and those of
today.  The early hackers did not operate on any system they could find;
their activities were restricted to local machines.  In a sense, this limita-
tion made them responsible for their activities.  RMS didn't go looking for
systems to "explore" at other universities.  Today, hackers rarely operate
on their own systems; most of them prefer to anonymously wander the networks,
looking for systems which they can use/misuse/abuse.  To me, that "crosses
the line" between "good" and "bad" hacking.  In addition, most of today's
hackers refuse to accept responsibility for their actions.  The Dutch hacker
conglomerate, for instance, believes that they can hack any system in the
world, since hacking is currently legal under Dutch law.  They saw no prob-
lem in hacking/cracking/crashing systems throughout Europe and the USA.  In
fact, one of them said in an interview, "In the real world, I would never
commit a crime."; this person has a badly skewed set of morals, in my opinion.

[ Editor's comment: I do not really see much of a distinction here. Why is it
okay to hack on a local machine that does not belong to you, but not a
networked machine that does not belong to you?
     I agree with you about the responsibility thing. I do think hackers
should be responsible for thier actions, even in cyberspace.]

>By definition hackers believe in the free access to computers
>and to the freedom of information.

This definition, sadly, is no longer correct.  Today's hackers believe
that computing should be free FOR THEMSELVES; they don't really care
about others.  RMS kept to his principles; the gnu.ai.mit.edu systems
provide access for almost anyone who asks.  Some other ex-hackers have
set up public access sites, such as Nyx; these are in keeping with the
hacker ethic of the past.

Today's hackers, on the other hand, don't want to expend any of their
own resources.  In a recent email conversation with a hacker, he claimed
that his lack of resources gave him the "right" (his word) to hack on
other systems through the networks.  That's ridiculous.

I've even been hacked from MIT, a site which has far greater compu-
ting resources than mine.  Why would someone at MIT *need* to hack my
systems, when so much is available to them there?  The only conclu-
sion I can reach is that those hackers do not want to accept respon-
sibility for their actions.  Are you arguing that I have some obli-
gation to condone/support/accept such irresponsibility?

[Editors comment: Perhaps many of today's hackers do not believe in the
hacker ethic of the past. I believe one of the main points of my editorial
was that we should reinforce the hacker ethic. Encourage them to contribute
and be responsible. Perhaps they could perform some sort of service for you
on your machine, in exchange for its use?
    Of course they did not *need* to hack your system. A hacker does not
*need* to do anything. There was probably something about your system
they liked. Consider it a compliment.]

>Current bad mouthing of hackers is simply snobbery.

Hardly; I know that my attitude toward today's hackers comes from my
obligation and responsibility to the owners of my systems, as well as
my obligation to the legitimate users.

[ Editors's comment: You are sounding an awful lot like a suit...]

We had a local hacking incident last year.  After tracking down the
responsible parties, I offered to give them full access to a small
Unix system (an AT&T 3B2/310), with only one condition; they would
be responsible for the actions taken with that system.  None of the
individuals involved wanted to assume responsibility, even though I
was willing to give them root access to a Unix system.

[ Editors comment: ? Got me. I would have taken it. Was it networked? Of
course networked machines are always more interesting.]

>Rather than cracking down on the modern hacker, we
>should reinforce the hacker ethic, a code of conduct not based upon greed and
>lust for the almighty dollar, but instead for personal growth through the free
>access of computers and information, and a respect for technology.

How about adding "respect for the property of others" to that statement?
If I purchased a Porsche, would you assume that you have the "right" to
open up the hood and start tinkering with the engine?  I don't think so.
Why should my purchase of, say, a Convex C240 be treated any differently?

[ Editor's comment: Hmm maybe you are right. Maybe they should not be
treated differently. Where do you park it? :) ]

In closing, let me address the question of resources.  Many hackers have
told me that "they don't have the money for a Unix system"; in fact, this
is often one of their cardinal arguments in defense of their actions.  A
Unix system for 286/386 microcomputers may be purchased for US$99.  I find
it very difficult to believe that these people cannot afford that small
amount of money.  Most of today's hackers would prefer to siphon their
needs from the monies and efforts spent by the owners/operators of other
systems.  They want someone else to fund their "exploration".

[ Editor's comment: The old 'Coherent is just as good as my mainframe'
argument. It is just not the same. Ok, I want to learn VMS. So how about
a $99 VMS clone for my PC?]

My systems are intended for use by a particular group of users; we cannot
fund the needs of the world.  No single site can afford to support everyone.
If I could afford to support such activities, I would set up a public access
system.  I can't afford that, so I expect others to respect my policies.

This entire discussion boils down to a single question, and no one has been
able to provide a suitable answer:
	
	Why should a site be expected to provide access to anyone
	other than those for whom it is purchased/maintained?

Best,
Wes Morgan

Introduction:
-------------

    Recently I began to wonder about the usefulness of 'virus scanners'
and what if any difference do they have with a simple text/hex search
program (like Nortons filefind/ts). And if there was no real DIFFERENCE,
how secure is the system that used them.

Problems with scanning:
-----------------------

    The first question I had to ask was, What does a 'virus scanner' actually
look for? Does it only look for one string of codes or several at different
places in the file?

    To answer this question I called a local BBS an dl'ed McAfee's
Scan3.7v64 (to evaluate and after my tests, it was erased for its lack of
offering any real protection). Then I went to my archives to retrieve some
viruses I have experimented with in the past (of which where Jerusalem B and
Dark Avenger).

    I ran scan to verify that the virus files where viruses (3 of which did
not set off any alarm even tho there was a listing in the documentation for
them, so I removed them from the test). Then using a sector editor looked at
the source for the McAfee asso. Scan3.7v64 (here after know just as Scan64)
to find that the footprint information was encoded. Needless to say this did
not stop me (for the sake of those who are into the tech aspects of things,
the actual method used to get the codes are included at the end of the
article with the codes found), It took less than an hour to get the codes I
was looking for (without disassembling the code but by looking into the
memory allocated to the program).

    What I found out was that Scan was just a simple hex searcher (that kept
its data locked up till needed). It could also be fooled by any program
that contained the same hex string as a real virus (this was proved when,
using a sector editor, I added the Scan64 footprint for the Jerusalem B
into the top of a text file (a place this code would never show up in a real
infection) then renamed it to *.com; Scan64 reported it as infected).

    Once the codes where obtained, using Debug directly on a virus file,
I was able to mutate the virus to no longer be detectable by Scan64 without
destroying the integrity of it. For the virus was still able to infect files,
and Scan64 could no longer track it. I was still able to track and control it
using Norton's filefind, diskmon, diskedit, and (of course) DOS erase.

    So it seems my question was answered. Some 'virus scanners' just scan
for a single string of hex character. This is fine if viruses NEVER changed
or programs would NEVER use code similar to what a virus would (the smaller
the footprint string the bigger the chance of mistaken alarms). For if
a 'virus scanner' programer just keeps making a new release each time there
is a new virus (an I will not get into the morality of charging customers
the full price of an software upgrade rather than allowing them to buy/dl
new footprint data files as they become available) for the program will
eventually grow to unwieldy sizes. An it should be noted there are other
programs that may do the same job faster, more upward compatibility, and
you may already have them on hand.

A possible solution:
--------------------

    One thing that I think is a good idea is when a program allows users
to add new footprint data to it (like Nortons' virus package). For now
users don't need to buy new releases for detection of viruses they may not
get/be able to detect. Instead for the cost of a call to a support bbs (part
of the original software agreement?) the user can get new data as it becomes
available or when they fine a new one on their system they can immediately
add the new footprint rather than wait for the next version to be released.

Method used to obtain footprints:
---------------------------------

    After finding the data I was looking for was encoded I thought, How can
I get the data I wanted for my tests?

    Disassembling was out, not for any MORAL reason but, for the time
involved. So I thought it must have to decode the data for it's own use
and to save time it would do it all before the scan rather than slow the
process down by doing a full decode. So I needed to look at the memory
image of the running program. Thanks to DOS 5.0 and Dosshell I was able to
do this.

    After spawning the scan task under the dos shell I used alt-tab to
swap back to the shell. Once back in the shell I used the shell commands to
copy the ~tmpxxx.swp to foo.img and terminating Scan64 and Dosshell.

    Then using a sector editor I searched though the temp file created by
the dos shell. I found an area of data that contained the virus names and
non ascii text data separating them. Even though the strings of ascii data
(virus names) ended with a zero character (as variable strings have a
tendency to), the random data did not end with a common signal character (as
expected for code can be any character). There was also no character count
stored (the data length varied so it could not be assumed by the scan
program as well). So I continued to search though the data.

    I eventually found another area that had the same text strings (virus
names). This time the first character of the none ascii data gave the count
of the data size to the following text string. I knew I had found it so I
extracted this data to another file (starting at 0 offset in the new file).
Then wrote down the some codes and checked them against viruses I had.

    The codes I had did not seem match. This did not stop me. I took one
virus (that my understanding said scan was only looking for 6 consecutive
bytes to match) and started zapping bytes (in a file scan said was infected)
to find what it was looking for. The processes involved zapping one sector
at a time till scan said it was not infected, then half of that sector, then
half of a half, and so on. It came down to 6 CONSECUTIVE bytes as I expected.
But they where DIFFERENT from the ones I had.

    So I went to the windows calculator (it allows byte arithmetic in hex,
ie.. 0xff + 0x04 = 0x03 (rollover, carry is ignored), it would be outside
the scope of this ARTICLE to explain why I thought byte arithmetic was
important). Some quick subtraction found a 0x93 (decimal 147) DIFFERENCE
between the actual codes and the ones from the allocated memory uses by
scan.

    So taking another virus that scan said was infected I did the minor
hex math on the codes in the allocated memory used by scan and found the
codes. Then i zapped only the codes and ran scan on the updated virus file.
It said there was no infection. I knew I now had the right codes (after a few
more checks).

    So I created a simple C program (see below) to convert the extract file I
 created and converted the codes to a readable form (output from program
listed at end of ARTICLE). Then tested other viruses against the list. An
found the same results.

    Hello kiddies, An what a dreary day in the neighborhood... [Oops
sorry wrong show]..... Well any way welcome to Hackers street... We
are your good friends The BBC... Today we thought.... Why look there
is Big Hackbird, an he looks depressed, lets find out why...

    Hackbird Why so down... 'Well BBC it seems that all the
users\sysop stoped using ANSI [AAAAHHHHHHHH] on their systems'...
'Now I can't make problem messages'... 'What is a Hackbird to do'...
Never fear, Hackbird, The BBC is here... Have we ever let you down
before??? 'Well yes, there was that time you dropped me and a short
sysop from the world trade center to prove that all objects fall at
the same rate on last weeks show and...' [Smack] Well anyway...

    So today then we will learn [Thanks to the new feature of some
boards that let users [and hackers] upload messages using protocols
other than ascii]... Yes now you can imbed into messages special
chars. that can not be typed in, in some cases... Three of which
are... ^G, ^S, and the null char. [0x00]... An what nasty little
things they could be used for... Not that We would even suggest
such things...

    First we will talk about ^G [0x07] better know as the bell
char.... 'Me, know about bell. Noisy, don't like'... 'But it bother
ears to put in and some boards don't take'... 'An what is few beep
anyway'...That is true Crashy monster... But, Remember there are now
boards that let us upload large messages... An we are no longer
talking a few beeps but instead a few thousand beeps... For till a
paused is reached [80 * 24 or 1920 chars. in some cases] a person
must listen to our lil' musical... Crash in 'c' minor... 'Yes, me
see... Me like, me like'... Well if you liked that you will love
what comes next... But first would like to help us test something...
'Ya, Ya what... New Virus, Trojan, Password cracker'... No just this
new trap door and spiked pit... 'What spiked... AHHHHHHHHhhhhhh
[Splat]'...

    'Yes, this is Kermit t. Protocol reporting from BBC labs'...
Today they are hard at work with their new toy ^S [0x13]...
'Professor BBC tell us about this ^S'... Well lil' green buddy it is
the infamous Xoff char.... It is used to signal the remote not to
send anymore chars. till a ^Q [0x11 (Xon)] is received... What this
will do is make the caller think his keyboard is locked for what he
types is not sent... Ohhhh if they have any brains they will hit
the ^Q manually but don't expect much... An to put a few of these
in a message will cause a bit of a problem... An the quote features
will carry them forward as well.. 'That is nice, what else is BBC
labs working on'... We are glad you asked... We have branched out
into the realm of comedy... Like over here is out latest joke... How
would you like to be part of this great experiment kermy... 'Well I
guess... what the blender for?'... Ok, Ready... What is green and
red n' goes 120 MPH... 'I don't know... Hey! What are you doing...'
.. Kermit t. Protocol in a blender... [BUZZZZZZZZZZZ]
'Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

    Finally kiddies, Grover the pirate will help us with... 'Yes! I
Grover the pirate will help the BBC with their talk about...'
Groovy... Now, you want to be in next weeks show, right... 'Well
yes.. but why wouldn't I'... Well you could meet with a nasty
mishap... 'What kind of mishap?'... Well like someone could hit this
rope with a knife [Snap]... 'So'... Well that rope supported a 16
ton weight over your head... 'What 16 to....[Splat]'... Now kids we
hope you learned from this, an remember never play with knives near
ropes attached to 16 ton weights... Well now that we will not be
bothered... The Null char. [0x00] is a funny little thing in that
some BBS software will not send it in ansii mode... So you ask what
good is a char. like that... Well there may come the time you need a
timer... a way to make the host wait a few seconds after sending a
group of chars. like an Attention signal [in most cases '+++']...
For to get a message to the host modem you must sent an attention
signal then wait about 3 seconds before sending the hangup command
[ATH0] to have the users session bail out in mid message... Of
course you will have to send about 5 pages worth [no line returns]
of this char. to get the right delay... But thank to the non ascii
upload method this will be easy... An we would hope you will not use
this to send an hangup followed by a call command to a 900 number...
That would be most evil... An you may grow up to be scum like...

******************************************************************
**      WAY TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL ON TELEGARD BBS!        **
******************************************************************

Well a friend of yours or maybe a enemy, well who ever this person
is, is a regular caller of the BBS type Telegard v2.7.  You out of
normal curious nature, would like to know what he is writing about
to the other babes on the system.  Well a couple of ways can be
used, some legal some not:

A) Break into the sysop's house when he/she is at work, or on
     vacation and just reading, hoping the neighbors didn't hear
     you use TNT to break down the door.  This method can be
     somewhat dangerous, but still possible.

B) Find out the working schedule of the sysop and when he/she is
     not home, spend it trying to hack out the privileged accounts.
     This could get kind of boring or tiring after a while.  Also,
     if you are a *real* hacker, you live on pizza and chips.  Well
     the chip company and local pizza joint will be getting a lot
     of your drug money.

C) Use the method I am going to tell you.  Can be a little tedious,
     if you want to read a lot of mail from different users.

D) And any other scummy forms of hacking.

Well, I feel the most logical one is 'C'.  Well to get down to how
to do it, first you must find out the full alias used by the
victim.  For example:  Let me pick a name randomly out of my head,
well how about 'TWO FACE'.   Hey, no booing allowed!!!   What I
mean by FULL ALIAS, is don't try it will TWO or 2FACE, basically
use that thing between your ears.  With this name, you would try
to log on as 'TWO FACE2' or 'TWO FACE1'.  The object is to make
sure a character follows the real name.  It will allow you to log
on, after the logon, go to the message section and start reading.

The reason this works is because, simple:  In the message section
the computer looks at the first message FROM:Peter Pan TO:Killer
Bee.  Your name, TWO FACE2, doesn't start with a P or a K so it
skips that message.  The next message it looks at, FROM:Amy Lowell
TO:TWO FACE.  The 'T''W''O'' ''F''A''C''E'' is all equal.  It
allows you to read it.  It doesn't check to see that you have a
extra character.

Well enjoy, this small but useful hack.  I will be reporting if
this works on other BBS systems.  Maybe, PCBoard has a small error
like this.  (c)1992 Hard Rock


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * NOTE * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
I am NOT in any way responsible for you getting you ass screwed
because you attempt to mess around with some local subscription
system.  Don't say to the sysop or cops, well it was HARD ROCK,
yeah that dude who wrote the document.  LAST TIME: THIS IS FOR
INFORMATION USE ONLY!!!
