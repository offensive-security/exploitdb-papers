       COMPUTER COLUMNIST AND OPEN-GOVERNMENT ACTIVIST JIM WARREN
          TO RECEIVE 1994 HUGH M. HEFNER FIRST AMENDMENT AWARD

Computer columnist and open-government activist Jim Warren has been
selected to receive the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in the
category of Government, the Playboy Foundation announced today.

Warren is honored for being one of the leaders in effectively using
online advocacy and network-assisted citizen action.  Warren
organized and led a successful grass roots campaign to implement a
plan for a low-cost computerized public information system,
bringing access to state government records to citizens throughout
California.

In March, 1993, California Assemblywoman Debra Bowen introduced a
bill that required that virtually all of the state's public
legislative information be made available to the public by computer
modem.  Intrigued by the bill, Warren called Bowen and was told
that the bill was virtually dead because it would cost millions
of dollars to implement and there was very little public support.

Convinced that there was an almost free way of implementing it
using the Internet, the largest, nonprofit, nonproprietary,
cooperative public computer network in the world, Warren
single-handedly launched a crusade to ensure the bill's passage.
Warren went online broadcasting the details of the bill and issued
calls for citizen support and action alerts.  The result of his
grass roots electronic campaign was immediate and impressive.  What
had been a "dead" bill passed four committee votes and three floor
votes without a single opposing vote.

In October 1993, California Governor Pete Wilson signed the bill
into law, making California the first state in the nation to
provide online access via the Internet to extensive details of all
state legislation in progress.  Warren's efforts to open up state
government marks the first time online advocacy and network
assisted citizen action was instrumental in the passage of state
legislation.

A leading figure in computer-assisted public access, Warren founded
the online newsletter, GovAccess, through which he has campaigned
vigorously and effectively to open government to public view.  He
has long used his columns in MicroTimes, Government Technology and
BoardWatch magazines to rally support for overdue reforms in
government information procedures, and was the 1991 founder and
chair of the First Conference on Computers, Freedom & Privacy.

He is now campaigning to make similarly accessible, records such as
the economic interest statements of state officials, lobbyists'
disclosure forms, campaign finance reports and state information
that is already computerized and to which the public has a
theoretical right of access under the California Public Records
Act.  He is also encouraging local communities to develop civic
networks, providing 24-hour online access to city and county
government.

Along with Warren, other 1994 Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award
winners include: media critics Jeff Cohen and Normon Solomon, for
co-writing Adventures in Medialand: Behind the News, Beyond the
Pundits, a collection of collection of commentaries on media
issues; attorney Anthony Griffin, for his moral courage in
defending the right of the Klu Klux Klan to keep its membership
lists private; The Oregonian editorial page editor Robert Landauer,
for producing a series of editorials aimed at overturning Measure
9, the anti-gay constitutional amendment in Oregon; drama teacher
Carole Marlowe, for staging a dramatic reading of the play the
play, The Shadowbox that provided a far greater opportunity for the
community to discuss censorship, the First Amendment and artistic
freedom; and First Amendment Congress founder Jean Otto, for
developing the Education for Freedom curriculum for teaching the
First Amendment in public schools.

These winners, who will be honored at an awards luncheon ceremony
on November 16, 1994 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City,
were selected by an independent panel of judges, including Carl
Jensen, professor of communication studies at Sonoma State
University, founding director of Project Censored and a 1992
recipient of a Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award; Jessica
Mitford, social change activist and author of The American Way of
Death; and Rex Armstrong, attorney, volunteer counsel to the
American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon and 1988 Hugh M. Hefner
First Amendment Award winner.

Established in 1979 by the Playboy Foundation, the Hugh M. Hefner
First Amendment Awards program honors individuals who have made
significant contributions to defend First Amendment rights for
Americans.  Eligibility is not restricted by profession, but
nominees traditionally have come from the areas of print and
broadcast journalism, education, publishing, law, government and
arts and entertainment.

I'm told that the New York Legislature's lower house now has an Internet
server, and that their Senate will have one shortly.  No word yet as to
whether either is yet operational, nor if the world can reach 'em.  But
it's alleged that they are taking Inet access very seriously and hot in
pursuit of comin' online.  For more information, contact yer legis-creature.

I DON'T KNOW OF ANY DEBATE SCHEDULES ... DO YOU?

>From bhami@ix.netcom.com Thu Oct 13 23:01:51 1994

A constant annoyance every election season is the inability to find
schedules of campaign debates, short of spending an hour a day scanning
newspapers (time I don't have).  Do you know of any BBS's, Web sites,
gophers, listservs, etc., that might have such information?

I missed the Feinstein/Huffington "debate" on Larry King Live. :-(

MINNESOTA E-DEMOCRACY 1994 - CAMPAIGN AND ELECTION INFORMATION
From: "Steven L. Clift" <clif0005@gold.tc.umn.edu> Sun Oct 16 15:26:20 1994

[An outstanding model of some of the possibilities.  What are you or others
doing in *your* state?  --jim]

The Minnesota E-Democracy project invites you to explore our updated campaign
and election information server on the Internet and to join our interactive
election and public policy electronic mail forum.  This citizen organized
project has combined the an interactive forum with retrievable election
information.  This combination has been key to its success. It has built a
foundation electronic citizen participation and discussion of important issues.

The new Twin Cities Free-Net is the host of the Internet server and the
Minnesota Regional Network (MRNet) has donated the e-list facilities.

The project has collected position papers from candidates for Governor and
U.S. Senate, the voter registration and constitutional amendment information
from the Secretary of State, candidate profiles from the Star-Tribune
newspaper, and many other election oriented documents in electronic form.
In near future we will be adding the text of the voter guide produced by the
Minnesota League of Women's Voters.

This on-line effort was launched only a few weeks before the September primary
election and is one of only a handful multi-candidate, state-level projects of
it kind. The E-Democracy Internet server is filled with content and the
Minnesota Politics and Public Policy E-mail Forum (MN-POLITICS) has around 300
subscribers - close to three times more than any other state-based public
affairs electronic mail list.  The forum is also archived on the server, so
you need not subscribe to the list to follow the interesting debate.

Project volunteers are now working to hold the first e-mail debate between
candidates for the U.S. Senate and Governor in Minnesota.  If it can be pulled
off, it will probably be the first on-line e-debate between campaigns at that
level. At a minimum side-by-side issue papers will be presented on a some key
topics over the course of a few days for each race.

If the information below does not answer your questions about reaching the
server, subscribing to the e-mail forum, or about the effort in general,
please feel free to contact us at our e-mail address. The volunteers working
on the debate are looking for question suggestions for the e-debate, so send
them in!

We look forward to your participation.

Information Infrastructure ... but not for little folks or "radical" views?
DUNIFER SAYS FCC SEEKS INJUNCTION TO GAG MICRO-POWER BROADCASTER

From: mech@eff.org Sun Oct 16 05:18:20 1994
From: Stephen Dunifer <frbspd@crl.com>
To: action@eff.org (action mailing list)

On Tuesday, October 10 attorneys for Stephen Dunifer and Free
Radio Berkeley received notice, 80 pages worth, of the FCC's intention to
seek an injunction which would bar further broadcasts by Free Radio
Berkeley.  Stephen Dunifer is named as the responsible party.  Free Radio
Berkeley is part of a rapidly growing movement which uses inexpensive and
low power radio transmitters (1/2 watt to 30 watts) to reach local
communities. Called micro power broadcasting, this movement sees simple,
easy to use transmitters as the leaflet of the 90's.  In an era of
multinational controlled mass media, micro power broadcasting is the voice
of the community; the voice of the people.  For four years the government
has been trying to squelch this movement with escalating (but uncollected)
fines.  Clearly, it sees broadcasting which anyone can do as a threat to
centralized control of information, ideas and culture.  Intimidation
having failed, the FCC is abandoning its own procedures and turning to the
weight of the Federal Courts to squelch this new and democratic media.  It
won't happen.

Last July the FCC served a notice of apparent liability on Stephen
Dunifer in the amount of $20,000 for alleged illegal broadcasts.  This
case has been pending before an FCC administrative panel for over a year.
In July 1994, a Federal Appeals Court in the District of Columbia ruled
that the FCC's current fine structure was invalid.  This action, at the
very least, places the FCC fine process into a state of limbo until new
hearings are held.  Perhaps this explains why the FCC has taken this mode
of attack.

Luke Hiken, attorney for Stephen Dunifer, stated, "This is a
totally unprecedented move on the part of the FCC.  It appears they have
side-stepped their own authority regarding micro radio broadcasting.
Instead, they have chosen to bring down the full weight of the Federal
Court System on an ever expanding community of broadcasters who are
challenging the FCC's ban on micro power broadcasting.". (continued)

"They can kiss my Bill of Rights" was Stephen Dunifer's response,
who went on further to say, "Neither myself nor the movement to liberate
and reclaim the airwaves from corporate control will be deterred one bit
by the FCC's latest action.  It is a matter of free speech and human
rights.  No where in their prodigious legal tome does any aggrieved party
come forth, other than the FCC, to assert damage or harm.  FCC, in my
opinion, stands for fostering corporate control.  Free Radio Berkeley has
been on vacation for the last few months in order to allow time to put
together new equipment.  Broadcasts will resume shortly at a new
frequency, 104.1 FM, and continue until the date of the first court
hearing.  If an injunction is granted, there are many others taking up the
banner of Free Radio Berkeley.  We shall not be moved nor stymied by a
justice system which means, in reality, just us corporations."

Another member of the legal defense team, Allen Hopper, put it
this way, "It is utterly amazing that the FCC would seek a TRO, which is
only sought for emergency situations where the threat of immediate and
irreparable harm requires the intervention of the Court.  The fact that
the FCC has had this case pending before its own administrative panel for
over a year contradicts any notion of emergency or injury.  Further, their
actions clearly demonstrate the fear they hold for the kind of public
dialogue which takes place over micro power radio."

Luke Hiken and the National Lawyers Guild Committee on Democratic
Communications are committed to defending the rights of micro broadcasters
under the US Constitution and principles of international law.

At this moment, a hearing on this matter is scheduled to take
place on December 2 in Federal District Court in Oakland starting at 10:30
AM.  A Free Speech Solidarity Support Rally will be held outside the
Oakland Federal Building prior to the hearing.  On the following evening
(Saturday, December 3) a public forum flying the banner of - Seizing the
Space, Media and Communications Free Speech Activism - will be held in
Berkeley at the Unitarian Fellowship (Cedar & Bonita).  Starting time will
be 8 PM.  Simultaneous forums on this topic will be taking place in a
number of other cities around the US, and perhaps internationally as well,
on this date.

INTERNET?  INTERNET WHO?

I just got around to reading "What is the Internet, Anyway?" by John Quarterman
(author of THE MATRIX from Digital Press) and Smoot Carl-Mitchell,
in the September issue of MicroTimes (a California print monthly;
microx@well.com) and was *delighted* with it.  It provides a MUCH-needed
reasonable delineation of the words and concepts for the ambiguities involved
when folks refer to "the net" or the "Internet" -- a useful structure of the
concepts and labels.

John has advised me that a longer version is now available over the net, as:

COURT INFORMATION ONLINE
[The Sacramento Bar Association Journal carried an article a year or so ago,
urging that the press pay as much attention to the judicial branch of
government as they pay to the executive and legislative branches - proposing
that it needs the same level of vigilent public oversight as do the better-
known branches.  What a provocative thought.  I asked some questions about
online access to court records.  --jim]

I can answer at least some of your questions.  "EDOS" stands for
Electronic Dissemination of Opinion System, an effort by the
federal intermediate appellate courts to provide electronic
copies of their respective courts' opinions via their own BBSes.
As far as I know, these systems now are free.  The Tenth Circuit
EDOS (for the court hearing appeals from federal trial courts in
Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, Kansas and Oklahoma)
includes copies of its opinions less than 90 days old.

"PACER" stands for Public Access to Court Electronic, or
something like that.  It's the system used by the bankruptcy
courts and many if not all federal district courts to provide
information about the status of cases.  This is a fee-based
system.

The Federal Circuit's EDOS numbers are 202-786-6504 and 202-633-9608.

**international issues of security and privacy and  computer law

**international issues of computer development (keyboards, safety)

**issues of design

**language

And whatever other global issues you want to discuss.  Right now
the list will be predominately in English, because it's the lingua

CPSR, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
 is based at a home office in Palo Alto, California, and has
22 chapters.  You can learn more about CPSR at
http://www.cpsr.org/dox/home.html or by writing to
listserv@cpsr.org with the email message HELP.  CPSR began
as a response to the Star Wars program, when members
wrote reports and testified at hearings about the impossibility
of providing a "fail-safe" network of nuclear missles in outer
space.  Today CPSR is interested in all social issues related to the
use of computers, from repetitive stress syndrome from keyboard use, to
the intrusion into privacy by government and business, and others.
CPSR is a highly respected group, whose members are well informed.

The 1,800 members of CPSR have an awareness about the potential
benefits of computers to our society, such as their ability to
personalize the interface from an otherwise large impersonal society
to the individual, but the also understand the large potential
risk inherent in the use of computers and computer technology by
individuals, governments, and corporations. CPSR asks questions such
as, "Will there be equal access to the Information Superhighway"
(also called the "Infobahn" or NII)?  What can we do to lessen the gap
between those who are "information-rich" and those who are
"information-poor?"

BROKEN ELM BRANCHES

Recently your GovAccess posts have been confusing my mailreader (Elm).
When you 'repost' a message in the list sometimes you leave the header
in its original form.  The "From xxx@xxx" looks like a real message to
my reader.  The other 2 forms ">From xxx@xxx" and "From: xxx@xxx" are ok.

==to which I replied==
Thanks for the heads-up about ELM confusion.  Will *try* to remember to
modify the msg source-lines, but won't guarantee it.  Large task; small mind.

Comic Relief
AWARDS TO CELEBRATE BEST USES OF "INFORMATION HIGHWAY"
>From les@SAIL.Stanford.EDU Fri Oct 14 16:15:46 1994

   [.  .  .]
   We're looking for the success stories and examples of electronic
   commerce, community and health networks, virtual libraries, distance
   learning, online information services, collaborative work and more.  It
   doesn't matter whether you're using the Internet or ATM.

I wonder if they would consider an award for the first commercial use
of the network, which I believe was a drug deal betweeen grad students
at Stanford and MIT circa 1970.
