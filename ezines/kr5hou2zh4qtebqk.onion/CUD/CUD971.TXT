The Silicon Bomb
by George Smith  September 25, 1997

Which would you rather have export controls on, technology used
for encryption or technology used in the development of nuclear
weaponry? The answer is obvious to most people. Everyone, that is, but
the U.S. government.

Here's the conundrum: The mandarins of law enforcement say that
encryption must be controlled, because homegrown terrorists and thugs
can use it to make their communications and records invulnerable. But
machines employed in the engineering of modern thermonuclear bombs can
be sold to Russian scientists in the former Soviet Union's most famous
nuclear weapons shop.

It's true, and the story goes like this.

More than a year ago, Gary Milhollin, the director of the
Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, D.C.,
discovered that Silicon Graphics had sold four supercomputers to
Russian scientists at the nuclear weapons lab known as Chelyabinsk-70.
Nothing happened for a couple of months until Milhollin issued a
widely published editorial in late February of this year.

In it, Milhollin wrote, "[the Russians] got the computers just in
time to continue the arms race. Russia's minister of atomic energy,
Viktor Mikhailov, told the press recently that Moscow... will now
design its warheads with simulated explosions, using the computers
from Silicon Graphics."

Around the same time the Department of Commerce, along with the
Department of Justice, began a criminal investigation of the case.
According to export controls, technology capable of being used in the
manufacture of nuclear weapons is not to be sold to nuclear weapons
labs in Russia, Pakistan and China. That part of the equation is a
no-brainer.

However, Milhollin wrote that Silicon Graphic's CEO, Edward
McCracken, told him the company didn't know what Chelyabinsk did. John
Thompson, head of corporate communications at the Mountain View
company, said in interview that officials at Chelyabinsk-70 said they
wanted the computers for "environmental research."

"That's their story," said Milhollin in an interview. "It's like
someone saying they don't know what Los Alamos does."

You see, control of the transfer of technology useful in the
of nuclear weapons has become infinitely more complicated since
the height of the Cold War. In the case of computers, as they've
advanced rapidly in processing power, the industry has lobbied
aggressively for revision of export controls, saying that such
controls do little except hurt American business. The argument is that
since processing power is always increasing, sooner or later clients
like the Russians will be able to buy it from anyone, so controls do
little good.

"...The quantum advancement of technology and its widespread
foreign availability have made export controls on desk-top and
desk-side computer systems obsolete and ineffective," said one
industry press release on the matter in 1995. "[Relaxing export
controls] frees up sales of a wide variety of computers without
shackling... customers with onerous security conditions...."

This is similar to the arguments fielded by concerned Netizens
against control of encryption, with one small exception: The first U.S
hydrogen bomb blew a crater one mile wide in the Pacific atoll of
Eniwetok.

The four machines, for which Silicon Graphics was paid
$200,000, aren't really supercomputers, argued Thompson. At Silicon
Graphics, he said, they're thought of as "desktop servers," capable of
2.9 billion operations per second -- 150 times less powerful than
supercomputers made by Cray Research. Conversely, a 486 PC -- what
this article is being written on -- is capable of approximately 12.5
million operations per second. Compared to it, the SGI machines in
question are, relatively speaking, Crays.

But this argument falls on deaf ears today. Because, in response
to pressure from the computer industry, the Clinton administration
abolished the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls
in 1994. This informal forum associated with NATO helped coordinate
policy and review potential exports to the former Soviet Union and
other proscribed destinations. And in 1995 the administration issued a
new, more relaxed set of controls on computing power.

The new controls divided world nations into four categories, of
which only two are interesting: Category D -- which includes Iraq,
Iran and North Korea, nations that are completely embargoed; and
Category C -- the next lowest tier, which includes Russia. In tier C
no government review is required for sale of computers capable of
between two and seven billion operations per second to civilians. An
export license -- a review -- is required for potential sales to
military sites. The SGI computers are rated at 2.9 billion operations
per second.

Thus, since Silicon Graphics insisted it was unaware of
Chelyabinsk-70's true nature, there was no need to review the sale.
Note that the processing power threshold for government review prior
the Clinton administration's revision was 1.5 billion operations
per second, which would have probably nixed the SGI sale.

Of course, Thompson claims that although Silicon Graphics is
cooperating fully with the criminal investigation, there is still some
question about whether or not the company's machines were capable of
being used in the testing and design of thermonuclear weapons.

Perhaps, but it's an argument that ignores history. Theoretical
physicists working on the hydrogen bomb in 1949 yearned for computing
power greater than the ENIAC, a machine horribly antiquated by today's
standards. The scientists had difficulty making any progress since the
main obstacle standing in the way of the hydrogen bomb's development
was an elaborate calculation dealing with the thermonuclear reaction.
Without the calculation, the scientists thought testing would be
extremely difficult because no one would be able to determine if a
bomb failed because the thermonuclear reaction wasn't feasible or
because a simple mechanical malfunction had occurred.

Because of the SGI case, two congressmen -- Rep. Floyd Spence
(R-S.C.) and Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Calif.) recently compiled a report
asking for yet another revision in supercomputer export controls.

Subject: File 2--Freelancers Lose Copyright Claim for Works Put On E-databases

Publishers may put their periodicals on electronic databases without the
permission of freelance writers who provide work for their print
publications, according to a  recent decision by the Southern District of
New York.  The case was brought by six freelance writers who claimed
copyright violations because their articles had been sold by newspapers or
magazines after publication and uploaded onto CD-ROMs or electronic databases.

The writers claimed that there was no written agreement spelling out their
rights for articles that they had written for print versions of the
publications including the New York Times, Sports Illustrated and Newsday,
thereby giving the publishers a windfall when they resold or made the works
available to on-line publications.

The court stated that there is no real precedent governing electronic
technologies and the application of Section 201(c) of the Copyright Act of
1976, which permits reproduction of ''collective works,'' and held that
putting the stories on-line was not an inappropriate exploitation of the
freelancers' works.

While the court recognized that the ruling "deprives plaintiffs of certain
benefits associated with their creations,'' it called on Congress to revise
copyright laws to provide a more equitable result.

SAFE crypto bill cracked again
By Alex Lash and Dan Goodin
September 12, 1997, 8:40 a.m. PT

For the second time in a week, a House committee has made significant
changes to the Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE) Act to
mandate that domestic encryption products give law enforcement agencies
access to users' messages.

The changes by the Intelligence Committee, which were passed as a
"substitute" to SAFE, turn the legislation on its head. The amendment
follows similar changes two days ago in the House National Security
Committee.

Initially drafted as a way to loosen U.S. export controls on encryption,
legislators have instead "marked up" the bill, or amended it at the
committee level, to reflect the wishes of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other law enforcement agencies that want "wiretap"
access to all encrypted email and other digital files.

Both the Intelligence and the National Security committees tend to favor
export controls, because they view encryption as a threat to
information-gathering activities by U.S. military and law enforcement
officials.

The Intelligence Committee cited those concerns today when announcing
the substitute legislation. "Terrorist groups...drug cartels...and those
who proliferate in deadly chemical and biological weapons are all
formidable opponents of peace and security in the global society," said
committee chairman Porter Goss (R-Florida) in a statement. "These bad
actors must know that the U.S. law enforcement and national security
agencies, working under proper oversight, will have the tools to
frustrate illegal and deadly activity and bring international criminals
to justice."

Opponents of government attempts to regulate encryption, including a
leading panel of cryptographers, have argued that built-in access to
encrypted files would in fact threaten national and individual security
and be prohibitively expensive to implement.

The amended legislation calls for all imported or U.S.-made encryption
products that are manufactured or distributed after January 31, 2000, to
provide "immediate access" to the decrypted text if the law officials
present a court order. "Law enforcement will specifically be required to
obtain a separate court order to have the data, including
communications, decrypted."

A markup of the same bill in the House Commerce Committee was postponed
today for two weeks. It will be the fifth such committee vote on the
bill since its introduction.

The Intelligence and National Security amendments this week are by no
means a defeat of the bill. Instead, they would have to be reconciled
with versions of the bill already approved by the House Judiciary and
International Relations committees. That reconciliation most likely
would have to happen on the House floor. The rapidly fragmenting bill
still has several layers of procedure to wend through before it reaches
a potential floor vote, but people on both sides of the encryption
debate openly question if the bill--in any form--will make it that far
this year.

The legislation has 252 cosponsors, more than half of the House
membership.

I have just finished reading CU-Digest #9.70.  I thought I would pass
along to you (and the other CUD readers if you think it appropriate)
a pointer to a *very* interesting legal research paper (by Michael W.
Carroll of the Georgetown University Law Center) regarding the
regulation
of UCE.

Check out http://server.Berkeley.EDU/BTLJ/articles/11-2/carroll.html

It describes the legal theories behind the regulation of other sorts
of unsolicited commercial communications (junk fax, telephone
solicitation, door-to-door sales and junk mail) and examines their
applicability to regulation of junk e-mail.

I haven't the legal backgroud to attest to the *quality* of that
analysis, but it does make for interesting reading.

Subject: File 6--Texas Judge Enjoins "Spamming"

Source -  fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

**************************************************
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


TEXAS JUDGE ENJOINS "SPAMMING" OF INTERNET
BY CALIFORNIA STUDENT AND COMPANY

Austin, Texas, September 22, 1997:  A Texas Court has entered a temporary
injunction  against a California college student and his company,
prohibiting further "spamming" of the Internet without consent.  Several
Internet leaders in Austin filed the lawsuit earlier this year, claiming
that Craig Nowak and his company, C.N. Enterprises, had illegally used the
return address of an Austin business when he sent out a mass commercial
solicitation by Internet electronic mail.

The lawsuit was filed by Tracy LaQuey Parker, a leading Internet author,
who owned the rights to the domain named "flowers.com" which Nowak and
his company used without her permission.  Mr. Nowak's unsolicited mass
mailing, known as a "spam," offered for sale information on "Free Cash Gran=
ts"
for $19.95.  Mr. Nowak's "spam" used Ms. Parker's domain name in the
electronic
return address, which allowed Mr. Nowak to avoid receiving thousands of
return-to-sender messages and the inevitable hate mail from recipients who
despise the controversial practice of "spamming."  Ms. Parker received
thousands of such return messages, preventing her from accessing her
Internet account for hours and temporarily shutting down her Internet
service provider's mail servers.  In essence, the lawsuit claims, Mr. Nowak
used Ms. Parker's mailbox as his personal trash bin.

Spamming is being criticized at all levels of the industry.  Upon hearing
of the lawsuit, Vint Cerf, Senior Vice President for MCI
Telecommunications, also known as "the father of the Internet," said,
"Spamming is the scourge of electronic mail and newsgroups on the Internet.
It can seriously interfere with the operation of public services, to say
nothing of the effect it may have on any individual=EDs mail system.
Spammers are, in effect, taking resources away from users and service
suppliers without compensation and without authorization.  MCI was the
first in the industry to publicly announce its policy against spamming and
will be watching the decision in this case with great interest."

The court order, entered last Wednesday, September 17, by Travis County
District Judge Scott McCown, prohibits Nowak, his company, and those
"acting in concert" with him, from using Ms. Parker's domain name in any
electronic mailings, or from using any Internet domain name as a return
address without the owner's permission.  Judge McCown also ordered Mr.
Nowak to respond to discovery requests served upon him and set the case for
trial on November 10, 1997.

Joining Ms. Parker in the lawsuit are her business partners, Peter Rauch,
and her husband, Patrick Parker, who also used the domain name.  Also suing
Nowak is Ms. Parker's Internet service provider at the time, Zilker
Internet Park, which had to deal with the consequences of the flood of
returned junk mail messages.  They are joined by two Internet interest
groups, the Texas Internet Service Providers' Association and EFF-Austin.
Both groups fear the damage done to the Internet by mass mailings of the
sort at issue in this lawsuit.

Ms. Parker said she was pleased with the court's ruling.  "Judge McCown
seemed to quickly understand the harm that this type of irresponsible use
of the Internet can cause people like me and small businesses like Zilker,"
she said.  "We hope that this ruling sends a message not only to the
defendants, but to everyone who is abusing the Internet in this way."  Pete
Kennedy, the lawyer who is representing Ms. Parker and the others,
commented that, "While Internet service providers are trying to combat
"spam" with technical means, there is also a need to set a clear legal
precedent that people do not have the right to send Internet junk mail and
use other people's e-mail accounts as their personal junkyard."

...not having much in the way of sleep since reading Louis Freeh's

something about it, and try to develop something that would help
others get involved too...

I would like to announce the availability of a Personal Political

House and the Senate and may be used for mail merging, faxing, email
campaigns, as well as plain old phone calls.  The data were culled
from the House and Senate directories that are on the Web, and are
current as of September 3, 1997.

The datasets are provided in two formats, tab-delimited and as an
Excel spreadsheet.  Two sample letters are included that show how to
use the mail-merge features of Office95/97, along with a README file
that will step users through the basics of using this kit and offers
some hints on what to say -- and sometimes more importantly NOT to say
-- in a letter to their congress-folk.

The kit can be accessed at:  http://www.zeitgeist.com/crypto

I plan on updating this toolkit with more features soon with some more
tools, and the ability to send mail/faxes to entire committees (as
opposed to picking congress persons/senators by individually), some
Java Applets to auto-generate letters, etc.

Subject: File 8--Anti-Terrorist Squad Orders Political Censorship Of The

The following press release was issued this morning by the
Campaign for Internet Freedom

Press release: immediate 18 September 1997

Anti-Terrorist Squad Orders Political Censorship Of The Internet

In the first move of its kind in the UK, Scotland Yard's
Anti-Terrorist Squad yesterday shut down Internet Freedom's UK web
site. Claiming to be acting against terrorism, the Squad demanded
that Easynet PLC, Internet Freedom's UK Internet Service Provider,
remove the entire content of the site from the web.

Internet Freedom is one of the foremost anti-censorship campaigns
in the UK. The web site featured the latest Net censorship news,
links to other anti-censorship campaigns, carefully researched
articles about censorship and a regular controversy feature. The
section of the site that was alleged to contain 'terrorist
material' related to a feature on the Euskal Herria Journal - a
New York based political publication. The online magazine supports
Basque independence and contains maps of the region, cartoons and
an online petition to the Spanish government.

The Journal had been originally suspended by its US Internet
Service Provider following an extended email campaign which
brought the host server to a standstill. In opposition to its
censorship, Internet Freedom, along with a number of other
organisations and individuals, hosted a copy of the suspended site
or 'mirror site', together with a bulletin board for Net users to
express their views.

As a consequence of the Squad's actions, Internet Freedom has been
forced to move its news operations to its US site at
<http://www.netfreedom.org> where anybody with access to the web
may examine the site and judge the content for themselves.

Chris Ellison, co-founder of CIF said:

Those who argue in favour of censorship on the Net claim that it
is to prevent the spread of pornography or paedophilia.
Yesterday's act of blatant political censorship shows the
consequences of accepting the need for regulations and controls.
Whatever one might think about the Euskal Herria Journal and its
entirely ordinary content, it is important that they be allowed
put their views across.

We are calling on the whole of the Net community to support us by
mirroring Internet Freedom's site. Internet Freedom has always
prided itself on exposing acts of censorship that have been
dressed in some other garb. Now we have been met with the most
blatant act of political censorship imaginable: the shutting down
of our site. If there was ever a time for Net users to defend free
speech, that time is now.

           DEEP-FRIED ATTITUDE FOR A WORLD STARVED FOR SUPERHEROES

CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) regrets the delay in releasing our glorious Global
Domination Update. What with George Clooney hopping onto Princess Diana's
coffin to settle old scores with the tabloids, it's been hell trying to get a
word in edgewise. But we bear our burdens and move on. And so it is -- after
much grieving and maudlin songs -- that the CULT OF THE DEAD COW releases two
file packs of five files each, anoints one new member and expands on our
work with the Hong Kong Blondes.

As our young people skip off to school, lunch pails bursting with wholesome
treats and whistling their favorite video bits, we at the CULT OF THE DEAD COW
DISTANCE LEARNING CENTER have labored long and hard to shine a light in the
darkness -- sort of like high-beams along the information superhighway.
Our crack team of learning experts have put together a wack packet of
mind expanding mayhem in the hope that it will be the one thing that keeps our
youth from purchasing firearms, or seeking employment in Redmond.

We take special pride in announcing a new member to our ranks who goes by the
name, SirDystic. He is rumored to be the child of Seymour Cray and an unknown
showgirl. We found him living in a dumpster with a Palm Pilot, a case of
Astroglide and his latest text file. Remember the Internet worm? Imagine the
same thing, only _bigger_. An automated, systemic infection of the Internet --
all made possible because of the success of Bill Gates' dream of a computer in
every home, running Windows. With a little work and SirDystic's file, this is
just one possibility.

It was a long hot summer for the HERD. The heat off the flashpacks and klieg
lights at DefCon and H.O.P.E. were trying, but they come with the territory.
Grandmaster Ratte's breakthrough performance at DefCon was the talk of Las
Vegas, as was Microsoft's idle promise to give cDc Hacker Laureate Mudge the
keys to the kingdom. Kaiser Wilhelm's star braun-nosers, Karan Khanna (head of
NT Marketing) and Paul Leech (one of the main developers and author of the
CIFS specification) promised Mudge a subscription to DevNet for a year and a
link to the L0pht's site from Microsoft's Web page. Waiting - still waiting.

And of the many happy memories at H.O.P.E., the CULT OF THE DEAD COW'S
official announcement of our strategic alliance with the Hong Kong Blondes was
received to deafening applause. The Hong Kong Blondes are a group of computer
scientists and human rights activists who have taken the revolution on-line.
They are active in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. And you can bet you'll be
hearing a lot more about the real meaning of payback if the government of
geriatric kleptocrats don't keep their word on social reform. Check the new
cDc homepage (www.cultdeadcow.com) for future announcements. And support human
rights in China -- the cDc does.

Oh, one last morsel. The CULT OF THE DEAD COW has been requested by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation to take over the EFF's ftp archives. The circle
is now complete. The group that for so long has contributed to the computer
underground will soon become the official custodian of its content. (Look for
a full announcement soon.) And you thought we didn't have a plan. Damn, we're
good.
