The Emperor's New Suit

------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Strange World of Tapu would make a grown crypto-anarchist, unabombin',
cellular-phone crackin', antisocial cyberpunk weep in awe. This Web page is
truly an achievement. It's the one-stop directory for all manner of shady
business.

I wish I could provide the address to the spot, but I can't. Not because it
would be illegal. There's nothing even vaguely illegal on Tapu's site; it
consists almost entirely of links to other Web sites. Yet if we printed that
URL, City Paper and yours truly might find themselves on the receiving end
of a lawsuit from the Software Publishers Association, the trade
organization for the desktop business-software industry.

Last week I wrote about the SPA's initiative aimed at cracking down on
Internet piracy (Cyberpunk, 10/23). What is interesting about this approach
is that the association is not going after those who post illegal copies of
software, but rather those whose Web pages contain pointers to "warez"
sites. Whether those pointers infringe on copyright laws is questionable.

One of the SPA campaign's first targets was the Strange World page, which
included such links. Tapu informed me by E-mail that on September 26 she
received a call from Jeff McGough, president of Intergate, Tapu's Internet
service provider (Tapu prefers not to give out her last name or where she
lives). McGough said he was destroying all of Tapu's Web pages, even those
unconnected to the Strange World page, at the behest of the SPA, which
threatened a lawsuit if he didn't take action within 24 hours. "It was
ludicrous," McGough says. "But neither I nor Tapu had the money to tell them
to take a flying leap."

"I was shocked," Tapu writes. "It was pretty confusing, because my page was
pretty content-free, nothing but links.." (Ironically, once word got around
that Tapu's page was removed, it mysteriously popped up in 23 other
locations-in at least eight different countries-courtesy of on-line
sympathizers. At least a few of these copies can be found pretty easily
through a Yahoo search.)

At first glance the SPA's actions may seem a bit tangential, like the FBI
prosecuting the publishers of the telephone book which held the Ryder ad
that Timothy McVeigh allegedly referred to when shopping for a truck to
drive to Oklahoma in. Naturally this case has the civil libertarians up in
arms. They see SPA's action as a serious threat to free speech.

Robert Costner of Electronic Frontiers Georgia, an advocacy group for
on-line civil liberties, notes that the decision to remove material "was
made not on the merits of the case, but on the threat of civil action. . . .
This is the most chilling aspect of the SPA's actions."

However, Joshua Bauchner, SPA litigation coordinator, argues that using the
right to free speech to defend the existence of warez sites is simply
irrelevant. "Copyright infringement is not protected by the First Amendment,
just like the First Amendment does not give anyone the right to sell drugs,"
he tells me.

This is a valid point. But here is the SPA's dirty little secret: There is
no law forbidding the direct promotion of piracy. You can search the U.S.
Code 17, chapter one-the section covering copyright law-but you won't find a
trace of it. (The code can be found on the Web site of Cornell University's
Legal Information Institute)

Even the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, "The Copyright Act does not expressly
render anyone liable for infringement committed by another" (Sony
Corporation v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 436).

Which is not to say someone can't possibly lose their shirt over it. In the
legal world, Bauchner says, there is a fairly well-known concept called
"contributory infringement," and it's what SPA is basing its suit on.

Contributory infringement, as defined by William Patry in the well-regarded
Copyright Law and Practice, occurs when "the defendant induces, causes, or
materially contributes to a third party's infringing activity." The SPA is
arguing that the creation of sites that have pointers to sites with "warez,"
"hacker," or "cracker" information is promoting or "materially contributing"
to infringement.

SPA is leaning heavily on Patry's definition, which was formed entirely in
connection with cases dealing with older media forms, such as Supreme Court
opinions on the legality of taping television shows at home and of record
stores allowing in-house taping of music. Bauchner also sites a case in
which a department-store chain was successfully sued for allowing an
independent vendor to sell bootleg records in its stores.

As much as Bauchner feels the SPA has a pretty strong case based on these
precedents, he admits there hasn't been a defining case on the matter as it
applies to cyberspace.

How applicable the concept of contributory infringement is to the Web
depends largely on how well it is accepted in the legal community in the
next few years. So heads up.

As for Tapu, she remains unable to put up her home page. "I guess I didn't
realize that anybody can just threaten people with a frivolous lawsuit,"
Tapu writes. "If the victim doesn't have any money, they pretty much have to
do whatever the perpetrator wants."

Taking Technology To The Street

Last week NetAction sponsored a week-long experiment in making Internet
technology more accessible.  With the help of many volunteers, we literally
took the Internet to the street.  The unique event brought together people
with technical expertise and non-profit groups focused on creating access to
technology, teaching computer skills and/or advocating on technology policy.
This all-volunteer effort would be easy for Internet activists to duplicate
in other communities where there is interest in promoting more widespread
access to technology and/or building coalitions around technology policy.

For six days, volunteers staffed a storefront kiosk in San Francisco's Civic
Center area that offered residents and visitors free demonstrations of the
Internet and the opportunity for a hands-on lesson in accessing the World
Wide Web, E-mail and news groups.  By week's end, about 100 people had
visited the kiosk, which was staffed from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily by a total
of 26 volunteers.  In addition to NetAction, 17 organizations and businesses
participated as co-sponsors.

While some visitors were already online and came with very specific
questions, others had never operated a computer.  Many visitors stayed for
an hour or more, and had a real hands-on lesson in accessing the Internet.
Many of the volunteers offered to help again if NetAction organizes another
demo, which I certainly hope to do.

The experience has me convinced that public demonstrations in locations with
significant pedestrian traffic are a viable means of promoting access to
information technology.  The event also helped promote effective citizen
action by linking people who have technical skills with organizations in the
community that provide information technology access, training, and/or
policy advocacy.  Publicity about the Internet demo helped raise public
awareness of the many  organizations and businesses that participated, and
the event provided a positive and meaningful volunteer experience for those
who participated.

Internet technology was put to use in organizing the event.  A majority of
the volunteers who staffed the demo were recruited by announcements sent to
E-mail lists and posted on web sites.  The event was publicized on the web
as well as through more traditional media.  Activists interested in
organizing similar events in other communities are welcome to contact me for
further advice at: akrause@igc.org.

The Internet demo served serveral purposes:

- People who were already are online were able to get answers to specific
technical questions.

- People who have computers but are not online were introduced to the web,
E-mail, and news groups, and provided with referrals to organizations and
businesses that could help with training, and with identifying and
contacting Internet service providers.

- People who had not previously used computers had a chance to see what the
technology offered and learn about resources in the community that could
help them get started.

- People with technical expertise had opportunities to share their knowledge
with others.

- Community organizations working to promote technology access and/or
advocate on technology policy received positive exposure.

- Community groups seeking to incorporate technology into their work turned
to NetAction for assistance.  One volunteer with technical expertise was
connected to a grassroots group seeking assistance in developing a web site,
and a local business contacted NetAction about donating several used
computers to a community technology center.

From: "J. Richard Wilson  <usfmd97t@ibmmail.com>
Subject: 3--ACLU Files Supreme Court Motion Over CDA

WASHINGTON -- In an October 31 press release, the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) announced that it had filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court
to affirm a lower court's decision that declared the Communications Decency
Act (CDA) unconstitutional government censorship of the Internet.

The ACLU's motion, which was in response to the Government's appeal of the
District Court's June ruling, requests that the Supreme Court issue a "summary
affirmation", which would mean that the Court upholds the lower court's
decision without any further inquiry.  Although such a decision by the Court
is rare in instances where federal statutes are in question, the ACLU argues
that the lower court's findings were not only extensive and undisputed by the
Government, but that the Government has not raised "any legitimate argument
against summary affirmance."

A second brief was filed the same day by the American Library Association
(ALA) on behalf of the nearly 30 organizations and more than 50,000 individual
Internet users it is representing.  The brief acknowledges that summary
affirmance would be appropriate, but also notes that it would not oppose a
review of the case by the Court.  The ACLU also stated that it is fully
prepared for such a hearing.

After the court's decision, the Government had 30 days to file a Notice of
Appeal with the District Court.  Following that, the Goverment then had 60
days to file its appeal, called a Jurisdictional Statement, with the Supreme
Court.  At the end of that period, the Government requested and was granted a
30 day extension.

Interestingly enough, the Goverment does not contest the findings of the lower
court or the constitutionality of its decision, nor does it request a "summary
reversal", which would mean the Supreme Court reverses the lower court's
ruling without further examination.  Instead, the Government offers an
entirely new argument not previously presented to the District Court: that the
CDA only applies to individuals who "knowingly" transmit "indecent" material
to minors.

The Goverment's new interpretation of the CDA is inconsistent with previous
arguments in which it had suggested that the use of site-rating software and
age-verification could protect legitimate speakers from prosecution.  The
question raised is: if the CDA only applies to individuals who knowingly break
the law, then why is there a need to protect "legitimate speakers"?

As it was written, the Communications Decency Act makes it unlawful for
individuals to transmit or make available material that is "indecent" or
"patently offensive" on computer networks, most notably the Internet, if that
material can be viewed by a minor.  Punishment for violation of the CDA can
result in up to two years in jail and/or fines up to $250,000.

"The stakes in this case are undeniably high," said Christopher Hansen, the
ACLU lawyer who argued the case before the three-judge court in Philadelphia.
"Whatever the Supreme Court decides will determine the government's ability to
regulate a technology that will undoubtedly serve as the basis for global
communication into the 21st century."

Jim Taylor (jtaylor@tcd.net)

Another Point of view on the message from
"FLAMETHROWER Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)"

>Private businesses pose the more sinister threat to
>free expression on-line.
>Take America On-line (AOL), which now boasts over six million members.
>In a move akin to the paranoid antics of a kindergarten schoolmarm,
>AOL this summer started deleting messages posted in Spanish and

>"terms of service" agreement allows it to boot anyone, anytime, for

To me I would interpret this as quit AOL, Compuserve, or any
on-line service that censors its customers. Join up with any of
the thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISP) that don't
censor, but just give you a standard SLIP or PPP type account.

>Don't forget net-filtering software. While busily touting itself as

>inexplicably, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's censorship archive.
>NetNanny cuts off AIDS resources including the sci.med.aids and
>clari.tw.health.aids newsgroups. SurfWatch bans domestic partner web

>Wellness" site.

Yes, this is correct, for those that are controlled under
net-filtering software.  The majority of people affected are
children and employees at some company.  Since all of the above
software come with a setable password, parents can set up what
sites they want their children to see.  It is not static, and can
be setup with different degrees of restriction.  Most companies
don't provide net access for employees to "surf", but to gather
pertinent information. It is the companies, or parents right to
control access to information.  As for employees, they can AND
SHOULD get their own Internet accounts at home so they can see what
is in cyberspace, on their own time, and in a non censored way.

If we as netizens don't provide a way to control access to
children, the government will do it for us, or at least try real
hard, as they did with the Communications Decency Act (CDA).

>If [censorship] happens, netizens will find their rosy vision of the Net as
>the birthplace of a new form of democracy overwhelmed by the sad
>reality of a new media oligarchy aborning.

Yes I entirely agree, The net as a whole should be censor free, but
filters should be in place to protect, those that need it, ie
children.  The same way I support Alcohol should be able to be
purchased by an Adult, but we put restrictions on children from
purchasing Alcohol, like it should be.

From: Jeffrey Hinchey <jhinchey@navnet.net>
To: "'cudigest@sun.soci.niu.edu'" <cudigest@sun.soci.niu.edu>

Dear Sirs,

In Cu Digest #8.73, you included a note from Slim Simpson, warning of
 a potential scam of some sort by a company by a Fastfoto of Pomano
 Beach, Florida.  In the header the author suggested that he was
 unsure of whether it was appropriate for the CU-Digest or not, and
 personally I think it was not.

Obviously Mr. or Ms. Simpson, was frustrated at the inability to lash
 out at the person who had spammed their mailbox.  Lately, with more
 an more newcomers to the net, I have noticed that one thing they seem
 to find out quickly is their supposed right to be spamless, and their
 little private electronic domain, called their mailbox.

Many of these same people invite advertising material like flyers,
 magazines, coupons, to their household door or mailbox on a daily
 basis, but never confront these advertisers.  Advertising material
 created by the decimation of forests, pollution of the environment by
 the processing of such, and ending up as filler for our garbage
 dumps.  Amazingly only 4% of the recipients will ever be interested
 in the message that these advertising materials contain.

Yet this person will strike out from their armchair, in their little
 form of civil protest against an action they do not agree with, in
 relative obscurity.  Mean while they sit passively while shots are
 fired outside their home, children are being abused, homeless people
 starve, and guard the sanctity of their mailbox.

The bottom line is they could have just deleted the note, went on
 their merry way and ignored the invasion of privacy.  Instead they
 chose to track this down, and highlight it in some sort of shroud of
 scam and sent it in to CU-Digest, after their inability to express
 their displeasure to the offending party.

Personally I would accept my mailbox having a few useless nuisance
 messages, from recyclable electrons if it meant stopping the
 destructive process of our current advertising means.  Maybe it was
 not a spam.  Maybe they just left their email address off to protect
 themselves from individuals who want to stop this method of
 advertising  Maybe they thought they might end up scanning material
 of a questionable nature, considering the way certain individuals are
 communicating with other individuals today.  Maybe they should have
 added the word Adult, then their obscurity would make more sense

There were people who did not like the introduction of the printing
 press at one time either, and of course they are no longer living.  I
 just think that this message was NOT appropriate for the CU-Digest,
 but hopefully will spark debate.
  The thousands of people who regularly send a message to someone who
 has spammed them, just has to lighten up, and learn how to use some
 filtering software.  Then maybe everyone can communicate without
 destroying our environment.

This is just my opinion, on recyclable material I might add, :)).

I have two items to block web censorship:

1) Web pages via email.

Send a url (in body, not subject) to: web@glr.com. It returns the web
page via email. Blank email for more info. Password protected pages can
be accesses, as well as raw html or text can be returned.

This was written up in cnet news and the Atlanta Jouranl & Constitution.
The ACLU finds it a mixed blessing...

2) I have setup a web page with programs / instructions for defeating the

_MIDS publishes second legal article, examining InterNIC

_Matrix Information and Directory Services (MIDS) publishes
second in a series of legal articles._

     11 October 1996, Austin, Texas

                         The TLD Problem

Your domain, if it is under COM, ORG, or NET, can be taken away
if anyone anywhere in the world claims a trademark on it.  Top
level domains (TLDs) are basic technical features of the Domain
Name System (DNS), and they have recently become focusses of lots
of money and big controversy
<URL:http://www.mids.org/mn/608/tld.html>.

                      The New Legal Article

To help clarify this TLD problem, MIDS has just published the
second article in its series of legal articles
<URL:http://www.mids.org/legal/>.

     John S. Quarterman, President of MIDS, says, ``MIDS is
frequently asked about the TLD problem, so we sought qualified
legal counsel to produce opinions on aspects of it.  We found
Mikki Barry, who, with her Georgetown Law degree, experience as
counsel for an Internet software company, and writing ability,
has just the right qualifications for the task.''

     This second article is entitled: ``A detailed analysis on
the InterNIC's dispute policy.''  It covers legal aspects of the
InterNIC's domain registration policy in detail, with analysis.
It is available for $250 from MIDS.  The introductory article is
still available for free, but this second article and the rest of
the articles in the series are $250 each.  Quarterman remarks,
``We like to give things to the Internet community, so we
released the first article for free.  However, we think the
second one is very economically priced at $250.''
