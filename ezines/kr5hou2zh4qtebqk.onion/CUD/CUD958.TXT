     COMPETITION FOR INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION NEAR;
           APPLICATIONS TO BECOME A REGISTRAR OPENS

WASHINGTON, DC, July 21, 1997 -- Self-regulation of the Internet
took a step forward today with the announcement that applications
to become a registrar of Internet domain names will be accepted.
The action, announced by the interim Policy Oversight Committee
(iPOC), is expected to result in the establishment of competitive
registrars worldwide.

A plan recommended by the predecessor to iPOC, the Internet Ad
Hoc Committee (IAHC), calls for the creation of new generic Top
Level Domains (gTLDs) and the selection of additional registrars
from around the world.  Each will compete to register Internet
domain names under the new gTLDs.  Currently there is one
registrar, Network Solutions, Inc., for the three existing gTLDs,
.com, .net, and .org.  It is expected that those gTLDs will become
assimilated into the new plan in April, 1998.

The IAHC recommendation was adopted with the signing of the
generic Top Level Domain-Memorandum of Understanding (gTLD-MoU),
which is designed to effect Internet self-regulation in the
registration of generic domain names.  The IAHC, some of whose
members are participating in the iPOC, concluded in February,
1997, that seven new gTLDs would be added to the Internet
addressing system.  Currently, there are approximately 145
organizations that are signatories or intended signatories
to the gTLD-MoU.

Each registrar will be entitled to register domain names in
all of the new gTLDs for Internet users anywhere in the world.
Principles of free market and competition will apply in the
new system, and registrars will compete among themselves for
pricing, service and reliability.  The new system also
introduces domain name "portability," meaning that consumers
will be able to switch among registrars keeping their domain
name.

A Council of Registrars (CORE), made up of all the new registrars,
will administer the central databases and provide stability and
consistency to the system.

"We are gratified to see the results of this open process," said
David Maher, chair of the iPOC and a senior partner with the law
firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, in Chicago.  "There were
months of open discussion and significant modifications of the
first proposals. The entire process was initiated by the Internet
Society (ISOC) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA),
and we were guided throughout by their principles," he added.

To become a gTLD registrar, applicants must submit an application
form (available at <http://www.gtld-mou.org>) and supporting
documentation before October 16, 1997, to Arthur Andersen LLP,
which will receive the applications.  The decision when to
reopen the process for submitting applications to qualify as
registrars, will be made in the future.  Each application must
be accompanied by a US$10,000 application fee.  To qualify, an
applicant must show a certain level of available capital and
commercial liability insurance, and must have a functioning
domain name.  They must further commit to having the equivalent
of five full time employees in the registration activities.

Applicants which are selected as a result of the application
process must sign a CORE Memorandum of Understanding (CORE-MoU)
outlining their rights and responsibilities in the registration
business and as a member of CORE.  Before beginning registration
activities, they must also conform to operational and technical
requirements that will be determined by CORE.

CORE is expected to begin start-up activities and preparations
for registration on August 15, 1997, prior to the closing of
the application period, with its membership consisting of the
applicants who have qualified as registrars at that time.  Later
applicants will join CORE as they are qualified as registrars.
The first task of CORE will be to design and coordinate the
technology and operational requirements for putting the
registration system on-line later this year.

ABOUT THE GTLD-MOU
The generic Top Level Domain-Memorandum of Understanding
(gTLD-MoU) is the international governance framework in which
policies for the administration and enhancement of the
Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) are developed and deployed.
This includes, among other things, the addition of new gTLDs,
selection of new domain name registrars, and development of
equitable dispute resolution mechanisms for conflicts between
parties concerning rights to domain names.

The gTLD-MoU attempts to balance the many (and often disparate)
interests of the many stakeholders in the Internet DNS.  Toward
that goal, the MoU is intentionally designed to be open-ended
and will be adapted to evolving requirements.  The MoU is an
explicit recognition of a need to formalize the consultative
policy framework for continued evolution of the Internet DNS.

Subject: File 3--Cellular Tracking Technologies

A recent article from the San Jose Mercury News by Berry Witt ("Squabble
puts non-emergency phone number on hold") raises several important
questions -- questions I think are relavant to the CUD's readership...

Does anybody remember the FBI's request that cell phone companies must
build in tracking technology to their systems that allows a person's
position to be pin pointed by authorities?  That suggested policy resulted
in a flurry of privacy questions and protests from the industry, suggesting
such requirements would force them to be uncompetitive in the global
marketplace.  The article, dated July 20, (which was focused on 911
cellular liability issues) suggests federal authorities may have worked out
an end run around the controversy.  The article states:

 "The cellular industry is working to meet a federal requirement that by
next spring, 911 calls from cellular phones provide dispatchers the
location of the nearest cell site and that within five years, cellular
calls provide dispatchers the location of the caller within a 125-meter
radius. "

On its face, this seems reasonable and it is a far cry from the real time
tracking requirements of any cell phone that is turned on (The FBI's
original request).  But by next spring, this tracking system will be in
place and on line.  I have heard no public debate about the privacy
implications regarding this "Federal Requirement", nor has there been any
indication that this information will be restricted to 911 operators.

Will this information be available to law enforcement officials if they
have a warrant?  If they don't have a warrant?  Will this information be
secured so enterprising criminals won't have access to it?  Exactly WHAT
kind of security is being implemented so it WON'T be accessible to the
general public.

This smacks of subterfuge.  By cloaking the cellular tracking issue in the
very real issue of the 911 location system, the federal government and law
enforcement agencies have circumvented the legitimate privacy questions
that arose from their initial Cellular tracking request.

[Centerfold article in this week's The Irish People]

No Ceasefire on the Web: Basque Website Under Attack.
Are Irish Republican Sites Next?

by Eugene McElroy
July 26, 1997

As this article is being written, the IRA is announcing its plan for a
cease-fire in conjunction with Sinn Fein becoming a full partner of
the talks process. But while the six counties take a step back from the
precipice and the world looks on in hope, the war in cyber-space is
heating up to unprecedented levels.

In a development that has serious and direct implications for the
work of Irish Republican cyber-activists the world over, the Institute
for Global Communications (IGC) on Friday, July 18th, suspended a
World Wide Web site supporting Basque independence in Spain, the
Euskal Herria Journal (EHJ) site.

Euskal Herria Journal is a New York-based organization supporting
Basque independence in Spain and France. The Journal's goal was to
publish "information often ignored by the international media and to
build communication bridges for a better understanding of the
conflict."

The site also contained articles on human rights, politics, language,
and lawful Basque groups working for autonomy, as well as a
collection of hyperlinks to sites with views opposed to the ETA.

EHJ has been victimized by a world-wide campaign inspired and no
doubt organized by the Spanish government in an attempt to muzzle
the voice of the Basque independence movement in the wake of the
killing of a hostage, Miguel Angel Blanco, by ETA guerrillas last
Tuesday (July 15th). Blanco had been taken prisoner by ETA, who
demanded the release of Basque political prisoners, or at least
grouping them together in a few prisons in the Basque Country in
exchange for Blanco's release. In a highly charged atmosphere that
riveted the attention of the entire Spanish-speaking world, the
government's predictably refused ETA's demands. Blanco was found
severely wounded. He died a short time later in the hospital on
Tuesday.

By Thursday, reports were coming out from Spain that a systematic
campaign, conducted under the auspices of the Spanish government,
was underway to isolate not only ETA and the political party Herri
Batasuna (HB), but also anyone identified as an "accomplice of ETA."

It came to my attention on Thursday morning, July 17th, while
reading the electronic version of El Pais, a newspaper of record in
Montevideo, Uruguay. El Pais ran an article from the Spanish news
agency EFE saying that ETA and HB were now totally banned from the
Spanish media. But more than that, a group called El Movimiento por
la Paz, el Desarme y la Libertad (Movement for Peace, Disarmament
and Liberty-MPDL) was that day beginning a campaign to drive
"immediately" off the Internet web site any pages containing ETA, HB
or Basque independence material, such as the EHJ site. Pressure was to
be applied on web-site servers to deny these pages their facilities.

Within an hour after reading the article in El Pais, a message turned
up on the mailing list for Club Atletico Penarol, the premier soccer
team in Uruguay, whose fortunes I follow with interest. Normally,
the list is for soccer-related items only. But there appeared from a site
in Hong Kong an anonymous message that was very long.

Without any explanation and with many hysterical references to
terrorism, the message urged readers to inundate, or mail-bomb, the
Basque web sites and the sites of the servers that host these pages.

By the next day, Friday July 18th, IGC received a huge number of
protest e-mail messages asking for the removal of one of its Web sites.
Marta, from the EHJ office, reported that Peacenet was choked with
over 7,000 messages demanding the removal of the EHJ page.
Protestors said that the site "supported terrorism" because it contained
material sympathetic to Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), the armed
independence group that has committed widely denounced political
violence in Spain.

This volume was far more than anything IGC-Peacenet could ever
accommodate, and their hand was quickly forced. "It is only under
protest that we have suspended the Euskal Herria Journal site, so that
we can continue to provide basic Internet services to our other
clients," said IGC acting executive director Scott Weikart. "We call on
all those concerned that legal political speech can be forcibly censored
by Internet attacks to stand with us and protest these tactics. If it can
happen to one web site, it can happen to any web site," he said.

During the past week, IGC reported that "...[our] system has suffered
from organized, malicious attacks designed not to communicate with
anyone, but simply to make [our] computers unusable. These included
'mailbombings,' or a large volume of repetitive e-mail messages
intended to overwhelm the computers handling e-mail, and 'denial
of service' assaults aimed at overwhelming IGC connections to the
Internet."

Program coordinator Maureen Mason added, "Whether IGC is right
or wrong to publish this site, the Internet community should not
tolerate censorship by e-mail-bombing. It's like vandalizing a
bookstore to protest a book."

Audrie Krause, director of the Internet policy and educational
organization NetAction, responded to the call for support. She urged
the Internet community to "mirror" the controversial site, saying
"IGC is under attack by cyberspace vigilantes because the organization
provided a forum for proponents of a controversial political
viewpoint."

Aiding the attack was the Spanish government's own official request,
tendered to the American news service CNN, to de-link the EHJ web
site from CNN's main page. CNN has refused to do this. What lends
suspicion to the notion of a government coordinated "peace
movement" is that although the small IGC server was "bombed," the
"bombing campaign" was coordinated enough that no attempt has
been made to mail-bomb the CNN offices. This would have been a
public-relations disaster for the government and the movement. It
implies a high degree of coordination to make sure that the campaign
did not spin out of its makers' control; rather astounding, given the
highly-decentralized nature of the Internet.

Starting to sound familiar? To any Irish activist, it should. A "peace
movement," with seemingly endless resources and media access (i.e.,
in cooperation with the government and no doubt the intelligence
services), springs to life after a tragic incident, isolates that incident
outside of the wider conflict it is part of, and mobilizes sectors of a
war-weary people, as well as a world-wide audience, with dramatic
visual images and verbal appeals without context but loaded with
vague references to "peace" and about "terrorism," to attack the
insurgent side of the conflict. And if you don't hysterically and
unequivocally condemn the terrorists, then you, too, are a terrorist.

We've seen it in Ireland more than once: the so-called "Peace
Women," "Peace People," "Peace Trains," and later incarnations, such
as "Peace Movements" whose sole demand is the surrender of the
other side. And if surrender is not forthcoming, they call on
"responsible forces" to "eliminate" the problem. It is a page right out
of Frank Kitson's counter-insurgency bible, Low Intensity Operations:
Subversion, Insurgency, and Peacekeeping.

This kind of "peace movement" calls on everyone to "cooperate with
the police" but neglects police and army brutality. In the case of the
Basques, the very week that the MPDL was carrying out its
mail-bombing campaign the former Spanish prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez admitted in the New York Times on July 17th that his
government authorized secret death squads against ETA and HB
members. He admitted to 27 deaths caused by the squads, some being
cases of mistaken identity. No doubt the actual number is far higher.
All this escaped MPDL's attention.

No one wants violence or wants war, and the decision to enter into
one is fraught with danger and pain. The desire for peace and order is
universal. But a clear distinction must be made between a genuine
desire for peace, and the manipulation of peace rhetoric, imagery and
symbolism for the purpose of hiding the political goals of the state
sponsors of the conflict.

The implications for Irish Republican cyber-activists are obvious. How
long will it be before a motley collection of Workers Party/Democratic
Left functionaries, Fine Gael, Tories, Loyalists, "peace people," "peace
trains," and assorted clergy, no doubt with the invisible hand of a
number of security and intelligence psy-ops departments showing the
way, seize on a real or imagined tragedy and are mobilized to
"mail-bomb" the servers of the various Republican web sites or Irish
pages that have links to The Irish People or APRN, or mailing lists
like Ireland_list?

Indeed, Ireland_list is under attack this very week from a number of
loyalist disrupters whose names and e-mail addresses are by now well
known to the hundreds of Ireland_list subscribers.

It is well known that in the cyber wars, Republican activists have
beaten the loyalists and the British Information Services to the punch.

An Phoblacht and The Irish People, to name only two sources, are
now widely distributed over the net. The quality of these various
pages and lists, commented on here weekly, is well known and stands
in marked contrast to the racist, jingoist bigotry that passes for the
loyalist lists. Just check the UDA Home page or Conrad Bladey's
Unionist-L mailing list for yourself and see.

What's more, they know they've been beaten to the draw, and they
don't like it one bit. The mail-bombing of lists, the threats to
subscribers and activists, are really all that's left to them.

What's more, the Republican cyber-activists don't have to engage in
such tactics. We don't have to engage in mail-bombing, threats or
other acts of intimidation. We have such confidence in our own
argument that we will meet the loyalists or British head to head
on-line. But that's the last thing they want.

Further, Republican cyber-activists encourage everyone to view the
loyalist/Orange/British web sites. Far from wishing to prevent their
dissemination, Republicans want as many persons as possible to read
for themselves, confident that any fair-minded person, any democrat,
will soon be repelled by the bigotry they will see. Ireland_list
welcomed news postings from loyalist sources, but the light of day
proved too much for the cyber-bowlers and they began to disrupt the
list the way a poor-sport chess player might scatter the pieces when
s/he realizes a defeat.

You won't find links to Republican sources on Orange/loyalist pages,
and you won't find loyalist mailing lists accepting postings from
AP/RN. That should tell you something.

No one can know for sure how the next swing on the cyber-war will
strike. The example of the suppression of the Basque list is extremely
ominous. Our turn might be next. Take it as a warning: When the
time does come and Republican cyber-activists call out for your
support to defend a list or a web site, you must be ready to give it.
Whether you own a terminal or not, Irish Republicans cannot
relinquish the hard-won ground on the Internet.

Please support our Basque friends. Contact Peacenet today and
demand they stand by EHJ and not cave in to state-sponsored
cybermania.


 Who are IGC and APC?

The Institute for Global Communications is a California-based
10-year-old nonprofit organization that provides Web hosting, e-mail
access and other Internet services primarily to activists working for
peace, economic and social justice, human rights and environmental
sustainability around the world.

Since 1986, when PeaceNet was founded in Palo Alto, Cal., IGC has
been growing and expanding, to bring Internet tools to organizations
and individuals working on peace, justice, human rights,
environmental protection, labor issues, and conflict resolution.

IGC is the American member of the Association for Progressive
Communications, a global partnership of computer networks that
link activists around the world.

In its own words, "The Association for Progressive Communications
(APC) is a global network of networks whose mission is to empower
and support organizations, social movements and individuals
through the use of information and communication technologies to
build strategic communities and initiatives for the purpose of making
meaningful contributions to human development, social justice,
participatory democracies and sustainable societies."

Composed of a consortium of 25 international member networks,
APC offers vital links of communication to over 50,000 NGOs,
activists, educators, policy-makers, and community leaders in 133
countries.

APC member networks' main purpose is to develop and maintain the
informational system that allows for geographically dispersed groups
who are working for social and environmental change to coordinate
activities on-line at a much cheaper rate than can be done by fax,
telephone, or for-profit computer networks. APC is committed to
making these tools available to persons from all regions in the world.

IGC's mission statement gives its purpose: "To expand and inspire
movements for peace, economic and social justice, human rights and
environmental sustainability around the world by providing and
developing accessible computer networking tools."


 Statement of IGC-Peacenet on Basque website

"Until July 18, 1997, [IGC] was the homepage of the Euskal Herria
Journal, a Web site hosted by the Institute for Global
Communications.

"IGC was forced to suspend the site, as a result of a sustained
campaign of e-mail 'mailbombing,' a large volume of repetitive
e-mail intended to make our computers unusable. It is only under
protest that we suspend the Euskal Herria Journal site, so that we can
continue to provide basic Internet services, like e-mail, for our nearly
13,000 subscribers. We call on organizations and individuals
concerned about freedom of expression on the Internet to stand with
us in protest of these tactics, and join the statement of support below.

"The Institute for Global Communications is a 10-year-old nonprofit
organization that provides Web hosting, e-mail access and other
Internet services primarily to activists working for peace, economic
and social justice, human rights and environmental sustainability
around the world.

"IGC hosted a Web site for the Euskal Herria Journal, a New
York-based organization supporting Basque independence in Spain
and France, whose goal was to publish 'information often ignored by
the international media, and to build communication bridges for a
better understanding of the conflict.'

"This month, IGC has received a huge number of protest e-mail
messages asking us to remove the Euskal Herria Journal site because
of sections protestors say supported Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), the
armed independence group that has committed widely denounced
political violence in Spain. The site also contained articles on human
rights, politics, language, and other Basque groups working for
autonomy, as well as a collection of hyperlinks to sites with views
opposing ETA.

"Many, many messages to IGC were legitimate expressions of protest.
We respect the people who wrote them and, as a humanitarian
organization, we take their views into account.

"For almost two weeks, however, IGC's system has suffered from
organized, malicious attacks designed not to communicate with us,
but simply to bring its servers to a standstill. These 'mailbombings,' or
a volume of e-mail intended to render our computers unusable,
include:

Hundreds of duplicate messages sent over and over again - huge
message files containing garbage or one phrase repeated thousands of
times.

 Mail with no return address, automated to go out continually to
bog down our mail system.

 Large volumes of mail with forged return addresses routed through
random Internet providers, so they can't be answered or traced.

"This destructive campaign has overwhelmed our ability to keep our
system running, and we have made the difficult decision to suspend
the Euskal Herria Journal Web site--under protest--so that we can
continue to serve the many other individuals and organizations who
depend on our services. While the site is suspended, we call on all
those concerned that legal political speech can be forcibly censored by
"mailbombing" attacks to protest the tactics used against us.

"If it can happen to us, it can happen to anyone."


STATEMENT OF SUPPORT

Statement from NetAction (San Francisco, Cal.)

July 18, 1997

"IGC is under attack by cyberspace vigilantes because the organization
provided a forum for proponents of a controversial political
viewpoint. This is precisely why free speech in cyberspace is so
important. It's crucial that the Internet community demonstrate
support for IGC by mirroring the site that prompted this unwarranted
attack. The mailbombers need to know that vigilante censorship is
just as unacceptable as government censorship."

Audrie Krause, Executive Director


Contact IGC/Peacenet and tell them to restore the Basque websites.
When you call them, identify yourself as an activist in the struggle for
a united Ireland. Ask IGC: If this can happen to our Basque comrades,
is this the type of treatment we can also expect at some point when
some MI5/Special Branch "Peace Movement" is mobilized to knock
Irish Republican sites off of the Internet?

Please remember that IGC are not the enemy. However disappointig
their action was, they had the proverbial gun to their head. They
hosted EHJ originally and in my experience with them were always
supportive of the efforts of cyber-Republicans. It's though by some
activists that even though IGC backed down in the face of the
mail-bomb onslaught, IGC certainly objects to it. The action was taken
under protest and "duress." Let them know you support them in the
struggle for freedom of expression on the Web, as in this case with
EHJ.

I regret to say that it is not possible at this time to give out the phone
number and e-mail address of EHJ to those wishing to extend support.
The BASQUE-L mailing list being run from CUNY was also
mail-bombed and discontinued by the server.

Thanks to Marta from EHJ and to Peter Urban from the IRSC for
providing materials and quotes for this article.
