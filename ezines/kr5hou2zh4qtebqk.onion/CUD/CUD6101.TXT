              Holocaust revisionism goes up in flame wars

                                  by
                             K.K. CAMPBELL


It was 56 years ago today that Germans awoke to find the Nazis had
spent the night terrorizing Jews and destroying property in something
called "Crystal Night." It was a test-run pogrom for the Holocaust to
follow.

Once upon a time, net.news (the Internet's public discussion forums)
was swamped with flame wars about the Holocaust. They'd be found
anywhere -- in newsgroups like alt.conspiracy, soc.history,
soc.culture.canada, misc.headlines, alt.individualism etc.

One of the most persistent Nazi-apologists, Dan Gannon
(dgannon@banished.com), wildly spammed Holocaust-denying material,
either not understanding or not caring about netiquette -- that is, you
post appropriate material to appropriate groups. Thousands, from dozens
of newsgroups, complained. Gannon's posts were bad enough, but they
always brought rebuttal and endlessly repeated arguments.

Today, most of these debates are found in one newsgroup:
alt.revisionism -- dedicated to discussing "Holocaust revisionism," the
claim that the Nazi extermination of Jews and other distinct peoples is
a "hoax" exacted upon millions of unwary non-Jews.

Anti-racist and anti-fascist online activists continue to track Gannon
and his pals around the 9,000-odd newsgroups. One such hunter is
Canada's Ken McVay (kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca). McVay, 53, came to
Canada in 1967 from the U.S. and is now a Canadian citizen (holds dual
citizenship). He's Canada's foremost online anti-revisionist warrior.

I've been reading his stuff for years.

                              TRUE COLORS

"When I first got started on this, everyone was sort of out there on
their own," McVay told eye in a phone interview from his Vancouver
Island home. "Almost by accident, working groups started coordinating
their efforts." McVay works closely with Danny Keren (dzk@cs.brown.edu)
and Jamie McCarthy (k044477@hobbes.kzoo.edu), among others.

The goal is not censorship. "I am absolutely, unequivocally opposed to
any kind of censorship," McVay says.

This is a real shift in McVay's thinking. I vividly recall reading
McVay his posts from about two years ago, where he'd vehemently defend
Canadian anti-hate speech laws.

"I don't anymore. I think it's the biggest possible mistake." What
changed his mind? "Dealing with these guys on a daily basis for over
two years. Seeing how easy it is to shoot them down. And it is. The
most intellectual among them are stupid and completely inept when it
comes to historical research. And, of course, they are liars. That
being the case, why on Earth would anyone want to shut them up or force
them underground? I want to know who I'm dealing with. I want to know
where they are. And I want to know how their minds work."

To see their true colors, McVay and compatriots badger and prod
revisionists until they drop the scholarly pretense by, say, calling
McVay a "Jew-lover" or complaining Hitler unfortunately missed the
parents of some Jewish netter. It happens regularly.

"These online discussions are not aimed at getting Gannon and his pals
to change their minds," McVay says. "That ain't gonna happen. It's to
reach the rest - - such as the new users that pop up every September in
universities and stumble on this stuff. Many don't know how Nazis
operate. Most racists don't go around with a little patch on their
shoulder proclaiming: `I hate Jews, or blacks, or natives.' But it's
there. We work to bring it out in the open."

                         A.R. AS TESTING GROUND

McVay and company are working on putting together a book, a primer on
Holocaust-denial techniques. (He hasn't approached a publisher yet.)
You often see the results of this ongoing research in alt.revisionism .
McVay chuckles about having rabid anti-Semites ever at hand to help
write it.

"We throw out a chapter when we think it's done, content-wise. If the
revisionists ignore it completely, then we know it's finished. If they
respond, we say, `Ah! We missed that trick, calling a maple tree a
Porsche.' So we add that argument in." A month later, they upload the
chapter again.

McVay says the "classic" revisionist tactic is misrepresentation of
text. Outright lies.

"They'll cite a historical text: `K.K. Campbell says on page 82 of his
famous book that nobody died at Auschwitz.' Then you go to the Library
of Congress and look up K.K. Campbell, page 82, and what you find he
really said was, `It was a nice day at Dachau.' They get away with this
because they know goddamn well most people don't have time to rush off
to the Library of Congress. But people read that and say to themselves,
`Who would lie about such a thing when it's so easy to prove them
wrong? They must be telling the truth.' "

The years of refutation have resulted in anti-revisionists transcribing
mass amounts of death camp evidence and testimony into computer text
files. McVay saved them. Soon netters requested the material. It began
to take up so much time, he automated the process. You send an email
request, the computer sends you back the file(s).

The archive is now maybe 60 megs and may swell to over a gig in 1995.
Write email to ADDRESS TK with the message GET HOLOCAUST/INDEX --
you'll be sent a huge index of Holocaust files (other files, too, on
fascist racist-right groups). If you like the convenience of gopher,
check out jerusalem1.datasrv.co.il .

Revisionists often assert McVay secretly gets operating funds from
Jews.

"I don't," McVay says. "The hard-drives are spread out on a table with
a Canadian Tire fan blowing right at them. I can't afford to replace
things, if it breaks, it's gone. However, I'm upfront -- if I get
support money, I'll take it, Jewish or not. The fact that a Jewish
organization would offer several grand to help wouldn't change the
value of the historical data." He'd like to put it all on CD-ROM.

"The Internet has to be a revisionist's worst communications
nightmare," McVay says. "They can't ignore it, because, as you and I
know, in 10-15 years everyone in North America is going to read stuff
through the Internet.

"And that's the beauty of the Internet: once it's refuted in an honest
and academic fashion, you can't run away from it," McVay says.

When the latest revisionist recruit charges in with the same old
pamphlets, it's almost effortless for anyone to request a file and
reply: "We covered this two years ago. Here is the massive refutation
of that so-called scholarly report."

It's there. For everyone. Forever.

                 RANKING THE ALT.REVISIONISTS

                                  by
                             K.K. CAMPBELL


Last week, eye Net focused on Ken McVay, battle-hardened
anti-revisionist warrior against net.Nazis and holocaust deniers alike
who cruise  the net.

McVay and cohorts endeavor to demonstrate that under every single
Holocaust denier you find an anti-Semite/racist/fascist -- no matter
how "scholarly" a front may be presented.

Newsgroup alt.revisionism has housed a changing cast of Holocaust
deniers over the years. To help guide the newcomer through the raging
flame wars, eye presents the current crew rated for denial motivations
and cyberspace posting style.

eye surveyed two dozen contributors who wage war with Holocaust deniers
on a regular or semi-regular basis. While some polled were inclined to
just give all revisionists 1 in smarts, it was understood this wouldn't
be very useful to newcomers. More importantly, if all rated 1, then
it's impossible to measure the intelligence of Tim McCarthy.

This chart will be posted permanently in eye's online Web site --
http://www.interlog.com/eye/Misc/Alt.revisionism/Rev.html . The chart
can be updated, ratings recalculated, as new net.nazis and kin wander
in. Useful tool for a.r newcomers.

(McVay suggests eye add a new category -- the BSI or Berg Spittle
Index. Using Friedrich Berg as a perfect 10 in spluttering vitriol, he
says Gannon would come in at 9.9 and Hoffman at 7.5. These are, of
course, but the most preliminary of ratings...)

                         KILL (FILE) THE NAZIS

Deborah Lipstadt argues in her recent book Denying The Holocaust
(Penguin, $13.99, paper) that anti-revisionists should not just yell,
but should refute revisionists --and then ridicule will issue forth
from that. This is particularly relevant to cyberspace, which has no
"central office."

Netters who simply don't wanna see net.Nazi shit can use the all-
important kill files. You'll find a copy of the Kill File FAQ
(Frequently Asked Questions) in eye archives to help explain to you how
to use them. (Use gopher or Web and look in eye's Miscellaneous
directory.)

A kill file "tells" your news reader (the software that organizes all
those net.news/Usenet posts) to filter out specific articles. You can
kill all posts coming from a particular person, or a particular site,
or on a particular subject.

Subject: File 3--USSC Rules "Defendants must Know" in Child Porn Cases

((MODERATORS' Note: The following USSC decision should make sysops
breathe a bit easier, because it requires that prosecutors show that
defendants in "child pornography" cases know that the subjects are
minors)).

Source: Chicago Tribune, Nov 30 1994 (p. 10)

                     CHILD PORNOGRAPHY LAW UPHELD
         IN 7-2 RULING, SUPREME COURT EDITS INEXACT PHRASING

   The Supreme Court salvaged the federal law against child
pornography Tuesday by editing it to make clear that the government
must prove that a defendant knew that the performers in sexually
explicit photographs or films were under the age of 18.

   Congress almost certainly intended to include a knowledge
requirement even though "the most natural grammatical reading" of the
densely written law does not find one, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist said in a 7-2 decision. The chief justice said that when
Congress wrote the law in 1977 and amended it in 1984, it was aware of
     ((The story notes that USSC precedents have held that
     obscenity laws are unconstitutional unless they require
     proof that defendants know the nature of the material.
     Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, dissented)).

   The decision overturned a 1992 ruling by a federal appeals court in
San Francisco, which had declared the law, the Protection of Children
Against Sexual Exploitation Act, unconstitutional on its face because
it omitted a knowledge requirement.

   The statute's linguistic problem is the placement of the word
"knowingly." The law provides that anyone who "knowingly transports or
ships" or who "knowingly receives or distributes" visual depictions of
a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct has committed a federal
crime.

   Taken literally, the law requires only that the transporting,
shipping, receiving or distributing be intentional, without reference
to the sexually explicit contents or to the age of the performers.

     ((Rehnquist noted that a literal interpretation of the law
     would produce off, even absurd results)):

   Among the examples he gave of innocent violators of the law's
literal meaning was "a retail druggist who returns an uninspected roll
of developed film to a customer" and who thereby "knowingly
distributes" a "visual depiction" that might turn out to show children
engaged in sexually explicit conduct.

WHEN:     April 28-30, 1995   (Friday - Sunday)

THEMES:   The conference will explore a variety of relationships
          between law and science, including law's contribution to
          medical and ethical debates (e.g., reproduction, death and
          dying, genetics), the role of scientific and forensic
          evidence in the courtroom, environmental regulation, law
          and psychiatry, and the impact of technology on legal
          concepts and ideas of justice.  Workshops will provide an
          opportunity to discuss curriculum, teaching, and learning
          within the context of law/science perspectives.

WHO:      This is an invitational conference.  We seek a diverse
          group of about 75 faculty and other educators from the
          social sciences, humanities, and professional fields --

          psychology, mental health, criminal justice, law, medicine,
          nursing and the health sciences, etc.

COSTS:    The ABA will pay for two nights of lodging at the Hotel for
          40 invitees.  As many as 30 additional applicants will be
          invited without a lodging subsidy.  Preference for
          subsidies will be given to faculty whose interests bear
          most directly upon conference themes and who have not
          previously been subsidized at a Commission conference.  A
          $75 registration fee ($40 for commuters) includes a
          complete set of conference materials, receptions, and group
          meals.

TO APPLY: College and university faculty, deans, and organization-
          based educators wishing to apply should send a c.v. and a
          cover letter describing their interests by January 31, 1995

COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

ELIGIBILITY TEST


As you know, CPSR is an organization that is dedicated to understanding
and influencing the implications of computer technology.  We have
devised a short test below (estimated time to complete: 19.3 seconds) to
help you determine (in the privacy of your own home) whether you have
what it takes to join this effort.

If you choose the *correct* answer for all four true / false statements
below, then you are eligible to join CPSR!   It's that EASY!



    Simply answer T (for True) or False (for False) for each
    statement below.

1.  It is important for citizens to become involved in the development
    of the "Information Superhighway" to ensure that it addresses
    educational and other critical needs.

2.  Privacy considerations might be overlooked in the next-generation
    computing systems if organizations like CPSR aren't especially
    vigilant.

3.  I am concerned that the "Information Superhighway" might become an
    "Information Supertollway" - a shopping mall rather than a public
    commons.  I'm concerned about first amendment rights in cyberspace!

4.  I would like to help support Computer Professionals for Social
    Responsibility and help support the development of democratic
    and responsible technology.


[If you answered T to all four questions, you are eligible to join CPSR!]


               CPSR Isn't Just for Computer Scientists!

CPSR was started in 1981 by computer scientists and, to this day, has
many computer scientists within its ranks.   At that time, CPSR's
mission - that of informing the people as to the risks of using
computers in automated nuclear weapons systems - was quite complex.
Times have changed considerably since 1981.  Computers are much more
prevalent.  Also as computing technology becomes more an integral part
of modern life, the voice of the computer scientist - although
important - becomes one voice among many others that needs to enter
into the discussion on the future of computing technology.

While computers offer great opportunities for enhanced communication
with community and civic networks, they also offer grave threats.
Computers allow privacy violations to occur virtually unchecked
as transfer of personal information can occur almost instantaneously.
Prospects of the Clipper Chip, National ID cards, and unchecked
collecting and sharing of millions of K-12 records are looming
omininously in the future unless we act now to prevent them.

Today, in 1994, with computers playing vital roles in virtually all
areas of society, it is important that educators, students, librarians,
policy makers, engineers, social workers, activists, and business
people, among many others with important viewpoints participate in
these vital discussions.  For that reason we are currently making a
special effort to introduce all of these groups to CPSR.

Online Libel Lawsuits
=====================
ComputerWorld reports that the flame wars of the electronic frontier
have finally spilled over into the courts. Prodigy has been sued for
$200 million over a message that called a stock offering a criminal
fraud. There is speculation that Prodigy's zealous control of its
message boards, especially in terms of obscenity and topic control,
may result in the company being held to a standard higher than
services who don't so tightly monitor user activity.  The article also
discusses Kodak's policy of not allowing employees to post on
discussion groups when using a Kodak address.
(ComputerWorld. Nov. 21, 1994 pg 1+)

Sounding Off about Business Use of Internet
===========================================
Two cogent and articulate writers "sound off" about the
commercialization of the 'net in the Nov. 21, 1994 issue of
ComputerWorld. One writer is a researcher/academic, the other a
business consultant. Their arguments have been heard before, but
having both side-by-side makes for a though-provoking piece.
(ComputerWorld. Nov. 21, 1994. pg 116+)

Cyberspace and The Law reviewed
===============================
Datamation offers a short blurb about _Cyberspace and The Law: Your
Rights and Duties in the Online World_. The reviewer found it to be a
"well-written, well-organized primer meant for people who have more
experience with he Internet then with the law." The book is by Edward
Carvazos and Gavino Morin, MIT Press.

Subject: File 7--Legion of Doom "Terrorists?" (Chic Tribune summary)

((MODERATORS' Comment: File this one under "another clueless reporter
discovers the Internet." The opening paragraph says it all. We invite
comments))

           Privacy under siege in the heart of the Internet
           By Nathaniel Sheppard Jr.  Tribune Staff Writer

Source: The Chicago Tribune, Nov. 30, '94 (p. 1, 12)

WASHINGTON--They're terrorists with names such as the Legion of Doom
and Masters of Deception. But unlike the Red Guard or Symbionese
Liberation Army of a previous era, their weapon of choice is a
keyboard, not an assault rifle.

They're among the subversives launching sporadic attacks on the
information superhighway and raising troubling questions about
security and privacy for individuals, corporations and federal law
enforcement agencies.

     ((The article notes that electronic invaders compromised
     passwords, stole data, and are increasingly able to monitor
     telephone calls))

Perhaps most alarming are the attacks against Internet, a global grid
of computer networks, and the widespread distribution over the
internet of intrusion tool kits, the hacker's equivalent of the
burglar's black bag. The tool kits contain "sniffer" programs that
attach themselves to the hub of computer networks and copy user
passwords and other log-in data.

     ((The story quotes a computer security expert, Earl Boebert
     in Roseville, Minn, as saying that there's a convergence of
     traditional areas of concern--protecing individuals' personal
     data from organizations and protecting intellectual property
     from theft, and some individuals are going after organizatins
     that keep personal data records. The story notes that sniffer
     programs are used by intruders, and recent targets this year
     included Milnet)).

A Defense Department spokeswoman said intruders captured the
identification codes of about 100,000 users and were able to "steal,
alter or erase information on the affected computers and to shut
computers down or alter them in such a way as to allow further
undetected access to the compromised systems."

"Attacks on the infrastructure are becoming increasingly more
significant," said Barbara Fraser, manager of product development for
the Computer Emergency Response Team, a federally funded project based
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh that helps computer users
cope with intrusion problems.

The agency was set up in 1988 after a young hacker named Robert Morris
Jr.  introduced a "worm" into Internet, compromising an estimated
6,000 "host" or primary systems.

     ((Cert handled more than 1,300 incidents last year, the story
     says. It alludes to the MCI calling card scheme, and repeats
     the questionable facts reported by earlier media sources))

The incidents are part of a rash of attacks by underground groups of
hackers with names such as the Legion of Doom, groups made up largely
of college students.

Crackers, as the more malevolent hackers are called, have become very
sophisticated. They focus their attacks on known weaknesses in systems
or probe for back doors, said Scott Charney, director of the Justice
Department's computer crimes unit.

"Cases involving the Legion of Doom and the Masters of Deception
really went to the heart of the system," he said.

The legion is a group of about 20 hackers spread around the country.
Beginning in 1987 three members of the group in Atlanta used pilfered
passwords and old identification cards to gain access to computers at
BellSouth, the regional phone company serving southeastern states.

The three men, who subsequently pleaded guilty to computer fraud
charges, eavesdropped on telephone conversations, re-routed calls, and
are believed by authorities to have planted electronic messages in
telephone facilities in Atlanta, Denver and New Jersey that could have
knocked out 911 emergency and long distance service.

In July 1992, members of a rival group of crackers, the Masters of
Deception, allegedly broke into computers at BellSouth, TRW
Information Services, Timenet, Nynex and other data carriers and stole
credit reports and other confidential information that was sold to
private investigators.

The increase in attacks may be in part due to the proliferation of
intrusion kits, Fraser said. "Tool kits for intruding on systems are
being posted to bulletin boards all over the world," he said. "This
allows even novices to enter network systems."

     ((The article notes that electronic theft of software is also
     increasing.  It gives the exaple of TIE Fighter, based on Star
     Wars movies, that an employee made available to "software
     pirates" two weeks before the scheduled release. The article
     notes that some companies are hiring ex-hackers for security
     advice. The article also finds great significance in the "finger"
     command on Unix as a means of aiding to stalking or harassment of
     women)).
