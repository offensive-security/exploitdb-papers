New Regulations Codify PRC Internet Practice

On December 30, 1997, the Ministry of Public Security promulgated the
Regulations on the Security and Management of Computer Information Networks
and the Internet [Jisuanji Xinxi Wangluo Lianwang Anquan Baohu Guanli
Banfa]. The State Council approved these new regulations on December 11,
1997. The new regulations appear to be much more a codification of existing
practice than an important departure in the management of computer
information networks in China. The new regulations are more detailed than
the "PRC Temporary Regulations on Computer Information Network and Internet
Management" and "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Computer
Information Network and Internet Registration Information" both of February
1996 and the "Temporary Regulations on Electronic Publishing" of March 1996.
.

The new December 1997 regulations as well as earlier PRC regulations on the
Internet and electronic puiblishing are to be found in GB-encoded Chinese
text listed on the web page at <http://www.edu.cn/law>http://www.edu.cn/law

The full Chinese text of the new regulations are to be found at

regulations are translated in full
below.

This book is yet another gee-whiz look at teenage mutant wannabe-high-
tech-bandits.  The stories revolve around a number of individuals with
loose links to one particular bulletin board in Melbourne, Australia,
all engaged in system intrusions and phone phreaking.

An immediate annoyance is the insistence of the author in referring to
system breaking as "hacking."  ("Cracking" seems to be reserved for
breaking copy protection on games and other commercial software.)  If
any actual hacking takes place--creative, or otherwise sophisticated,
use of the technology--it isn't apparent in the book.  The
descriptions of activities are vague, but generally appear to be
simple "cookbook" uses of known security loopholes.  This may not
accurately reflect the events as they transpired, since the author
also betrays no depth of technical knowledge, and seems to be willing
to accept boasting as fact.  The bibliography is impressively long
until you realize that a number of the articles are never used or
referenced.  At which point, you wonder how much material has even
been read.

The structure and organization of the book is abrupt and sometimes
difficult.  Social or psychological observations are arbitrarily
plunked into the middle of descriptions of system exploration, and,
even though the paucity of dates makes it difficult to be sure, they
don't appear to be in any chronological sequence, either.  Those who
have studied in the security field will recognize some names and even
"handles," but the conceit of using only handles for members of the
"underground" makes it difficult to know how much of the material to
trust.

Early chapters foreshadow dire events to overtake "Craig Bowen" and
Stuart Gill:  Bowen never gets mentioned again, and Gill is only
mentioned twice, peripherally.  (In combination with frequent
allusions to ignorance on the part of law enforcement agencies, one
might suspect that a kind of Australian version of "The Hacker
Crackdown" [cf. BKHKCRCK.RVW] was planned, but, if so, it didn't come
off.)

The book's attitude is also oddly inconsistent.  In places, the
crackers and phreaks are lauded as brilliant, anti-establishment
heroes; but, by and large, they are portrayed as unsocialized,
paranoid, spineless non-entities, who have no life skills beyond a few
pieces of pseudo-technical knowledge used for playing vicious pranks.
So thorough is this characterization, that it comes as a total shock
to find, in the afterword, that not only do these people survive their
court convictions, but also become important contributing members of
society.

The author seems to feel quite free to point fingers in all
directions.  The absurdity of giving "look-see" intruders larger
prison sentences than thieves or spies is pointed out, but not the
difficulty of legally proving intent.  After repeatedly hinting at
police incompetence, brutality, and even corruption, the book ends
with a rather weak statement implying that the situation is getting
better.  The common cracker assertion that if sysadmins don't want
intruders, then they should secure their systems better, is followed
up with no discussion of surveys showing only one full-time security
person per five thousand employees, and only passing mention, by one
of the ex-intruders, of the extreme difficulty in doing so.  Poor
family situations are used so frequently to justify illegal activities
that one feels the need to point out that *most* products of "broken"
homes do *not* become obsessive, paranoid loner criminals!

It is interesting to see a book written about a non-US scene, and from
a non-American perspective.  Technically and journalistically,
however, it has numerous problems.

Subject: File 3--"MS Sucks...."

I take great offense when you sing the "virtues" of Microsoft because
they make a cheaper product.

How can the Windows platform be cheaper when the Federal government is
having to spend millions/billions of dollars to upgrade their computers
to overcome the year 2000 thing?

If cheaper is better, then why don't all of the restraunts close down so
that only McDonald's, Wendy's and Buger King remain.  After all, they
sell a much cheaper product than a normal restraunt.

And since we're at it, let's get rid of Mercedes, BWM, and all other
luxury cars.
Yugo and the Ford Escort are two cars that have a very attractive price.

My point is, just because a product is cheaper it doesn't mean that it
is better.
Microsoft's products are medicore at best.

|Is Microsoft Evil?
|
|Bill Gates the most productive man in the United States, is actually
|being persecuted for being productive

That's one heck of an opinion that I think many would disagree with.

|     To me, this issue should not even be discussed between
|rational people.

I've never heard of such an issue.  If both sides had points, I can't
imagine how it shouldn't be discussed.

Now, I can see some of your points, I myself am actually philosophically
close to your ideas, being *somewhat* of a laissez-faire capitalist myself.

However, I can see that you don't believe that there are such things as
unfair business practices, and you seem to think that anyone at the top
of a business *must* be providing the best products at the best prices.

To some it's easy to see that it's not the case with Microsoft, since
they are up to a *decade* behind in OS technology, yet a huge majority
of computers use their OS.  But I don't really care whether you believe
this or not, I don't see a point in starting a religious war.

But I would like to bring forward the point of 'unfair business practices.'

The world of software and hardware has two features which are enormously
different than any other business.

1)  The rate of change is incredible - approximately 2x improvement on
    all fronts every 18 months (see Moore's law or history for that).
2)  An incredible amount of inertia.  It's much harder to change hardware
    or software platforms when you decide to upgrade because your equipment
    is obsolete (as compared to say, buying a Chevy after your Ford dies).

These factors create a situation ripe for a monopoly takeover.  Whoever gets
in first can start acting in such a way to get a mojority of market share.
Then the market is stuck - and the company can act with only as much
competition as required to keep people from getting frustrated enough to
overcome point #2 above.  If you look at history, this is exactly what has
happened - with Microsoft in the world of software and another company in
terms of hardware - which I don't need to mention since it's too close the
business I work in  :)

I won't go into a list of the things that Microsoft has done to abuse
market share - just look into it's history and talk to some of the people
who are opposed to it.  Just look at it's original licensing for DOS and
Windows.  Is Bill Gates evil?  I doubt that - he is; however, a very
intelligent man who knows how to get a market and take it over, and I
would argue that the possibility that Microsoft does NOT provide the best
products at the best price.

Don't take my word - look into the history - look into how Microsoft
deals with competitors, and maybe you'll start to understand why
anti-trust legislation exists.  Unfortunately the monopoly is (imho)
the one example of how the market can't take care of itself unattended.

Subject: File 5--Contribution In response to "Is Microsoft Evil"

This laughable essay (US vs Microsoft - MRand33609@aol.com -  CUD #10.02
Sun, Jan 11, 1998)
begs an obvious question: Do the Ends justify the Means?

Sure, Microsoft has definately made some major contributions to the
computing industry, albiet it can be argued that those contributions are
wholly self-serving in the end.  But despite this, there are numerous
documented incidents where Microsoft overstepped its bounds and gained a
competitve advantage in an unethical and possibly illegal fashion.  Yes,
we're all fully aware that Microsoft didn't create the trend, but we're
also not going to go jumping off bridges because everyone else is doing it
too.

I'll agree that Microsoft has been helpful in some ways to the computing
community but that is no justification for its actions.  For all we know,
if Hitler had his way the world might have solved some of its problems -
but at what price?

Balancing methodology with results is a difficult ethical dilemna, but not
when it comes down to self-serving individuals trying to make a buck at the
expense of others.  That is, unless the most important thing to you is
money...

Privacy on the Line. The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption
by Whitfield Diffie and Susan Landau. MIT Press 1998. 342 pages.

=============================================================
        Book Review. Copyright 1998 Robert Bruen.
=============================================================

The issue of encryption use by private citizens was pushed into
the public eye after Phil Zimmerman was placed under threat of
indictment resulting from the release of Pretty Good Privacy(PGP).
The indictment threat was withdrawn and the public stopped paying
much attention to it. It was replaced by the threat of the Computer
Decency Act (CDA) as the focus of attention. Now that threat has been
pushed back, so the focus seems to be somewhat diffused. The underlying
problem has not received the attention it deserves. These two events
(and a few others) are merely instances of the most serious threat
to the American way of life since the Civil War. The threat is to
our right to privacy in our communications with one another. The right
to privacy is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution, but it
falls within the penumbra (shadow) of the rights that are explicit.

There has been a constant and continuing effort by various agencies
of the Federal Government, law enforcement and state governments to
chip away at this right. These efforts have been resisted by a number
of groups through legal challenges and media publicity. The battle is
raging, but it does not appear that most of the citizens in America
realize the extent of the consequences of this war. It is the difference
between a police state such as George Orwell envisioned in his novel 1984
(perhaps as demonstrated in East Germany and the former Soviet Union
without quite the high tech capability) and a free society as envisioned
by the framers of our Constitution.

The very future of our society is at stake, but in order to understand
just how serious the threat is, one must understand technical ideas
such as encryption, computing and networks. There are many good books
available on these topics, but they are not truly accessible to the
average citizen because the technical information is difficult and there
is not a connection to their everyday lives. Moreover the issues are
clouded by struggles over pornography and free speech.

The vacuum has been filled by Mr. Diffie and Professor Landau. He is
known as the inventor of public-key cryptography and she was primary
author of the 1994 Association of Computing Machinery report, "Codes,
Keys, and Conflicts: Issues in US Crypto Policy.'" There is no question
on their qualifications to speak on this issue.

This book is well researched with an extensive bibliography that includes
not only the expected books and articles, but also government reports, FBI
memos and Congressional testimony. This is straight-forward presentation
of just how much of a problem we all have. FBI director Louis Freeh will
not like this book, nor will the NSA, but anyone who is concerned about
their privacy and freedom will be grateful for the clear detailing of the
threat. This loss of our ability to have encrypted communication will be
an unrecoverable one. It would be the same as if the South had won the
Civil War and slavery was legal today. The major difference would be that
all of our citizens will be enslaved instead of just a particular group.
There is no other issue today that will have as much of an impact on our
future freedom as this one.

Using FBI memos, documents and testimony, the authors bring out the
fact that the FBI is willing to say just about anything to get a law
passed that makes the use of encryption by private citizens illegal.
The history of the NSA's dealings with other government agencies shows
how they have tried to control the debate and the rules concerning
encryption. These agencies have determined that encryption is of
major importance and I believe they are correct. Diffie and Landau
make this case in such a masterful manner, that you can not read the
book and not walk away with this conclusion. I think this is one of
the most important books published on privacy because it pulls together
all the relevant information in one very readable place.

The issues of cryptography, privacy, law enforcement, national security
and wiretapping are all brought together in an orderly, coherent work,
that is well written enough to be an enjoyable read that shows no signs
over-dramatization. But when you are done, the overall effect is powerful.
As an example, the value of wiretapping is often used a justification
to control the use of encryption. The authors use government reports
to demonstrate that the actual value is quite low, limited to a
few well publicized cases. In many cases the real tool was the use
of bugs, not wiretaps, which of course has little to do with encryption.
Wiretaps, new technology and the legal approach to encryption use control
are just the building blocks for the surveillance society of tomorrow.

One of the most important features of the book is the step by step
history of the attempts to pass laws by the NSA and the FBI. Quotes
are given by people like National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft
in 1991 where he refers to an attempt "...to seek a legislative fix
to the digital telephony problem" and " Success with digital
telephony will lock in one major objective; we will have established
a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix..."  This is
a clear indication that there is plan to eliminate our rights to
private communication.

I suggest that this book should be considered urgent reading and should
be widely circulated. It could be the one that wakes everybody up.

UNICEF site hacked
By Courtney Macavinta
January 8, 1998, 12:20 p.m. PT

Unknown culprits invaded the home page of the United Nation's
Children Fund (UNICEF) last night, threatening a "holocaust" if
famed hacker Kevin Mitnick is not released from prison.

The hack is reminiscent of a break-in suffered by Yahoo last
month in which, for a few moments, hackers were able to post on
the site a similar message calling for Mitnick's release. Mitnick
is in a federal penitentiary for a series of high-tech crimes.

Those who cracked UNICEF's site intertwined a jargon-filled
message with the children's rights organization's information
about the starvation and exploitation of children around the
world. They also posted photographs of women in bathing suits.
The page was titled "Starvin' for Kevin."

"Drunkz Against Madd Mothers [DAMM] and UNICEF have formed a
coalition to put an end to the mistreatment of Kevin Mitnick,"
stated the translated note. "After all, Kevin is just a big kid,
and that's what UNICEF is all about, helping the children."

If Mitnick is not released by Groundhog Day (February 2), the
hackers said, 100 children per day would be eaten by 20 "starving
super-models." The threat is even more far-fetched than the
warning posted on Yahoo.

The culprits who broke into Yahoo said the site's recent visitors
had been infected with "logic bomb/worm" that would detonate on
Christmas Day, "wreaking havoc upon the entire planet's
networks." The bomb never went off--which was no surprise to
computer experts.

But the UNICEF site's security was compromised much longer than
that of Yahoo, as the nonprofit organization can't monitor its
site around the clock. Some Net users told NEWS.COM they stumbled
upon the hack last night. The organization said today that it
discovered the altered home page around 4 a.m., and fully
restored the site by 8:30 a.m. today.

 For Immediate Release

 EFF Announces Appointment of Barry Steinhardt as President and CEO, and
 Election of Lori Fena as Chairman

 SAN FRANCISCO, January 12, 1998 -- The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
 today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Barry Steinhardt
 to President and Chief Executive Officer. Steinhardt is currently the
 Associate Director of the American Civil Liberties Union. The appointment
 was made at an EFF Board meeting held today in San Francisco.

 He replaces Lori Fena, who has been elected Chairman of the Board of EFF.
 Resigning Chairman Esther Dyson remains an active, enthusiastic member of
 the Board.

 "We are very pleased to appoint Barry Steinhardt as our new President," said
 Esther Dyson, former Chairman of the EFF Board of Directors. "Steinhardt has
 a wealth of experience with both our issues and the operation of non-profit
 organizations."

 "Barry's background is exactly what we were looking for," Dyson continued.
 "We expect him to be able to help us continue to build EFF as a premier
 organization that can take on the daunting challenge of defending and
 defining civil liberties and structures to protect them in the electronic
 world."

 As Associate Director of the ACLU, Steinhardt formed and chaired its Cyber-
 liberties Task Force, which coordinates the ACLU's extensive program on
 information technology issues. He was a co-founder of the Global Internet
 Liberty Campaign (GILC), the world's first international coalition of on-
 line rights groups and one of the originators of the Internet Free
 Expression Alliance (IFEA), which was recently formed to monitor issues
 related to Internet content rating and filtering. Steinhardt has spoken and
 written widely on cyber-liberties issues.

 Most recently he was the co-author of  "Fahrenheit 451.2 - Is Cyberspace
 Burning?", the ACLU White paper on Internet content rating and blocking. He
 is currently at work on the ACLU handbook on "The Rights of Persons
 On-line."

 In addition to his cyber-liberties work, Steinhardt has coordinated the ACLU
 policy development process and efforts to strengthen structure and
 management of the ACLU's 53 state affiliates. He has been with the ACLU for
 17 years and previously served as Executive Director of its Pennsylvania and
 Vermont affiliates.

 "This is a tremendous opportunity for Barry, who has shown talent and
 imagination in the cyber-liberties arena," said ACLU Executive Director Ira
 Glasser.  "It is also an opportunity for the ACLU to work even more closely
 than we have with EFF on many issues where we share common goals  and
 values."

 Steinhardt succeeds outgoing EFF Executive Director Lori Fena, who will
 become Chairman of EFF's Board of Directors, and will resume her career in
 private industry as a venture investment advisor and consultant.


 "Lori Fena has done a superb job of building EFF over the past two years,"
 Dyson said. "She demonstrated great vision in her stewardship of TRUSTe and
 a host of other projects and is an excellent choice as incoming Chairman.
 The Board of Directors is very grateful for her leadership and looks forward
 to working with Lori in her new capacity," Dyson concluded.

 EFF appointment

 Fena noted that EFF and ACLU have a long history of cooperative action that
 has ranged from the successful challenge to the Communications Decency Act
 in the 1997 Supreme Court decision in Reno v. ACLU, to ongoing efforts to
 promote the privacy of communications through the use of strong encryption.

 Most recently, the two organizations joined together to support
 legislation to remove the restrictions on the use of encryption.  They also
 have cooperated in Bernstein v. Department of State, in which EFF is
 challenging the constitutionality of the US Government's restrictions on the
 export of encryption technology. Fena further noted that EFF and ACLU have
 been regular coalition partners, including common membership in the GILC and
 IFEA coalitions.

 "Hiring Barry is a natural step for EFF," Fena said. "It will strengthen the
 bond between two dedicated civil liberties organizations. We expect the two
 groups to work together even more closely to leverage our respective
 strengths to protect free speech and privacy in the information age."

 Steinhardt said he is "grateful for the opportunity to play a leadership
 role in the next phase of EFF's development."

 "EFF was the pioneer defender of the rights of on-line users," he continued.
 "With the explosive growth of the Internet and other information
 technologies, the need for a strong and vibrant EFF is greater
 than ever."

 Steinhardt said that he expected to concentrate his efforts on expanding
 EFF's membership and financial resources, maximizing EFF's already strong
 public presence, organizing grassroots support for cyber rights, enlarging
 EFF's role in the global movement for on-line rights and providing support
 for EFF's pioneering work to adapt traditional concepts of civil liberties
 for new mediums.

 Steinhardt will formally assume his new role on February 2.

 civil liberties organization working in the public interest to promote
 privacy, free expression, and social responsibility in new media.
