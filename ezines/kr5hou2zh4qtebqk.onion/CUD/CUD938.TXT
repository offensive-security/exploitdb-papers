Maxwell's "How to Access the Federal Government on the Internet"
(cf.  BKHAFGOI.RVW) tells what your (US) government can do for
you.  Casey's "The Hill on the Net" (cf. BKHILNET.RVW) is a kind
of personal memoir of exploration of the use of technology among
politicians.  Browning here provides the basics, background and
case studies for grassroots use of the net to affect and influence
the political process.

The first three chapters contain anecdotal accounts of specific
political events that have been influenced by net-based
activities.  This is readable, interesting, and even informative,
but many similar works go no further.  Browning proceeds to advise
on acceptable tactics on the net, as well as the potential
downside to political use of the Internet.  There is a brief look
at some related technologies, and a set of resources (which the
author admits are personally selected and not exhaustive).

A realistic, useful, and balanced guide.

The Editor
*The Boston Globe*
POB 2378
Boston MA 02107-2378

Dear Editor:

Words cannot express my horror on picking up the *Boston
Globe* on May 6 to discover that -- using a few sentences
from a 14,000 word essay ("The Limits to Free Expression and
the Problem of Child Pornography"), ripped out of context to
distort their meaning -- the *Globe* portrayed me as an
advocate for sex between adults and children.  The essay
(whose focus is freedom of expression) has been sitting
quietly on my web site for the past two years and has never
heretofore provoked controversy.

While it is appalling that such treatment be accorded any
writer, it is especially troubling when the target of the
smear happens to be gay.  If we sexual-minority writers are
courageous enough not to self-censor, our writings become
especially vulnerable to malicious distortion -- especially
if we venture too far outside our ghettoes.

Cullen and Armstrong make the unsubstantiated statement that
I have "argued against laws that establish an arbitrary age
at which sex between adults and minors is legal."  I do this
nowhere in the cited essay or elsewhere.  I had a long
discussion with David Armstrong about age-of-consent laws
when I returned his phone call late on May 5.  While I
pointed out serious problems with these laws, I also
mentioned valid functions they might serve.  I told
Armstrong that I didn't have a well thought out position on
age-of-consent laws because they are not, and have never
been, one of my core concerns.

I tackled the issue of child pornography in my essay because
it is *the* most difficult free-speech issue, and one that
most activists duck.  One reason the issue is important is
that all sorts of materials -- important works of art,
innocent family photos -- now get conflated with child
pornography.  What makes the issue very difficult is that
people compound legitimate concerns about protecting
children with the illegitimate goal of suppressing ideas
(including heinous ideas).  Even unabashed child pornography
contains ideas.  (So does Nazi propaganda.)  This doesn't
mean I believe the ideas are good or that I agree with them.
I might, for example, have said: "In Nazi propaganda, Jews
are always portrayed as the cause of all of the world's
problem.  This is the idea that people wish to suppress."
Such a remark could as easily be ripped out of context by
someone wishing to portray me as an anti-Semite.

The article states, "Chatelle praises the controversial
group NAMBLA...because the group advocates for consensual
sex between men and boys."  This is quite simply a lie,
unsupported by anything I have ever said or written.

Had Cullen and Armstrong done their homework, they would
have discovered that I am a nationally reputable advocate
for freedom of expression.  [Ironically, late in 1995 when
Mr. Cullen was writing about a restrictive speech code
proposed for the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, I
was one of the people he interviewed.]  I've been among the
very few anti-censorship activists who have defended NAMBLA
members' free-speech rights.  I doubt very much that Cullen
and Armstrong have interviewed NAMBLA spokespeople or read
NAMBLA literature, but I have.  Much of it -- and I never
said *all* -- *is* "thoughtful, clearly reasoned, and
provocative."  So are most of the writings of William F.
Buckley.  That doesn't mean I agree with them.

According to NAMBLA's literature, they advocate changing
laws but never advise anyone to break them and also advise
members of the dire consequences should they do so.  Because
of this, because they do emphasize the necessity of consent,
and because pathology breeds in isolation, I don't think
it's all that outrageous to suggest that the organization
has prevented some sexual abuse.

I have not responded until now because this week has been
very emotionally difficult.  Your article has robbed me of
friends of many years standing.  You may have impaired my
ability to earn a living.  And the damage to my good name
can never be repaired.  Moreover, because I recently brought
to public attention what I consider a serious ethical breach
on the part of a *Globe* employee, I have reason to believe
I was maliciously smeared in retaliation.  Many people are
urging me to sue for libel and/or intentional infliction of
emotional distress.

I have made no final decision regarding legal action.
Although the *Globe* has robbed me of friends, my
reputation, and perhaps my ability to support myself, it has
not taken away those things I value most: my truest friends,
my 27-year partnership with Jim D'Entremont, my sobriety,
and my principles.  I have established myself as a
principled defender of freedom of expression, and I promise
that those principles will in no way be compromised by
whatever action I may take against the Boston *Globe*.


Sincerely,

Robert B. Chatelle

Subject: File 3--Ethical Spectacle Mirrors Banned Canadian Site

THE ETHICAL SPECTACLE MIRRORS BANNED CANADIAN WEB PAGE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 16, 1997

The Ethical Spectacle (http://www.spectacle.org) a US publication,
has posted a copy of an anonymous Canadian Green Party campaign
document which was forced off the World Wide Web by Canadian
elections officials under a law banning anonymity in election
campaigns.  The document is available at
http://www.spectacle.org/alert/green.html.

The Spectacle is a monthly ezine, published only on the World Wide
Web, covering the intersection or collision of ethics, law and
politics in our society. It averages about 30,000 readers monthly
and regularly covers free speech issues.  It is published by
Jonathan Wallace, a businessman, attorney
 and author residing in New York City, and is hosted on a server in
the  state of New Jersey.

"I mirrored the Green Party document to illustrate the futility of
the Canadian law," Wallace said. "The issue of anonymity in
election campaigns was settled in the US in 1995, in a Supreme
Court case called McIntyre v. Ohio. Mrs. McIntyre distributed
anonymous leaflets criticizing the local school board and was fined
$100. The court held that anonymity promotes diversity of political
discourse.  There is no difference between Mrs. McIntyre's leaflet
and the Green Party Web page."

While acknowledging that US laws and the First Amendment do not
apply in Canada, Wallace pointed out that the converse is also
true. "I have a right under US law to post the document, where it
is easily available to Canadian readers. This illustrates that
local laws banning anonymity or particular forms of speech are
increasingly futile in the age of the World Wide Web."

Electronic Frontiers Canada is considering legal action in Canada
to test the government's action against the anonymous poster of the
Web page. Ten other mirrors of the Green Party document have been
posted in the US and other countries at EFC's request.  For more
information, see http://www.efc.ca.

Wallace is the co-author of Sex, Laws and Cyberspace (Henry Holt,
1996), a book on Internet censorship
(http://www.spectacle.org/freespch/), and was a plaintiff in ACLU
v. Reno, the case which held the Communications Decency Act
unconstitutional (http://www.spectacle.org/cda/cdamn.html).

Subject: File 5--INTERPORT STRIVES TO HELP THOSE THAT HELP OTHERS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

INTERPORT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THE ASSOCIATION TO BENEFIT
CHILDREN'S WEB SITE   Interport strives to help those that help others

Interport Communications, the leading regional Internet Service
Provider in New York City, is proud to be sponsoring the
Association to Benefit Children web site (http://www.a-b-c.org).
"We understand that non-profit organizations certainly need to
receive as much exposure as possible in their constant pursuit
for funding and volunteers, and what better way to get your name
out there than the Internet. Since our inception three years ago
we have been very interested in supporting non-profit
organizations," states Emanuel Kwahk, president and co-founder of
Interport, "especially by offering creative payment plans and
reduced fees for web site hosting."

The Association to Benefit Children was founded in 1986 to fight
against the numerous threats children face every day: poverty,
homelessness, drug addiction and HIV. ABC has started and is
currently maintaining several programs for children in the areas
of education, health, housing, and employment. In order to keep
these programs running smoothly ABC depends on donations and
volunteers, and uses the Web to get local, national, and even
world-wide exposure.  "The Association To Benefit Children has
had a wonderful experience with Interport. We now have a
prominent presence on the Internet, comparable to what a major
corporation has. Through a mutual relationship, benefiting both
parties, Interport has unleashed the power of the Internet for
our organization," states Sam Charap of ABC.

The Association to Benefit Children has set up their Web Site to
provide information about the various  programs they sponsor, to
find and sign up volunteers, and to have purchases made over the
Internet. One of their most well known projects, Baked in the
Hood, is an East Harlem bakery that is run by parents of homeless
families. This very successful program gives the homeless an
opportunity to learn job skills and to get work experience in
baking, merchandising, and delivery. These gourmet baked goods
are delivered all over the city, and you can even purchase a wide
assortment of tarts, cakes, cookies and truffles online. Another
program, the Variety Cody Gifford House for Children is a medical
foster care program for placement of homeless children with
handicaps and medical problems. One can find out about these and
other programs they run by visiting their web site, and can
request a copy of their annual report.

Interport works with several other non-profit organizations
including St. John the Divine Cathedral, the Art Director's Club,
KidS' Space Organization, Amnesty International Publications,
MOMA, UNICEF and Trinity Church.

About Interport:

Founded in 1994 to provide Internet connectivity to New York
City, Interport has thrived by offering superior customer
service, robust technology and comprehensive business services.
It has more than 40 employees who work out of the company's
Flatiron District offices. Interport was recently named "The Best
Regional Internet Provider" in the Wall Street Journal's Smart
Money magazine. They were also voted the best provider in New
York by New York Magazine. While Interport has achieved its
greatest recognition as the leading Metro New York Internet
access provider, a significant portion of its business comes from
the special services it offers businesses, non-profit
organizations, government and educational institutions.

Interport corporate clients include: U.S. Navy, BBDO Advertising,
Butterball Turkey, Bacardi International Limited, CBS News,
Edelman Public Relations, Frito-Lay, Hearst Publications,
MetLife, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Radio City Music Hall,
Miramax Films, New York Yankees, Sothebys and Amnesty
International Publications.

Subject: File 6--Why SUNY-Binghamton should stop censoring "mirrors"

Source -  fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

This is a new FAQ I've written for the Computers and Academic
Freedom Archive. It will live at
 http://www.eff.org/CAF/faq/outside-content.html.
Comments welcome.

===============
=============== ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/faq/outside-content ===============
q: Should a university ban outside content from student web pages?

a: No. For both legal and academic freedom reasons, it is unwise and
perhaps illegal to censor outside material from student web pages.

In this article, I first look at the legal issues, then I discusses
the academic freedom issues.I look at the history of this issue first
on the computer and then going back to McCarthy Era bans on outside
speakers.

[Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer.]

Legally and academically, there is nothing wrong (in general) with a
student putting up web material that someone else writes. I'm sure
there are hundreds of student Shakespeare sites. They key is that the
material is there at the pleasure of the student and that he or she
could remove it anytime he or she wants.

By analogy, the editor of a typical student newspaper doesn't write
every word that appears in the paper, but all the articles appear at
his or here pleasure.

I only see problems if

   1. The student is paid to put the material up. This would violate
      typical rules against selling university services or property
      without authorization.
   2. The student gave out his or here account and password. This
      would violate typical rules against password sharing.
   3. If the material is censored by law (e.g. something a local court
      has found to be obscene).

The legal framework for this issue is the Supreme Court's Public Forum
Doctrine. Among other things, its says that content-based prohibition
must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest. For
example, viewpoint-based discrimination is forbidden.

The references include information about the public forum doctrine
and on what letting student exercise free expression helps the University
mission.

Academically, outside material is important and legitimate. If I was
still student, a university ban on outside HTML pages would have
banned my Computers and Academic Freedom Web site. Why? Because my web
site contains an archive of university policies. I don't reformat
these. Why do I copy instead of just linking?

       1. It enables searches across my collection
       2. When a university changes their policy, it allows
            a word-for-word comparison between my version and
            the new version to see what was changed.

I believe such archiving is very much in keeping with academic principles.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle article and personal
communications with the Chronicle reporter, SUNY-Binghamton allows
outside text, but not full HTML pages.

I believe that censorship of outside-created web pages is a return to
McCarthy Era bans on outside speakers.

Historically, I think SUNY-Binghamton has reinvented a censorship
trick that I thought at died in with the McCarthy Era. In those days,
Universities used arbitrary rules to restrict unpopular speakers from
off-campus.

At the U. of Illinois (my alma mater), for example, in 1958, an
administrative order of the President set down rules for visiting
speakers. The rules are prefaced with this:

       The University of Illinois Statutes (Section 39a) state, "It is
    the policy of the University to maintain and encourage full freedom
    within the law, of inquiry, discourse, teaching, research, and
    publication ..." Consistent with this policy the Senate Committee on
    Visiting Speakers will maintain the tradition of full freedom of
    discourse for visiting speakers within the limitations imposed by
    law, rules of the Board of Trustees, University regulations, and the
    welfare of the University.

With classic doublethink, it then prohibited full discourse:

       1. Subversive Organizations. The Illinois Statutes provide [...]:
    No Trustee, official, instructor, or other employee of the University
    of Illinois shall extend to any subversive, seditious, and un-American
    organization, or to its representatives, the use of any facilities of
    the University for the purpose of carrying on, advertising, or
    publicizing the activities of such organization."

It also required that student organizations get approval before
having in a visiting speaker.

In 1961, the Trustees added this to the rules on visiting speakers:

       2. Political Speakers. University building and grounds shall not be
    used for political purposes except for candidates for nomination or
    election to state-wide or national offices may appear in person to
    make political address.

At the U. of Illinois and most other state universities, everything
changed around 1971. At U. of Illinois the Chancellor approved the
Statement on Individual Rights. It said in part:

     A. Discussion and expression of all views is permitted within the
    University subject only to requirements for the maintenance of order.
      [...]
     B. Members and organizations in the University community may invite
    and hear any persons of their own choosing, subject only to reasonable
    requirements on time, place, and manner for use of University
    facilities.

These policies were generally modeled on "Joint Statement on Rights
and Freedoms of Students", the statement of academic freedom for U.S.
students. It was written in 1967 and has been endorsed by dozens of
academic organizations. It says:

      2. Students should be allowed to invite and to hear any person
    of their own choosing. Those routine procedures required by an
    institution before a guest speaker is invited to appear on campus
    should be designed only to insure that there is orderly scheduling
    of facilities and adequate preparation for the event, and that the
    occasion is conducted in a manner appropriate to an academic
    community. The institutional control of campus facilities should
    not be used as a device of censorship. It should be made clear to
    the academic and larger community that sponsorship of guest
    speakers does not necessarily imply approval or endorsement of the
    views expressed, either by the sponsoring group or the
    institution.
         == From ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/academic/student.freedoms.aaup

I suspect that SUNY-Binghamton does not even realize that it is
falling back into the old patterns of university censorship. I hope it
will reconsider its policy and I hope other universities will think
careful and repeat history.

Rebels Find Haven on U.S. Web Sites
State universities give space to Peru, Colombia groups
Robert Collier, Chronicle Staff Writer

As the U.S. government fights international terrorism, some rebel groups
have found a safe niche at American taxpayer expense -- in state
university Web sites.
[...]
``This is just another example of dangerous material being tolerated on
the Internet,'' said Monique Nelson, West Coast spokeswoman for Enough
Is Enough[...]
[...]

When first asked about the FARC site by The Chronicle, [State
University of New York at] Binghamton spokeswoman Anita Doll said the
university was unaware of it. Then this week, she said that the school
administration had decided that the site was ``totally unacceptable''
and should be shut down.
[...]
Internet free-speech activists sharply criticized the Binghamton
decision. ``This is a return to McCarthy-era censorship,'' said Carl
Kadie, president of Computers in Academic Freedom, a Seattle group,
adding that the ban ``is almost certainly illegal, and I'm sure it
wouldn't survive a court challenge.''
