GPO PUTS CONGRESSIONAL BILLS ONLINE                                             
                                                                                
     The U.S Government Printing Office (GPO) now has all                       
Congressional Bills available online.  The Congressional Bills                  
database contains all published versions of House and Senate bills              
introduced since the start of the 103d Congress.                                
                                                                                
     The Congressional Bills database joins the official Government             
versions of the Congressional Record and the Federal Register that              
have been offered in electronic format over the Internet through the            
GPO Access service since June 1994.                                             
                                                                                
     The Bills database is updated by 6 a.m. each day bills are                 
published.  Bills are available as ASCII text files and in Adobe                
Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) file format.  Users with                 
Acrobat viewers will be able to display and print typeset page                  
facsimiles.                                                                     
                                                                                
     The Federal Register and the Congressional Record are available            
online by 6 a.m. and by 11 a.m. e.s.t. daily, respectively.  Documents          
in the Register and Record databases are available as ASCII text files          
with all graphics in TIFF file format.                                          
                                                                                
     Organizations or individuals may subscribe directly from GPO for           
each of the three databases for $35 per month, $200 for 6 months, or            
$375 for 1 year for a single workstation.  Special 2rates are                   
available for multiple workstations.                                            
                                                                                
     Information about how to subscribe to the Congressional Bills,             
Record, or Register databases is available by calling GPO at                    
202-512-1530 or by fax at 202-512-1262.  Internet E-mail should be              
sent to help@eids05.eids.gpo.gov.                                               
                                                                                
     Users with full Internet access and local WAIS client software             
will be able to receive both ASCII text and all graphics as individual          
TIFF files or PDF files in the Congressional Record, Congressional              
Bills, and Federal Register databases.  This is the first time that             
both text and graphics have been made available electronically via an           
online service.  GPO's customized WAIS client software, a                       
user-interface program specifically designed for GPO's application, is          
available from GPO for $15.                                                     
                                                                                
     Those who do not have full Internet connections can access ASCII           
text files, but not the PDF files or graphics, by using a phone modem           
to dial directly into GPO without additional software.  These                   
subscriptions provide for unlimited use for a stand alone workstation           
or an individual SWAIS user ID.                                                 
                                                                                
     The Congressional Bills and the Record and Register databases are          
also available for free electronic searches to walk-in patrons of many          
of the Nation's 1,400 depository libraries under a "GPO Access"                 
program authorized by law and launched in June 1994.  The Depository            
Library System includes academic, public, law, and Federal libraries.           
There is at least one Federal depository library in every                       
Congressional district.                                                         
                                                                                
     The Superintendent of Documents is the official source for the             
sale of information published by more than 100 Federal agencies.                
Approximately 12,000 books or documents, 600 periodicals, and a                 
growing number of CD-ROMS, diskettes, and online services are                   
available.

Subject: File 2--A Summary of Electronic Gov't Info for California              
                                                                                
The California Senate is undoubtedly the most advanced legislature in           
the United States in the range of services it provides to                       
Internet-connected users.  I've seen a number of fragmented messages            
come out over a variety of lists and thought people might be interested         
in seeing the whole breadth of services they offer.  Using the services         
at this site, you can correspond with Senators and their staffs, find           
out about pending legislation, subscribe to information services                
(including the capability to follow a bill), do full-text searches on           
legislative information and more.                                               
                                                                                
1) Incoming Email.                                                              
                                                                                
All Senate staffers and Senators are on an internal email system.  For          
those people to receive email, they have to complete a simple enrollment        
process; most folks have done that.  You can try and guess someone's            
name by using this formula: First.Last@SEN.CA.GOV.  For example, if you         
wanted to send to Linda Ronstadt, you would send to                             
Linda.Ronstadt@SEN.CA.GOV.                                                      
                                                                                
2) Directory Services.                                                          
                                                                                
You can look up email addresses by using the white pages server they've         
set up.  NOTE: Every user has the option of NOT being listed in this            
server!  To get to the server, you can:                                         
                                                                                
        - use your finger command @sen.ca.gov                                          
        - send mail to finger@sen.ca.gov                                               
        - use your WWW browser to www.sen.ca.gov                                       
                                                                                
The server accepts the usual sort of fuzzy strings you'd expect a good          
server to handle, as well as the following special cases:                       
                                                                                
        - "help"  (finger help@sen.ca.gov)                                             
        - "senator" - gives you a list of real live senators who                       
                want to receive email addressed to them directly                              
                (as opposed to their staff members)                                           
                                                                                
3) Senator Information Files                                                    
                                                                                
If you don't know who your senator is, you can always look it up by             
FINGERing your ZIP code.  For example, if you lived in Beverly Hills,           
you could:                                                                      
                                                                                
        finger 90210@sen.ca.gov                                                        
                                                                                
to see who your Senator is.                                                     
                                                                                
This server also returns lots of information about each Senator,                
including addresses, biography, committees, etc.                                
                                                                                
4) FTP Server                                                                   
                                                                                
An FTP server (at FTP.SEN.CA.GOV) is available with information on the          
Senate, Senators, and various senate committees and offices (including          
the Senate Office of Research, which does a lot of cool reports).               
                                                                                
5) Gopher Server                                                                
                                                                                
The Gopher server (at Gopher.SEN.CA.GOV) lets you access everything on          
the FTP server plus the entire California code and statutes and                 
constitution, all pending Bills before the legislature, and other Senate        
and Legislative information.  This server maintains the most                    
comprehensive set of links to other State legislatures available in             
GopherSpace.  You can also do full-text searches of the pending bill            
files to find bills which might be of interest to you.                          
                                                                                
6) Senate News service (and mail server)                                        
                                                                                
Senate News is a mail-based service which lets you subscribe to topics          
of interest (such as bulletins from senators, committee reports, etc)           
and be emailed information (or simply notifications about information)          
whenever the system changes.  You can also use the mail server to do            
bill topic searches and to retrieve bill files.  Send an email message          
to senate-news@sen.ca.gov with a text of "help" to get the help file for        
this.                                                                           
                                                                                
A new service in Senate News lets you follow a bill as it passes through        
the legislature.  Once you've identified a bill you're interested in,           
you can subscribe to it (through senate-news) and anytime the bill              
changes, is analyzed, or has a status change (e.g., voting, vetoes,             
etc), you'll get mailed the changes (or a notification of the changes).         
                                                                                
7) WWW Server                                                                   
                                                                                
The WWW server (at WWW.SEN.CA.GOV) is a new service which lets you do           
full text searches of bills pending before the legislature, access all          
the information available in the Gopher server, and other tasks (such as        
white pages lookups).  This is slowly being expanded.                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
There are other services available to internal users, such as a full USENET     
news feed and Clarinet news service, but these are not available to             
external users.                                                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS: I speak in no way, shape, or form for the California     
Senate Rules Committee.  They reserve the right to call me a lyin' bastard      
anytime they want.  None of this represents a commitment to continue            
service from that site.  SEN.CA.GOV site does not operate to satisfy the        
requirements of any law or budget item.  If you want to see what AB 1624        
requires, FTP to leginfo.public.ca.gov. If you want this project to be          
continued, call your Senator and tell him or her how cool you think             
SEN.CA.GOV is!                                                                  
                                                                                
If you want any advice on the technology or tools used to implement this        
service, I'd be happy to talk to you about it (since I did most of the          
implementation).  If you want to congratulate the person who thought this       
up, got the funding, ran the political hurdles, and continues to do the         
real hard work,  write to Dennis.Miller@SEN.CA.GOV (or call the pro tem in      
charge of Senate Rules, Senator Bill Lockyer at 916-445-6671 or c/o State       
Capitol Rm. 205, Sacto, 95814).  If you have questions about the                
legislative process or want to know something about a bill or whatever ...      
we don't have anyone to answer those questions; call your Senator (see (2)

((MODERATORS' NOTE: The following article first appeared in the Los

Los Angeles--"Agent Steal" was captured last week in Westwood, but              
computer crime cop Scott Charney knows cyberspace is crawling with              
other criminals and spies, some more dangerous.                                 
                                                                                
   "The threat is an increasing threat," said Charney, chief of the             
computer crime unit for the U.S. Department of Justice. "It could be a          
16-year old kid out for fun -- or it could be someone who is actively           
working to get information from the United States."                             
                                                                                
   "Agent Steal," the computer alias for Justin Tanner Peterson,                
belongs to the growing new breed of digital outlaws who threaten                
national security and public safety, Charney said.                              
                                                                                
   In Los Angeles alone, Peterson is one of at least four outlaw                
computer hackers who in recent years have demonstrated they can seize           
control of telephones and break into government computers.                      
                                                                                
   "We are out of the realm of the theoretical," Charney said.                  
                                                                                
FOREIGN OPERATIVES' HACKING                                                     
                                                                                
   Government reports further reveal that foreign intelligence                  
agencies and mercenary computer hackers have been sneaking through              
telephone lines into military and commercial computers.                         
                                                                                
   In Petersen's case, he pleaded guilty to cracking credit bureau              
telephones and computers for get-rich schemes. But FBI agents say they          
believe he also broke into a computer used to conduct legal wiretaps.           
                                                                                
   During a telephone interview several weeks before his arrest,                
Petersen alluded to the destruction that hackers like himself can               
cause with a few keystrokes.                                                    
                                                                                
   "I wouldn't want the powers I have to be in the wrong hands                  
--someone with malicious intentions," he said.                                  
                                                                                
   Top government officials say it is too late.                                 
                                                                                
   Former North Hollywood resident Kevin Lee Poulsen -- known as the            
"Dark Dante" -- is awaiting trial in San Francisco on espionage                 
charges for cracking an Army computer and snooping into an FBI                  
investigation of former Phillipines President Ferdinand Marcos.                 
                                                                                
   The cases of Poulsen, Petersen and others illustrate how the                 
stereotypical hacker driven by intellectual challenge and curiosity             
is now being replaced by technically sophisticated criminals driven by          
greed.                                                                          
                                                                                
A TERRORIST WEAPON?                                                             
                                                                                
   "The nature of this changing motivation makes computer intruders'            
skills high-interest targets for criminal elements and hostile                  
adversaries," according to a publicly released version of a Department          
of Defense report, "An Awareness Document."                                     
                                                                                
   Hired by terrorists, these hackers could cripple the country's               
telephone system, "create significant public health and safety                  
problems, and cause serious economic shocks," the September 1993                
Pentagon report adds.                                                           
                                                                                
   Further, as the world becomes wired for computer networks, the               
report says there is a greater threat the networks will be used for             
spying and terrorism.                                                           
                                                                                
   "At least one foreign intelligence service is believed to be                 
actively engaged in the collection of intelligence through computer             
intrusion," the report says, but does not identify the service.                 
                                                                                
EXTENT OF THREAT QUESTIONED                                                     
                                                                                
   Some argue the hacker danger is overstated, and that the nation's            
telephone system is in more jeopardy from drunken drivers who take out          
utility poles or someone who breaks into a switching station.                   
                                                                                
   They say perhaps a greater risk lies in government agencies                  
exaggerating the hacker problem to justify the creation of overly               
restrictive laws.                                                               
                                                                                
   "Of course there are people who can screw up the networks, and               
people who will sell themselves for a packet of comic books --but I             
think (the government) greatly overstate the threat," said Northern             
Illinois University criminologist Jim Thomas.                                   
                                                                                
   "Where I see the danger is when the goals become hysteria, and the           
answer, I would argue, is not tighter laws but educating the public             
that there are some dangers," Thomas said.                                      
                                                                                
   But the government reports give more weight to the potential for             
destruction.                                                                    
                                                                                
   The President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory                
Committee warned in a 1992 report that "known individuals in the hacker         
community have ties with adversary organizations. Hackers frequently            
have international ties."                                                       
                                                                                
   They include some members of the Chaos Computer Club in Germany,             
who the Pentagon report says have demonstrated their willingness to             
work with foreign governments.                                                  
                                                                                
   The Chaos Computer Club is believed to have cracked a National               
Aeronautics and Space Administration computer and supplied the Soviet           
Union's KGB with information obtained from Western military systems,            
the                                                                             
                                                                                
   Nationwide, telephone companies and government agencies are                  
designing new ways to defend against hackers and track down criminals           
who do breach the networks.                                                     
                                                                                
   The FBI recently opened its second computer crime unit in San Jose.          
And the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., is adding two more           
computer crime specialists to its staff of four, to guide local                 
federal prosecutors in the war on digital crime.                                
                                                                                
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said the battle with hackers           
is never ending, but with each attack, the company learns and                   
strengthens the system.                                                         
                                                                                
   "It is a big house, and we close as many doors as we can, and                
new doors will open and we will close those," Bonniksen said.

Subject: File 4--Response to LA Daily News Article                              
                                                                                
A few weeks ago, I was contacted by Keith Stone, a reporter for the LA          
Daily News. Stone was writing a story on the potential of "hackers" to          
threaten national security through spying or espionage activities.  It          
was clear that Stone intended to push the angle of the threat, because          
both his questions and his recalcitrance in having some of his                  
erroneous factual and conceptual errors challenged suggested that he            
preferred drama to accuracy.                                                    
                                                                                
Stone seemed to be over-inclined to seek out those facts that                   
corroborated his view of dangerous hackers lurking amongst us, and              
less inclined to accept opposing views. For example, he seemed                  
convinced that the Legion of Doom was plotting circa 1989-1990 to               
bring down the nation's E-911 system.  A law enforcement agent, he              
said, told him so. He insisted on arguing the point, and seemed                 
impervious to suggestions that either he check his facts or his                 
sources.                                                                        
                                                                                
Here's why we object to Stone's story and others like it that                   
sensationalize the dangers of "computer hackers."  State and federal            
legislators are gradually introducing legislation based on an                   
exaggerated threat of computer technology. The Digital Telephony (FBI           
Wiretap) Bill (HR 4922) is but one example of how the fear of                   
technologically sophisticated criminals generates hyperbole to justify          
laws and policies that some critics argue reduces Constitutional                
protections in cyberspace.  We have also noted in past issues of CuD            
that such hyperbole finds it way into exaggerated indictments and               
other documents in criminal proceedings.  Such stories, we judge,               
irresponsibly contribute to bad law and judicial injustice.                     
                                                                                
We also object to such stories because they are simply poor reporting.          
Most of the U.S. population has little experience with cyberspace and           
the computer culture. When the public obtains its images of cyberspace          
from the whatever "Threat of the Month Club" is current, communicating          
the benefits (and *legitimate* dangers) of computer technology becomes          
more difficult. Whether addressing the dangers of files on anarchy and          
explosives, graphic sexual images, pedophilia, hackers, pirates, or             
similar topics, most media reflect a tendency toward misrepresenting            
the character of participants and inflating the threat to the public.           
Although some stories, such as Stone's, often contain an obligatory             
dissenting quote, the thrust of the stories remains unbalanced.  It is          
not that such stories do not conform to some ideal image we'd like to           
see, but that they consistently conform to an image that seems "sexy"           
or that corresponds more closely to law enforcement views than any              
accurate reflection of the topic. More simply, such stories deceive             
the reader.                                                                     
                                                                                
What, specifically, do we object to in the Stone story?                         
                                                                                
First, the story exaggerates the exploits of such "hackers" as "Agent           
Steal" and Kevin Poulsen. There is no evidence we have seen that                
either posed any significant threat to U.S. security or public safety.          
Nor does Stone report the contents of the indictments, but relies               
instead on the self-serving summary of law enforcement personnel. In            
fact, one Bay Area reporter chided Stone in print for making a                  
fundamental error in reporting the charges against Poulsen as pending,          
which were dropped (the story will be excerpted in next week's CuD).            
In short, Stone typifies that breed of reporters who know little about          
the issues underlying many of these cases, and seems to use them                
instead as a convenient hook to spin a yarn of their own.                       
                                                                                
Second, Stone, like some other reporters, raises the spectre of the             
"hacker as spy." There has been no evidence that either Poulsen or              
"Agent Steal" were involved in espionage, despite the easy transition           
Stone makes between it and hacking. It would hardly be a surprise if            
computer-wise techies found that espionage pays. No news there.  If             
phone technicians, CIA insiders, and journalists sell their integrity           
along with their expertise, where's the story when somebody else does           
it? The story actually would seem that--as far as is publicly                   
known--this hasn't yet occurred in the U.S.                                     
                                                                                
Notice how easily Stone's prose slides through innuendo:                        
                                                                                
        Government reports further reveal that foreign                          
        intelligence agencies a mercenary computer hackers have                 
        been sneaking through telephone lines military and                      
        commercial computers.                                                   
                                                                                
        In Petersen's case, he pleaded guilty to cracking credit                
        bureau telephones and computers for get-rich schemes. But               
        FBI agents say they believe he also broke into a computer               
        used to conduct legal wiretaps.                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
        During a telephone interview several weeks before his                   
        arrest, Petersen alluded to the destruction that hackers                
        like himself can cause with a few keystrokes.                           
                                                                                
        "I wouldn't want the powers I have to be in the wrong                   
        hands -- someone with malicious intentions," he said.                   
                                                                                
Now, one could say the same thing about a karate expert, the owner of           
an Uzi, or a night-action photographer. Misused skills are, by                  
definition, potentially destructive. The novelty of potential abuse             
may strike some as worthy of hyperbole, but the reality is more                 
mundane. In fact, Stone provides no evidence that there is a growing            
cadre of sophisticated "hackers." The bulk of the serious computer              
crimes that we have followed in fact aren't the product of "hackers,"           
but of computer-literate folk who use the computer (instead of                  
lockpicks, guns, or fountain pens) to rip-off their victims. It's               
possible, of course, that Stone follows the school of thought that              
conflates "computer criminal" with "hacker." If so, then it's odd that          
he chose two "underground" computer wizards instead of focusing on              
some of the more serious computer crime that has occurred in recent             
years. We also wonder where Stone obtained his quote from "Agent                
Steal." First person? If so, the quote seems deceptively self-serving           
to Stone's slant. Because Stone seems willing to rely on information            
from Phrack, we wonder why Stone didn't allude to the Phrack interview          
in which Agent Steal condemned maliciousness (Phrack 44, File 16). We           
also wonder why Stone also failed to include the allegations that               
Agent Steal was also employed by the FBI.  Given the tenor of the               
story, it's unlikely that such an exclusion was impelled by a                   
commitment to reporting only verifiable facts.                                  
                                                                                
Third, Stone re-discovers the wheel:                                            
                                                                                
       The cases of Poulsen, Petersen and others illustrate how                 
       the stereotypical hacker driven by intellectual challenge                
       and curiosity is now being replaced by technically                       
       sophisticated criminals driven by greed.                                 
                                                                                
It's old news that computer-literate youth violate the law for                  
avaricious reasons. Computer afficianados, like others, are little              
different than anybody else. How about an alternative headline:                 
"Journalist Cheats on income taxes," with an accompanying story about           
how some reporters illustrate how literacy leads to greed-impelled law          
breaking?  It's a minor point, I suppose, but there's simply nothing            
new that these two cases illustrate. My sense in talking with Stone is          
that he was relatively unfamiliar with the issues of either case.  He           
also indicated that he was not on-line, he showed virtually no                  
knowledge of events or issues that one would expect from a competent            
reporter writing on such a topic, and he expressed little desire to             
learn. The result is old news wrapped in current hyperbole.                     
                                                                                
Fourth, the terrorist/espionage threat seems closer to science fiction          
than reality. Stone cites several sources for his claim that there is           
considerable potential for destruction.                                         
                                                                                
         The President's National Security Telecommunications                   
      Advisory Committee warned in a 1992 report that "known                    
      individuals in the hacker community have ties with                        
      adversary organizations. Hackers frequently have                          
      international ties."                                                      
                                                                                
         They include some members of the Chaos Computer Club in                
      Germany, who the Pentagon report says have demonstrated                   
      their willingness to work with foreign governments.                       
                                                                                
         The Chaos Computer Club is believed to have cracked a                  
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration computer and                
      supplied the Soviet Union's KGB with information obtained                 
      from Western military systems....                                         
                                                                                
We're not familar with the report cited, be we are familiar with the            
example adduced. Presumably, it refers to Pengo, et. al., the central           
characters of Cliff Stoll's _The Cuckoo's Egg_.  Had Stone bothered to          
read this classic, an inconceivable lapse for somebody writing on               
these issues, or had he read the Hafner and Markoff tome (Cyberpunks,           
Outlaws, and Hackers), he would likely have had a better grasp than             
citing a third-hand source that derived its information from an old             
issue of Phrack.                                                                
                                                                                
Are we over-reacting to what, is arguably, just another unsurprisingly          
simplistic and inconsequential media distortion of the relationship             
between computer technology and crime? Perhaps. But the issues such             
stories raise are not without consequence. If reporters were to write           
about the law, baseball, or the stock market with the same degree of            
cluelessness that some approach issues of computer culture, they would          
likely be quickly unemployed.  There is more accountability for some            
topics than others, and stories of cyberspace do not seem to be among           
those with high accountability.                                                 
                                                                                
Several issues are at stake here.                                               
                                                                                
First, cyberstories, because of their importance in educating the               
public, providing information for lawmakers, policy makers, and                 
criminal justice personnel, and contributing to the shared stock of             
social knowledge on which the public comes to understand and adapt to           
a new technology and its social implications, should be accurate.               
Instead, too many seem relegated to a status somewhere between op-ed            
and creative writing.                                                           
                                                                                
Second, it is not unreasonable to expect reporters who write on                 
substantive topics to exhibit at least minimal knowledge of their               
subject, or to at least be willing to demonstrate that they have done           
their homework before writing a story. Some nationally-known media              
reporters have been criticized for their work, and made a demonstrable          
effort to educate themselves to the relevant issues. Our hope is that           
Keith Stone will spend a bit more time researching if he writes on              
similar topics in the future. It is worth noting that Stone, to his             
credit, faithfully quoted my comments both accurately and in context.           
Unfortunately, they seemed irrelevant to his story.                             
                                                                                
Third, the media seem to repeat a pattern of recursive reporting: One           
medium will pick up a story, then others follow, either with tortured           
rewrites from the original or with follow-ups that look for a new and           
dramatic angle to emphasize. This is hardly unique to cyberspace                
stories, as followers of the OJ Simpson coverage might notice. But, it          
does represent a style of journalism that seems to more inclined                
toward marketing than toward providing substantive information.                 
                                                                                
Finally, there are legitimate threats posed by the computer                     
technology.  As with any technology, predators will find a way to               
abuse it, and reasoned discussion of these threats is necessary.                
Conversely, social accommodation to new technologies, whether in the            
form of responses to unacceptable behaviors or in inculcating                   
appropriate norms and values for accommodating accompanying changes             
require accuracy. When the media cry "wolf" too many times, or when             
they distort the facts and present skewed images, adapting to cultural          
change becomes more difficult.                                                  
                                                                                
The intent here is not to single out a single reporter, but rather to           
use that reporter as an icon (in the same way that he used his own              
subjects) to raise the issue of media coverage. After nearly a                  
half-decade of highly visible issues, it doesn't seem unreasonable to           
expect more reason and less hyperbole in the coverage.

Subject: File 5--Three More (of 100) Reasons to Oppose Wiretap Proposal         
                                                                                
           REASON 9: Privacy is a Basic Concept in Business                     
                                                                                
REASON 9: The last time such a sweeping change in wiretap law was               
       considered, AT&T recommended *a ban on all eavesdropping* except         
       in national security cases.                                              
                                                                                
  In 1967, when the federal wiretap law was first debated, a vice               
president of AT&T said that the Bell System favored a ban on all                
eavesdropping except in national security cases: "Privacy of                    
communications is a basic concept in our busines. We believe the                
public has an inherent right to feel that they can use the telephone            
with confidence, just as they talk face to face. Any undermining of             
this confidence would seriously impair the usefulness and value of              
telephone communications." (Lapidus, Eavesdropping on Trial).                   
                                                                                
                      Reason 12- Classification                                 
                                                                                
REASON 12: The FBI has hidden behind claims of classification rather            
than disclose information that would allow the public to determine              
whether the wiretap plan is needed.                                             
                                                                                
   Throughout the debate on the wiretap bill, the FBI has been                  
unwilling to describe  incidents where technology has frustrated a              
court ordered wiretap.  FOIA requests are routinely denied.  Even               
those agencies charged with independent assessment cannot speak openly          
about the plan.  (The General Accounting Office testified at an August          
hearing in the Senate:  "Because the details of law enforcement                 
agencies' problems and the specific technological challenges are                
classified, I cannot elaborate on them in this hearing"). Secrecy may           
be appropriate for military networks and classified systems,  it is             
hardly well suited to the nation's public communications network.               
                                                                                
                  REASON 24- "Capacity Requirements"                            
                                                                                
REASON 24:The FBI Wiretap bill allows the Attorney General to                   
      develop monitoring specs                                                  
                                                                                
  The proposed wiretap law says that the Attorney General will provide          
to telecommunications carrier associations and and standard-setting             
organizations a notice of "maximum capacity" required to accommodate            
all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace       
devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies            
may "use simultaneously."  Telecommunications carriers will then be             
required to ensure that systems are capable of "expanding to                    
the maximum capacity."  (Proposed section 2603(a))("legal code")                
                                                                                
                                                                                
REASON 43:The development of the Digitial Signature Standard (DSS)              
           suggests that standards developed to facilitate wiretapping          
           are less robust, and are costly to American business and             
           individual privacy.                                                  
                                                                                
  The recent development of the Digital Signature Standard provides a           
case study of what happens when an agency with legal authority to               
conduct wire surveillance is also given authority to set technical              
standards for communications networks.  Viewing the role of the                 
National Security Agency in the development of the DSS, MIT's Ronald            
Rivest said "It is my belief that the NIST proposals [for DSS]                  
represent an attempt to install weak cryptography as a national                 
standard, and that NIST is doing so in order to please the NSA and              
federal law enforcement agencies."  Stanford's Martin Hellman                   
concluded that "NIST's action give strong indication of favoring NSA's          
espionage mission at the expense of American business and individual            
privacy." (Communications of the ACM, July 1992)
