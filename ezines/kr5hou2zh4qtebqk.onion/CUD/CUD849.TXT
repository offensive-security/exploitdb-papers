Subject: File 1--Re: Cu Digest, #8.39, 27 May 96 (re Lance Rose)

I disagree with one of the points that Lance Rose makes in his
post on Civil Liberties, and the On-Line circus.

Lance talks about encryption, as hiding "a message right in someone
else's face.  It is like sticking a self-incriminating note in a
physical capsule that is uncrackably hard and strong, then lobbing
the capsule through the window of a police station to sit in the
middle of the floor among a bunch of cops, powerless to open it up
and figure out how to get the perp."

At the same time, he says that you can hide a message better by
leaving it in plain text, hidden among the huge mass of other things.

Except that today, searching ability is very strong, and only
going to get better.

Except that the police have shown that they will take an entire
computer and search it for anything that they want

Except that the goal is for everyone to use routine PGP encryption
on all messages that are not for everyone, just as everyone routinly
uses envelopes for their mail, and some people use security envolopes
that you can't just hold up to a strong light to see what's inside.

Except that it's a desire to stand out with an encrypted message,
but to be one of the normal flow of encrypted messages.

Except that any other form of hiding the data requires setting up
some special method, that has to be kept secret. With PGP, you don't
have to do anything special, really--the message is (at least with
the -a option) identified as a PGP message, and when (not if) PGP
is standard on unix and windows-96 (or -97) systems, will be just
as easy to read as plain mail.

Response to CUD #8.48, File 1--GAO hacker report: selling wind

You recently quoted something called the "Crypt Newsletter" on the
subject of computer-related yellow journalism & governmental
scare-mongering on the threat to national security from "hackers".

While I certainly am concerned about the characterization of
"hackers" as the lepers of the 1990s, I am very disappointed that
CUD would publish such a blatantly partisan, left-wing rant, as
news.  Do you intend CUD to become a forum for left-wing demagogues?
I should hope that you will continue to provide a balanced forum for
discussing issues of interest to all of us in the Net community, and
that you will in future at least insert a disclaimer before
reprinting material of such material.  Otherwise, CUD will cease to
be a forum for intramural discussion of serious issues, and instead
become merely a mirror of the moderators' apparently left-wing
political views.  What a shame, indeed.

I am a conservative, and I would like to point out the your
readership that it is a left-wing, liberal Democratic Administration
which has foisted the entire Clipper/Capstone/EES thing on us, and
which has consistently violated the rights of individuals and groups
in their quest to establish the Nanny State (Waco, Ruby Ridge,
etc.).  In fact, Republicans in the House & Senate have been
vociferous in both opposing EES and in watering down the more
heinous provisions of Mr. Clinton's so-called "anti-terrorism"
legislation.  The very sinister Filegate incident, which is far
beyond any "enemies list" kept by the Nixon Administration, clearly
shows the arrogance of liberals who think that government (i.e.,
themselves) always know best, and that their good intentions render
them above the law.

Remember, Chuck Colson went to jail for possessing one (1) FBI "raw"
file; the Clinton White House had at least 408!

>No one except an obscure lunatic named T. K. Jones in the Reagan
administration >really thought that either U.S. generals or their Soviet
counterparts would >call down the wrath of 10,000 nuclear warheads.

Whoever wrote this must be either extremely stupid or willfully
ignorant.  Weapons are made to be used, and the strategic arsenals
of both the U.S. & the U.S.S.R./Russia, while serving as a deterrent
against a general conventional war, are indeed capable of being
launched if National Command Authority so decides.  All one has to
do is look at the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Soviet's panicky
launching of Project RYAN during the 1980s to see that there was
(and still is, in my opinion) a real danger of unleashing
Armageddon.  That's why SDI was, and continues to be, as issue of
vital import.

In closing, I would like to compliment CUD for providing a
(generally) balanced and informative resource on public policy
issues such as Internet regulation.  While it is very easy to
criticize from the peanut gallery, I hope that my comments and
suggestions are received not as churlish sniping, but as advice from
a devoted reader who only wishes to assist in making CUD that much
more appealing to us all.

Response to article from Computer Underground Digest which follows:

Date--Sun, 16 Jun 1996 12:58:38 -0500 (CDT)
From--David Smith <bladex@bga.com>
Subject--Child Molester Database on the web

Great World Internet Services has set up a "child molester" database
where Internet users can add records about people who are child
molesters.  The ISP's philosophy is listed below. There is also a
separate disclaimer that information will be purged after 120 years,
and that Great World Internet Services does not verify any of the data.
There is a procedure for those who wish to dispute being entered into a
database.

There are expansion plans, too : deadbeat dads, crooked cops, elected
official crimes, known drug dealers, etc.

The site can be found at http://www.greatworld.com/public

>From its creator:

     Too many times in our twisted society, criminals are treated as
victims and victims are treated as inhuman and ignored. When our
President, our (In)Justice System, and our legislative bodies fail to
provide us with proper protection, then we as citizens must unite in
order to protect ourselves. The time for passivity has ended and the
time for proactive intervention is upon us.

     Therefore, as a parent and a citizen, I have made available a
database where child molesters can be listed. The difference between
this database and the databases of certain states (such as California)
are that this database is totally free. (There is no ridiculous $10
fee.) Also, anyone can look up information. In California, the state
feels that persons need to be able to prove a need for the information
before the information may be released. By golly, I believe that the
welfare of our children is right enough to know who these victimizers
are and that this information should be made available to everyone in
order to protect our families from joining the growing roster of
victims.

     Also, this database doesn't require that those listed first be
convicted. If you are a victim and have been abused, then it doesn't
require a court of law to validate what you already know. The same
applies if you are a parent or a close relative and you have first hand
knowledge that someone committed the crime. The idea behind this
database is to make people aware of the criminals so that we can
protect our families before it is too late.

     Most states do not list cases involving incest or victimization by
a relative or sibling. Feel free to list the victimizers here. If they
did it once, they are likely to do it again. Once a victimizer's own
children have grown up, they often turn to the children of others.

     There are advocates of these vicious heartless tyrant criminals
who say that once a person who has served their time, they should be
left alone. Buddy, I have one thing to say to you. Don't let the
proverbial door slap you in the tail on your way off this page.

     When a criminal victimizes a child, the child is emotionally
scarred for life. Nightmares often last throughout the person's entire
lfetime. Many times the person is unable to function effectively in a
relationship. No one is unable to ever take away what has been done. I
personally believe that their should only be one sentence for child
molestation--death. In my opinion, no child molester has EVER served
his time as long as he still lives.

     This database will help to remind the people in communities
throughout America that certain people are dangerous and should be
watched.
       -----------------------------------------------------

     Message for Child Molesters: Before you molest your next victim,
think twice. Perhaps your name will be plastered here for all of the
world to see. Your mother, your father, your brothers and sisters,
friends, the world--will know what kind of a living monster you really
are.

When John Law has a search warrant, as in this situation, I
recommend that such cooperation be full and complete.  You had better
have a very good reason (and lawyer) before you start willful
disobedience of legal orders.

That ISPs are willingly "pulling their pants down" for the police is
just not true.

Subject: File 5--Cyber Angel's response to Wired article

Attached is an excerpt from an announcement sent to the Cyber Angels
giving Gabriel Hatcher's response to the recent Wired article.

------- Forwarded Message Follows -------
From--         angels@wavenet.com (CyberAngels Director --Gabriel Hatcher)
Subject--      AOL project appeal

5) There is an article about us in Wired magazine's July issue.  Don't get
excited, it is not very complimentary.  Most of the article is spent
repeating what hostile critics have written about us, saying things like
"they don't understand the global nature of the Internet" (like we are 1100
members in _32_ countries and we don't understand the global nature of the
Internet?) or "they don't realize that posts could be forged"  (which was
one of the _first_ things that happened to _us_ when we started a year
ago!); or "they could mess up FBI investigations and be criminally liable
themselves" (some of our members are currently _teaching_ federal agents
how to download and decode binaries from the Usenet).

When will the journalists realize that CyberAngels are _not_ people who
have only just bought their first computer (although some of us are), but
also include users with 15 years+ Internet experience, programmers and a
number of professional law enforcement people.

  The Wired article is critical of Curtis Sliwa (co-founder with me of the
project), since he does not use a computer.  Hey guys, that's why _I_ run
the project.  Does Curtis have a right to an opinion about the Internet,
given his lack of hands-on knowledge.  Well I am not currently drilling for
oil in the antarctic ocean, but I think I have a right to be concerned
about the environment.  Is Curtis informed?  Well I keep him up to date.

Wired's journalist says he doesn't understand Curtis and my different
opinions, and questions how we can be effective since we disagree on
things.  Well watch us!   Do Curtis and I agree about the solutions to
Internet crime?  No, not always.  In many cases we disagree, but guess
what?  We don't have a problem living with the fact that we are not Clones
of each other.  It's called a pluralistic society guys, and it requires
tolerance to live in.  For those of you who didn't know, CyberAngels is not
a revolutionary organization.  We believe in and practice tolerance of
diverse cultures and beliefs, and since we believe in and practice freedom
of speech, we encourage healthy and vigorous debate and discussion, and we
can live with disagreement (unlike many of our critics!)   CyberAngels is
going strong, despite the fact that our members wouldn't agree on
everything.  What we have in common is a shared Mission statement and an
agreed Codes of Conduct.  That's enough for me.  I don't mind which side of
your bread you all butter! ;)

This is just a reminder of the upcoming FIRST Conference and
Workshop this year.  Please, forward this information onto
your constituencies and any other interested parties.  For those
people with websites, please help advertise with a link to
one of the conference websites listed below.  And lastly, if
it is possible to advertise the event in any advisories, bulletins
or newsletters, please do so, as this would be most appreciated.

#########  SPECIAL NOTE     SPECIAL NOTE      SPECIAL NOTE  ########

It is very important that if you have any plans to attend, please
register and make your hotel reservations *NOW*.   This is very
important because of several factors:

      1) Hotel occupancy is at all time high for this summer
         and with the Usenix conference the week before, hotels
         will be filled.
      2) The hotel will only honor the FIRST conference rate
         of $135/night till June 27, 1996. After this date, the rate
         will only be provided on a space available basis.
         The regular non-FIRST rate is $199/night.
      3) The price of gas has increased greatly in the California
         area and travel prices will be going up as the summer
         travel season starts.  People will use hotels more and
         drive less.
      4) Also the price of the conference does go up after July 13,
         1996 and that date is quickly approaching.

The annual FIRST Conference and workshop event is the only event of its
kind.   This event is focused on the field of computer security and most
specifically incident handling and response.   Past conferences have been
held in Karlsruhe, Germany and Boston, Massachusetts, US.   Each of these
conferences were international in scope and attendance with presentations
on the latest in vulnerability analysis, incident response, vulnerability
prevention, and general computer security.  Additionally, these conferences
served as the foundation for the improvement of computer security worldwide
via sharing of goals, ideas, and information.

The 1996 8th Annual FIRST Conference promises to continue this ground
breaking work.  Occurring in the heart of the Silicon Valley, home of the
microprocessor and the heartbeat of computing, this year's conference will
continue to promote FIRST organization goals of worldwide coordination
and cooperation.

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), is an
international organization that brings together a variety of computer
security incident response teams.  These teams include government
agencies, commercial companies, academic organizations and computer
vendors.

World-wide, FIRST aims to foster cooperation and coordination in
incident prevention, to prompt rapid reaction to incidents, and to
promote information sharing among members and the global community
at large.

Further information about the FIRST organization is available at
the FIRST WWW URL   http://www.first.org/first/

       Security Symposium is being held in San Jose, CA.  This means
       that not only could you save money on airfare by staying over
       a weekend, but you could attend two great security conferences
       back to back.  <http://www.usenix.org/sec96.html>

       Meet other security professionals in the area of incident
       and response.

       Improve your security program with the ideas presented.

       Save time searching for tools and resources.

       Join in the sharing of a wide range of experience and knowledge.

       Be a part of the "United Nations" of computer security organizations.

       Bring your family and tour the Silicon Valley and San Francisco
       Bay Area.
