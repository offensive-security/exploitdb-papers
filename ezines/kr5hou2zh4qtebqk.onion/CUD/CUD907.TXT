Subject: File 1--Re - Internet Forum in Italy (CuD 9.04)

The CU Digest #9.04 report "Internet Forum In Italy Subjected To
Censorship" was incomplete and inaccurate. As owner of the mailing
list censored, I would like to offer here more info for a better
understanding of the event. Hosted on a server located at Bologna
University, the mailing list LISA (Lista Italiana Sull'Accesso a
Internet) launched in early 1995 as an unmoderated area devoted to
discussion about social, cultural and economic aspects related to
the development of the Internet in Italy.

In these two years, discussion topics concerned many different
issues, such as net regulation, censorship, netiquette and online
behavior. As with most of similar lists, sometimes subscribers
opinions were strongly different occasionally leading to some sort
of personal animosity. In these cases, I called anyone (both in
public and in private) to the respect of other people words and
invited all users to get along with the netiquette, helding each
subscriber accountable for his/her own content, as clearly stated
in the charter list.

On November 1996, the president of a political association,
involved with electronic communications and repeatedly criticized
on the list, contacted the University professor in charge of the
computer department where LISA was hosted. He asked for an
official intervention to stop that verbal criticism, and the
faculty member decided to close down the mailing list.  No
previous attempt to contact myself, the list owner, was ever made:
I simply received the notification announcing the list immediate
closure. Two days later, I managed to get LISA re-opened at the
Utah University.

Nobody is questioning the right of Bologna University officials to
cancel any hosted list, but this decision (and its circumstances)
was a very harsh termination of an open discussion. LISA is an
on-going exchange of different points of view: what we were facing
was an attempt to restrain uncomfortable opinions, to silence an
area devoted to open confrontation on the Net.

Well beyond this single event, we netizens must keep close
attention to any concealment to stop the flow of free speech. In
the LISA case and anywhere in the world, we are forced to deal
with attempts to prevent public discussion, to refuse the
diversity of opinions. Choosing censorship instead of an open
debate is something we will never be willing to silently accept.

DETROIT -- Former University of Michigan student Jake Baker wrote on
the Internet about raping, torturing and murdering women. But he
didn't threaten them -- at least not under federal law, a court
ruled Wednesday.

Civil libertarians, who feared regulation of the vast reaches of
cyberspace, cheered the ruling. But others said it means women's
safety will take a backseat to free speech.

Ruling 2-1, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals panel in
Cincinnati upheld a June 1995 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge
Avern Cohn in Detroit dismissing charges against Baker. Cohn had
said the writings were constitutionally protected as free speech.

Baker, 22, now a computer science major at the University of
Pittsburgh, is the first person to be prosecuted for Internet
writings in a case that drew a storm of controversy about regulating
cyberspace.

Subject: File 3--Christopher Schanot sentenced in St. Louis

According to Saturday's St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Feb. 1,
copyrighted article by Tim Bryant), Christopher Schanot, was
sentenced Friday by U.S. District Judge Catherine D. Perry.  The
judge called Schanot "obviously . . . very skilled" and
expressed a desire that he not be influenced by others "who may
not have your best interests at heart."  Predictably, the
prosecutor called him a computer genius, and his own attorney
noted that he intended no harm.

According to the report, Schanot admitted in November "that he
had installed secret programs into a Southwestern Bell computer
system in St. Louis and in another system in New Jersey, giving
him access to the computer files of the seven regional phone
companies."  SWB and BELLCORE put the cost of "clean up" at
US$80,000.  The piece reports that the U.S. attorney's office
says Schanot originally gained access using a Southwestern Bell
employee's account, the employee having given his son access and
the son having shared the account information with Schanot.

Schanot should be released in about six weeks, according to the
article, since he has served jail time and been in a halfway
house for four and one-half months.  (The sentence is five
months imprisonment and six months in a halfway house.)

                    WHO'S WATCHING THE 'WATCHERS'?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                                  by
                             K.K. CAMPBELL

                              Net.column
                           The Toronto Star
                      Thursday, January 30, 1997


One of the most controversial aspects of cyberspace is censorship. A
widely accepted solution to eliminating the "unwanted" is self-imposed
censorship, through special software which blocks out types of content
not desired.

The appeal of these programs is that people needn't rely on distant
authority to dictate acceptability. We police ourselves; or at least we
have some control over how we will be policed.

The news media have generally blessed "blocking software" with
unexamined sprinklings of warm praise. After all, who dares suggest
that stopping your 5-year-old from seeing graphic gore, violence or sex
is bad? What could go wrong with that?

But, now critics are starting to ask, who is "watching the watchers?"
Could these watchers themselves develop more "creative applications"
for their power to silence? Could they apply their own personal
prejudices, or even their own hidden agendas?

Or is that paranoid nonsense?

Ask U.S. author Jonathan Wallace (jw@bway.net). Wallace says
California's Solid Oak software, which produces Cybersitter blocking
software, has added his site to its "block list" in retaliation for
critical remarks he made about the company.

Solid Oak claims 900,000 registered Cybersitter users.

Wallace, a New York-based software business executive and attorney is
co-author of the book _Sex, Laws and Cyberspace_ (Henry Holt, $34.95).
Net.column will discuss the book with its author next installment.

He's also editor of the monthly Webzine _The Ethical Spectacle_, which
focuses on "the intersection of ethics, law and politics in our
society."

The Webzine recently asked readers to not purchase Cybersitter because
of continuing reports of Solid Oak's "unethical behavior."

"In the book," Wallace says in a press release explaining his current
attitude to Cybersitter, "we took the position -- naively, I now think
-- that use of blocking software by parents was a less restrictive
alternative to government censorship. We never expected that publishers
of blocking software would block sites for their political content
alone, as Solid Oak has done."

Solid Oak unequivocably denies there is a political agenda of any kind
et work.

"Absolutely, 100 per cent not," Marc Kanter told the Toronto Star in a
phone interview. Kanter is Solid Oak's vice president of marketing.
"There is no hidden political agenda."

Kanter says someone criticizing Cybersitter would not be blocked. He
says Wallace's site is blocked because it "links information on how to
hack Cybersitter. We do not allow our customers to have hacking
information for the program."

Wallace told The Star that's not true. "There's no such information on
my site, nor is there on Peacefire's. I link to some pages maintained
by Glen Roberts, who -- along with some political commentary on
Cybersitter, and analysis of its blocking policy -- offers a (legal)
work-around. However, since his site is separately blocked by
Cybersitter, there is no reason for them to block my site as well."

Kanter dismisses Wallace's complaints. "The guy didn't do any
homework," Kanter says. "There are a few people who are right-wing
activists who are out there that are trying to defame the filtering
program. This is what leads to stories like you are doing -- and
hopefully you are not supportive of their actions."

Wallace didn't know what to make of that. "I've been called a
communist, a socialist, and a wild-eyed civil libertarian, but no one
has ever called me right wing before," he says. "Kanter has obviously
never read _The Ethical Spectacle_."

While Cybersitter, with fanfare, claims its mission is to block Web
sites containing pornography, obscenity, gratuitous violence, hate
speech, criminal activity, etc., an increasing number of investigative
Net.journalists also claim Cybersitter, without fanfare, blocks access
to Web sites based on political criteria.

                          FOR OUR OWN GOOD

This brouhaha began last summer when CyberWire Dispatch revealed
Cybersitter blocks sites based on political agenda, such as the
feminist National Organization for Women (www.now.org).

Dispatch journalist/editor Brock Meeks asked Solid Oak CEO Brian
Milburn (bmilburn@solidoak.com) about that.

"Milburn isn't shy about it," Meeks reported. "He was outright
indignant when he originally told Dispatch: 'If NOW doesn't like it,
tough'."

Solid Oak threatened to sue Dispatch for its article, but things
quieted down.

In December, the issue erupted again when 18-yearold Bennett Haselton
(bennett@peacefire.org) wrote an article about the company's selection
of blocked sites: "Cybersitter: Where Do We Not Want You To Go Today?"
(www.peacefire.org/censorware/CYBERsitter.html).

Haselton takes computer science and math at Vanderbilt University.
"Peacefire" is his own creation, a teen cyberrights group, average age
15.

According to various Net.journalists, Solid Oak now threatened Bennett
with a lawsuit and even tried to get the Peacefire site booted from its
host system (media3.net) by telling Media3 that Haselton was making it
"his mission in life to defame our product" by "routinely" publishing
names of sites blocked by Cybersitter.

(It should be noted it's easy to figure out which sites are blocked,
the software provides an output list. Try "playboy.com" -- blocked. Try
"whitehouse.com" -- okay. Try "peacefire.org" -- blocked. Try "now.org"
-- blocked.)

Unsuccessful in his pressure against Media3, Milburn instead included
the peacefire.org domain in Cybersitter's block list.

On Dec. 9, HotWired picked the story up
(www.wired.com/news/story/901.html). NetAction Notes
(www.netaction.org) quickly followed suit. Haselton told his story to
the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the EFF assured him it would
represent him, should Solid Oak deliver on its threat to sue.

On Dec. 20, The Netly News (http://netlynews.com) continued the
investigation of Cybersitter. Aside from the irony of Cybersitter
censoring the newsgroup alt.censorship, it "blocks dozens of ISPs and
university sites such as well .com, zoom.com, anon.penet.fi, best.com,
webpower.com, ftp.std.com, cts.com, gwis2.seas.gwu.edu, hss.cmu.edu,
c2.org, echonyc.com and accounting.com. Now, sadly, some libraries are
using it."

                       BLACK LIST TO BLOCK LIST

Wallace read the reports of legal threats against the teenager and
thought "Milburn was acting like the proverbial 800-pound gorilla."

So Wallace added a link on _The Spectacle_'s homepage called "Don't Buy
Cybersitter."

"I wrote the company," he says, "informing them of my actions and
telling them that they misrepresent their product when they claim it
blocks only indecent material, hate speech and the like."

Wallace says Solid Oak responded by adding his Webzine to its block
list. Learning of this, Wallace wrote Milburn and Solid Oak tech
support.

"I pointed out that _The Spectacle_ does not fit any of their published
criteria for blocking a site," he says. "I received mail in return
demanding that I cease writing to them and calling my mail 'harassment'
-- with a copy to the postmaster at my ISP."

Kanter acknowledges this. "He spoke to us more than once or twice -- he
continued to send mail -- mail like that is considered 'not wanted' and
is automatically sent back."

By the end of our phone conversation, Kanter had dropped the
"right-wing activist" explanation of who was behind the Cybersitter
complaints and offered a new one:

"Some of this rhetoric was started by someone we believe to be a highly
-- how do you put it? -- a highly homosexual individual, who did not
believe we should have the right to block any sites or links to
alternative lifestyles. That's how a lot of this got started."

Why is the National Organization for Women site blocked?

"Very simple. It contains links to gay and lesbian hardcore material. I
was on their page this morning, and there is a lot of offensive
material linked directly. Just go to their links page and start looking
at 'gay' and 'feminism.' Our parents don't want that kind of stuff."

I asked if he really meant "hardcore" -- suggestive of full-penetration
images/stories.

"Yes, by links through links," he clarifies. If someone followed the
links starting at now.org, they'd eventually find hardcore sexual
material.

Kanter says parents are not permitted to know which sites Cybersitter
blocks.

"That list is not given to anybody under any circumstances -- including
law enforcement agencies that have requested it." He says it's to
prevent the list from "getting into the wrong hands."

It would be a cybermap to naughtiness for some kids. And parents aren't
allowed to remove blocked sites from Cybersitter, although they can add
to the list.

Cyber-rights activists claim the incident underscores warnings they've
issued for years: While censorship software may first aim to protect
children against "pornography," it can quickly be adopted for political
agendas.

Subject: File 5--PROTEST: "Remember the Blackout"

THE CDA DISASTER NETWORK
February 5, 1997

Greetings!

Dave Winer -- a Silicon Valley software developer, essayist, and friend --
passed along a message today marking the first anniversary of the "Paint
the Web Black" campaign, which took place almost one year ago, on February
8, 1996, to mourn President Clinton's signing of the CDA into law.

Over 5000 Web sites participated in the 1996 campaign -- during which
Webmasters were encouraged to blacken the backgrounds of their Web pages to
protest the passage of America's first Internet censorship legislation. The
campaign was so successful (and so visually compelling) that newspaper and
television journalists throughout the US took notice of the story --
showing the world for the first time that the Internet community is capable
of rallying as a political force.

Dave is planning an event to commemorate this anniversary, so I'll let him
tell you all about it in his own words...

Work the network!

PS: I should mention that Voters' Telecommunications Watch and the Center
for Democracy and Technology were instrumental in organizing the protest
last year, so I want to send them my belated thanks.  Like the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union that Dave
mentions below, these groups also "deserve and require our support."

  A short piece, in the middle of much website work, to remind everyone
  that Saturday February 8 is the first anniversary of an important
  event in our new medium -- the web blackout of 1996.

  It's already history. In some circles it's not fashionable to
  remember that the United States government attempted to censor free
  speech on the Internet. I believe it would be cynical to overlook it.

  We defeated the law, even though we re-elected many of the
  politicians who tried to outlaw free speech in the name of protecting
  children.

  I'm building a website that will go live on Saturday to commemorate
  the protest, and to serve as a monument to the spirit of free speech. To
  remind us that this is a worldwide community, and no political system
  has the power to enforce its standards of decency on the medium.

  The battle to retain our rights is ongoing. Important organizations
  such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil
  Liberties Union deserve and require our support. It's easy to lose
  sight of the principles that we believe in, to be distracted by
  questions of corporate survival, of fear or greed. These are
  interesting issues, no doubt. But this is a creative and expressive
  medium and to protect its potential, unqualified free speech is
  essential.

  I played a small role in the web blackout last year. This year I hope to
  facilitate, to organize more sites and help to spread the word that
  free speech is not an option, not something that can be traded or
  limited and that no compromises are possible.

  <http://www.scripting.com/davenet/misc/blackout/>

  If you run a democracy-related site, large or small, please visit the
  page before Saturday and register. If you know someone who does,
  please pass this on. And if you value free speech, please visit the
  site on Saturday or later. It'll be a fascinating trip thru Internet
  history, if nothing else!

  Remember the blackout. Remember why it was necessary. Don't let
  people use children as an excuse to deprive people of their power to
  express themselves.

                   Fairmont Hotel     San Jose, CA

      Sponsored by the U.S. Public Policy Committee of ACM (USACM)


Panelists: Hank Barry, Pam Samuelson, Mark Stefik, Gio Wiederhold
Moderator: Barbara Simons, Chair, USACM


  o What is the role of copyright in all-electronic publication world?
  Will it be replaced by contract law?

  o Can the needs of authors who want to publish for renown (academics) and
  authors that want to publish for pay (entertainment etc) be handled in one
  mechanism?

  o Should browsing on the World Wide Web of full copyrighted texts be made
  illegal because people make temporary copies in their computer's memory
  when they look at a web page?

  o Should online service providers, including libraries and universities,
  have to monitor user accounts in order to enforce copyright laws?

  o Should firms that compile data have intellectual property rights so
  that scientists and news reporters can't use the data without permission
  or payments?

  o How should existing differences in national copyright be handled in a
  networked world where national boundaries and are little more than a
  speedbump on the information superhighway?

  o Does technological protection for copyrighted works inherently undermine
  fair use ?


These and related issues will confront the 105th Congress in the coming year.
They will also be examined by this panel, which will discuss controversies
surrounding the extension of copyright law to deal with cyberspace.
Examples include: How does proposed legislation reflect the net?
How much influence have lobbyists for the entertainment industry had
in writing legislation?  What should be the role of professional
societies in analyzing policy initiatives?

We will discussed legislation and international treaties that
have been proposed by the White House.  We will also examine both
technical and legal approaches to problems created by the net,
as well as how various approaches might impact the
science, technology, and business communities.

A significant amount of time will be allowed for audience
interaction in the discussion.

Subject: File 8--The Information Superhighway Transportation System

A while ago I was talking to my freenet's sysadmin and
I quipped that freenets are bicycles on the information
superhighway.  Upon seeing your CuD 9.04 issue, and the
item on OS airlines, I was inspired enough (or insipid
enough, take your pick) to do what follows.

THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM:
---------------------------------------------------

BBSs: A skateboard.  Usually dressed up to look cool, but can't
really go anywhere.  You hitch rides on cars to pretend to go
fast.  Only useful as local transportation.

Freenets: Bicycles.  Not very fast, you can't carry very much,
but you can get from A to B, and can do whatever you need to.
Usually you end up eating dust from some jerk in a Trans-Am.

LANs/WANs: Local bus system.  Limited area of where you can go,
but you can get transfers to other transportation systems.

Ethernet: Highspeed railways.  Very fast, but can only go where
track exists.  Adding new track is expensive, usually only where
management decides to build.

ISPs: Rental cars on Interprovincial/Interstate Highways.  Fast,
and you can move a lot of information (think of baud rate as
maximum vehicle weight).  If you can't afford gas (hourly rates
on ISPs) or the monthly payments, you can't go anywhere.

ARPA/MilNet: Tanks, trucks, and jeeps.  The roads cross military
installations, but connect to the highways.

AOL: Cars that have unlimited mileage.  Only 100 cars exist for
the 500,000 users, but no rules exist to force people to share
them.  The cars can only be taken where the roadmap says you can
go, and they often break down.  (You still have to pay for using
the car, even if you didn't get a chance to.  No refunds.)

Compuserve: Edsels.

AT&T/MCI/Sprint/Cable:  GM, Ford, and Chrysler.  They haven't
built any cars yet, and want a government created monopoly to
make it illegal for anyone else to build cars.

Netscape/Internet Explorer:  GUIded scenic tours of the Internet.
A lot of tourist stops on the way, meant only to look good.

Lynx: The same itinerary as Netscape/MSIE, but you drive
yourself;  you're too busy reading the map to see the sights.

ARCHIE: Rand-McNally atlas, a photo album, and a phone book.  You
can find out about the place, but not actually go there.

FTP/Gopher: Not a transportation method; actually, it's UPS and
Federal Express.

Finger: Fodor's guide books.

Telnet/IRC: Good old Ma Bell.  You don't actually go anywhere,
you just connect to the other end.

Usenet: A bulletin board in a post office.

E-mail: The postal service.  (About as slow as the real post
office when compared to the Web.)

BITNET: A courier service being bought out by the post office.
