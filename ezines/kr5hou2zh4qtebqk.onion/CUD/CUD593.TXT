Subject: File 1--Internet Resources -- U.S. Federal Gov't Information

((MODERATORS' NOTE: We receive periodic requests for sources of
government information available electronically. The following list is
the best single summary we've found)).

++++++++++++++++++++++++

I am sending out the 5th edition Internet Resources: U.S. Federal
Government Information.  New on this edition:  the list moves from
Dalhousie University to UNLV and will be placed on a ftp site.  Also,
I have added some discussion lists and am particulary interested in
local government documents discussion lists.  I hope to add to the
Library Catalogs section in the next edition with more catalogs which
maintain a separate documents catalog.

This list has grown almost beyond what is reasonable and I am seeing
increases in the number and availablity of government gophers.  I
see this as a positive development as more information becomes accessible
on the net and easier to find.

Please forward any changes and corrections to me directly.

    INTERNET RESOURCES:  U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION

Release 0.5, October 1993

Compiled/copyright by Maggie Parhamovich (magoo@nevada.edu),
Government Documents, Dickinson Library, University of Nevada Las
Vegas.

This document is available via anonymous ftp at the University of
Nevada (ftp nevada.edu  directory /liaison).

This guide was compiled primarily for librarians who provide
reference assistance for U.S. Government Documents and contains
telnet, gopher and ftp sites which may assist in providing
reference service for library patrons who need government
information.   It is impossible to fully index Internet sites and
I recommend utilizing Veronica, Archie and gopher servers to locate
more information.  FreeNets also provide easy access to government
information especially for local and state information.  A new
feature on the gopher at the University of Syracuse is Oliver which
provides easy access to many U.S. government sites and gophers.
Also, check out the NST and USDA Gophers which provide easy access
to many U.S. government databases.  Government information,
especially electronic is constantly changing and I welcome any
corrections and suggestions.

A word about gophers; if I know the telnet address and password for
a gopher I have included login instructions.  However, I recommend
you "point your gopher client" to other gophers instead of using
telnet.  This not only facilitates login but may also be easier to
use.  Your computing services can provide you with information on
your institution's gopher capabilities.

Original funding and research was conducted with the support of
ALA/USIA Fellows Program.  As a Fellow to Dalhousie University,
Halifax, Nova Scotia and the University of New Brunswick, Canada I
conducted a number of workshops on U.S. government information.  I
appreciate the support of the ALA/USIA Fellows Program which
provided the opportunity and time necessary to investigate
electronic government information.
