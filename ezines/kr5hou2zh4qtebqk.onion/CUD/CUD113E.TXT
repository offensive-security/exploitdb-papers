                        It CAN Happen Here

  Although Nobel Prize-winning novelist Sinclair Lewis is probably best
known for 'Main Street', 'Babbitt', 'Elmer Gantry', and 'Arrowsmith', my
personal favorites are 'It Can't Happen Here' and 'Kingsblood Royal'.  The
latter is an ironic narrative in which who suffers from racial prejudice
toward the black population discovers, through genealogical research, that
he himself has black ancestors.  The protagonist experienced a
life-challenging discovery that enabled Lewis to preach a gospel of civil
rights to his readership.

  The former is, perhaps, Lewis' most lengthy novel and it tells how a
radio evangelist was able to use the issues of morality and national
security to form a national mandate and create a fascist dictatorship in
the United States.  As Lewis showed how patriotic symbolism could be
distorted by power-hungry elite and religious fervor channeled into a
political movement, I was personally shaken.  As a highschool student,
reading this novel, for the first time, I suddenly realized what lewis
intended for his readers to realize.  "It" (a dictatorship) really CAN
happen here,  There is an infinitesimally fine line between protecting the
interests of society and encumbering the freedoms of the self-same society
in the name of protection.

  Now it appears that the civil liberties of game designers and gamers
themselves are to be assaulted in the name of protecting society.  In
recent months two unrelated events have taken place which must make us
pause: the raiding of Steve Jackson Games' offices by the United States
Secret Service, and the introduction of A.B. 3280 into the California State
Assembly by Assemblyperson Tanner.

  On March 1, 1990, Steve Jackson Games (a small pen and paper game
company) was raided by agents of the United States Secret Service.  The
raid was allegedly part of an investigation into data piracy and was,
apparently, related  to the latest supplement from SJG entitled, GURPS
Cyberpunk (GURPS stands for Generic Universal Role-Playing System).  GURPS
Cyberpunk features rules for a game universe analogous to the dark futures
of George Alec Effinger ('When Gravity Fails'), William Gibson
('Neuromancer'), Norman Spinrad ('Little Heroes'), Bruce Sterling ('Islands
in the Net'), and Walter Jon Williams ('Hardwired').

  GURPS Cyberpunk features character related to breaking into networks and
phreaking (abusing the telephone system).Hence, certain federal agents are
reported to have made several disparaging remarks about the game rules
being a "handbook for computer crime".  In the course of the raid (reported
to have been conducted under the authority of an unsigned photocopy of a
warrant; at least, such was the only warrant showed to the employees at
SJG) significant destruction allegedly occurred.  A footlocker, as well as
exterior storage units and cartons, were deliberately forced open even
though an employee with appropriate keys was present and available to lend
assistance.  In addition, the materials confiscated included: two
computers, an HP Laserjet II printer, a variety of computer cards and
parts, and an assortment of commercial software.  In all, SJG estimates
that approximately $10,000 worth of computer hardware and software was
confiscated.

  The amorphous nature of the raid is what is most frightening to me.  Does
this raid indicate that those who operate bulletin board systems as
individuals are at risk for similar raids if someone posts "hacking"
information on their computer?  Or does it indicate that games which
involve "hacking" are subject to searches and seizures by the federal
government?  Does it indicate that writing about "hacking" exposes one to
the risk of a raid?  It seems that this raid goes over the line of
protecting society and has, instead, violated the freedom of its citizenry.
Further facts may indicate that this is not the case, but the first
impression strongly indicates an abuse of freedom.

  Then there is the case of California's A.B 3280 which would forbid the
depiction of any alcohol or tobacco package or container in any video game
intended primarily for use by minors.  The bill makes no distinction
between positive or negative depiction of alcohol or tobacco, does not
specify what "primarily designed for" means, and defines 'video game' in
such a way that coin-ops, dedicated game machines, and computer games can
all fit within the category.

  Now the law is, admittedly, intended to help curb the use and abuse of
alcohol and tobacco among minors.  Yet the broad stroke of the brush with
which it is written limits the dramatic license which can be used to make
even desirable points in computer games.  For example, Chris Crawford's
'Balance of the Planet' depicts a liquor bottle on a trash heap as part of
a screen talking about the garbage problem.  Does this encourage alcohol
abuse?  In 'Wasteland', one of the encounters involves two winos in an
alley.  Does their use of homemade white lightening commend it to any
minors that might be playing the game?

  One of the problems with legislating art is that art is designed to both
reflect and cast new light and new perspectives on life.  As such,
depiction of any aspect of life may be appropriate, in context.
Unfortunately for those who want to use the law as a means of enforcing
morality, laws cannot be written to cover every context.

  We urge our California readers to oppose A.B. 3280 and help defend our
basic freedoms.  We urge all of our readers to be on the alert for any
governmental intervention that threatens our freedom of expression.  "It"
not only CAN happen here, but "it" is very likely to if we are not careful.
