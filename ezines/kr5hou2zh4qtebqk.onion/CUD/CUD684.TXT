Subject: File 1--CuD Cumlative Index Volumes 1-5

((MODERATORS' NOTE:  Alan Dunkin deserves continued kudos for his
helpful compilation of subjects (cummulative through volume 5).
Because we're often asked which issues readers can find a given topic,
we're running the entire index. Apologies for those with limitations
on incoming mail)

    THE COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGEST CUMULATIVE INDEX LAST UPDATED:
                    Through Volume 5 (end of 1993)

This is an index of things, people, handles, events, magazines,
places, events, books, hackers, TV shows, speeches, conventions,
search warrants, phreakers, secret service agents, news prints, and of
cyberspace itself.  Anything mentioned in an issue of the Digest, with
significance, is included in the Index.  For instance, a paper on
Operation Sundevil would be in the index under it's own header; but
Operation Sundevil mentioned offhand is not here.

Certain articles of the index may be under a separate title, for
example magazines, newspapers, hackers, specific trials, and some
other categories have their own headings for better reference.  Also,
magazines and newspapers will be surrounded by underscores, book tiles
are in capitals, and aliases in quotes.  Electronic publications are
under currently under magazines.

The index numbering system is organzied in the following manner:

                        ABB/C                   or
                        ABB/C1/C2/C3/..

                A - Volume number
                B - Issue number
                C - File or Article number.  A particular subject
                    may be in several parts of an issue, so each is
                    separated by a backslash.

I would like to point out that the index uses the a full eighty
columns in order to fit certain identifiers and spaces in.  I apologize
to those that cannot view in eighty columns, but for right now it's the
only system I've got.

If you have any questions, ideas, comments, or corrections, I will gladly
take them and see what I can do.
