Subject: "Computer down-underground Digest" (CDUGD)

Hello from New Zealand!  A few friends and I are starting up an
electronic publication similar to CuD to be called 'Computer - Down -
Under Ground Digest' (CDUGD). Its content will be similar to that of CuD,
but it will mainly deal with computing issues in New Zealand.

Since there has been some interest from outside of New Zealand, CDUGD
will be available for reading on the alt.hackers Usenet newsgroup.

Please send any suggestions/comments to: aaron@nacjack.gen.nz

Aaron Schiff
Editor, CDUGD

((Moderators' note: Aaron asked if we minded the similarity between
the title of his project and CuD. We have no objections, and wish him
well in his endeavor)).

Subject: CuD articles on Craig Neidorf's legal expenses

I have read repeated pleas on various networked discussion groups for
readers to help defray Craig's legal expenses.  While I sympathize
with his position and am in fact willing to help, I'm sure many of the
readers would like to know what all of that money was spent for.  I
want to help Craig, but I don't like the idea of giving over money to
lawyers.  The high price of legal help is arguably as much of the
problem as the reckless disregard for law and due process demonstrated
by the government.

Also, why are we asked to send money directly to the law firm that
defended Craig, and not to Craig himself?

I'm sure I'm not the only one among your readership with these kinds
of questions, and would appreciate it if you could address them in a
future issue of CuD.  Perhaps the computer underground, realizing how
much we are at the mercy of both lawyers and the government, would
find it in its interest to act to curtail their powers.

Subject: Update Of Info. In 2/5/92 Newsbytes Article On BBS Phone Rates

     If you do not recall, or are otherwise unaware, there is a
complaint (docket #UC-205) filed before the Oregon Public Utility
Commission intended to prevent US West from reclassifying BBS phone
lines to business rates. SysOp Tony Wagner filed the complaint back in
October. On 2/5/92, Dana Blankenhorn of Newsbytes Magazine released a
story, subsequently published in Newsbytes, that covered the Wagner
complaint. What follows is my own efforts to update Blankenhorn's
information. Herein, find corrections of some items reported by
Blankenhorn or simply left out of his article.

     Over the weekend of 2/8/92, I managed to conduct a short interview
with Tony Wagner of Portland, Oregon and First Choice Communications
BBS. I learned that Wagner's BBS is still online. This is contrary to
my understanding of the 2/5/92 Newsbytes story by Dana Blankenhorn.
Wagner's BBS is available at:

503-297-0278
503-297-0279
503-297-0343 [RESTRICTED ACCESS]

     Wagner mentions his dispute with US West in bulletin #1 on his
system. Here is full text of that bulletin.

======================= TEXT BEGINS ===============================
            Well The U.S. West phone company has decided that ALL
            Phone lines that have modems on them Should be classed
            As Business Lines..

            I have run a FREE Bulletin Board System for years out
            of my own pocket with out ever asking users to help
            pay the Cost of running the system..

            This will have to change if U.S. West has their way
            So please leave me mail as to how you feel about this
            better yet Call the Phone Company and tell them how you
            feel..

            If this happens I will do something like a Pay system
            that will cost around $1.00-3.00 Per hour depending
            on what parts of the BBS you want to use The Advantage
            to you will be unlimited Time on NO Time Limits If it
            get to busy I will add more lines Wildcat can handle
            250 Lines :-)

            I may then even add a bunch of Doors with Games Etc.
========================== TEXT ENDS ==============================

     Wagner's legal expenses were not dealt with in the manner implied
by Newsbytes on 2/5/92. Although an investigation of Wagner's
"Pacific Northwest Phone's" conference (the location on Wagner's system
of the FidoNet PNWBELL echo) would indicate that the subject of others
chipping in to pay for legal services was broached, Wagner informed me
that no group of SysOps or users ever paid for, or attempted to pay
Richard Samuels (Wagner's original attorney).

     Richard Samuels withdrew from Wagner's complaint filing at the
Oregon Public Utility Commission shortly before a December 10 hearing
date. Wagner represented himself at that hearing.

     The "Pacific Northwest Phone's" conference on First Choice
Communications additionally reveals an important item of interest. It
is apparent that US West and SouthWestern Bell are sharing information
about disputes with BBS operators in their respective operating
jurisdictions. Such is illustrated in the following message pulled from
the "Pacific Northwest Phone's" conference on First Choice Communications.

=========================== TEXT BEGINS ==============================
 From    : SCOTT LENT                        Number    : 223 of 241

Conf    : 505 - Pacific Northwest Phone's


That may or may not be of interest to those of you serviced by US West:

A group of sysops in Missouri met with representatives from Southwestern Bell
on 01/07/92 in St. Louis for the second in a series of negotiations. At the
meeting, William Bailey, District Manager-Rate Administration, divulged that
he had been in contact with "someone from US West," and that their
conversation included discussion of their respective telephone tariffs.
Specifically, he made reference to your (Oregon's) tariff wording that
refers to "domestic use."

This information is two-fold.  First, you now know that your RBOC people are
in contact with others about tariff wording.  Secondly, your RBOC people are
aware that other RBOCs are negotiating with their consumers over regulations
that affect the modeming community.

=========================== TEXT ENDS =================================


     Wagner has retained attorney Kevin Myles to represent him in his
complaint case at the Oregon Public Utility Commission. Myles has until
March 3, 1992 to file a brief. A round of reply briefs, from the
opposing parties in the complaint, is also possible.

Subject: FULL TEXT: Calif. data-priv/comp.crime bill

   This includes the full text of legislation that was introduced Feb.
10th in the California State Senate by a senior member of that body,
the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Bill Lockyer of
Southern Alameda County.  This copy of the bill plus staff background
comments is being uploaded within days of its availability in Senate
offices.

SB1447 TOPICS
   Sec.1:  "Privacy Act of 1992", Senate Bill 1447 (Lockyer, Privacy)
   Sec.2:  Driver's licenses: Use of human-readable and magstripe information
   Sec.3:  Privacy: Rights of employees and prospective employees
   Sec.4:  Computer crime laws: Modifications
   Sec.5:  Automatic vehicle identification [AVI] systems: Control of uses

   Introductory comments and details of notation conventions     [757/5191]
   Reformatted verbatim text of the Feb. 10th bill             [3227/21285]
   Background notes prepared by Sen. Lockyer's assistant       [2465/15546]
If printed, this would take approximately 12 pages.

REPORTEDLY A LEGISLATIVE "FIRST"
   This effort in "electronic democracy" may be the first time that state
legislation has been distributed online, for access by the general public,
at the same time it becomes available to legislators and their staff.
   A senior member of the Senate computer system's technical staff reportedly
said they have never-before down-loaded a machine-readable copy of initial
legislation onto a personal computer for redistribution on public computer
networks.
  Furthermore, Sen. Lockyer's Legislative Assistant responsible for the bill
said he knows of no prior instance where legislative staff have gone online
on public nets to seek citizen input and discussion about new legislation.

SOURCES OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS & INFORMATION
   Mr. Ben Firschein is the Legislative Assistant to Sen. Lockyer who is
handling this bill:

   D.  That backgrounder file, converted to Word-5.0 Macintosh format.

REPRESENTING LEGISLATION-IN-PROGRESS: A NOTATION PROBLEM
   In the California Senate, printed legislation-in-progress uses the
following conventions:
  When stating new legislation, *plain-text* states PROPOSED law.
  When *amending* current law, *plain-text* states the CURRENT law, and
*strike-thru text* indicates current law to be deleted while *underscored* or
*italicized* text represents wording to be added to those current statutes.
Deletions and additions represented by strike-thru and underlining or italics
*amend* current law.
  But, the basic ASCII character-set -- and a great many older terminals and
computer printers -- have no strike-thru, italics or underlining.  So, here
is how that unavailable notation is represented in this document:
    [[ annotation ]] -- explanatory comments by "uploader" Jim Warren
       all capitals  -- originally bold-face text; no legislative meaning
  Unless stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    -- text of new legislation, proposed to be new law
  When stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    -- text of current law to remain unchanged
    << strikethru >> -- text in current law, proposed for deletion
    %% underscore %% -- text proposed to be added to current law.

THE BEGINNING ...
  The introduction of this legislation in the Senate is the beginning of
a lengthy process or review and revision by amendment, prior to its possible
passage into law.
  Please send your comments and suggestions about the legislation -- and
about the Senate staff's active cooperation in making it publicly available,
online -- to Mr. Firschein and Sen. Lockyer.

TO: Interested parties
FROM: Ben Firschein, Senator Lockyer's Office
DATE: February 14, 1992

RE: BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON SB 1447 (LOCKYER, PRIVACY)
   You should have received a copy of SB 1447 (Lockyer, Privacy) in the mail
recently.  Senator Lockyer introduced the bill in an effort to address some
of the concerns raised at the privacy hearing on December 10, 1991.
   This memorandum is intended to explain the intent of the various sections
of the bill, but it is not a committee analysis.
   (A committee analysis will be forthcoming at a later date, when the bill
is set for a hearing).  We welcome suggestions as to how to clarify the
language of the bill, or otherwise improve the bill.


SECTION 1: CITATION
   The bill may be cited as the "Privacy Act of 1992"

SECTION 2: INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM DRIVER'S LICENSES
   This section requires the written consent of a consumer for a business
entity to (1) sell information obtained from the consumer's driver's license
or (2) use such information to advertise goods or services.
   The section is intended to cover instances where a consumer presents a
driver's license or identification card for identification purposes during a
business transaction.  The section is not intended to prevent businesses from
using driver's license information for business record-keeping, or for other
purposes related to the transaction (i.e. authorizing a transaction).
   The section is not intended to change existing law with respect to the
ability of businesses to obtain driver's license information from other
sources (such as DMV records).
   The need for this section is heightened by the new "magstripe" drivers
license developed by the Department of Motor Vehicles.  This license has a
magnetic stripe on the back which contains much of the information on the
front of the license.  The stripe will enable a business entity to store
information contained on a driver's license simply by scanning the card
through a reader.
   A publication by the Department of Motor Vehicles dated May 1991
("Department of Motor Vehicles Magnetic Stripe Drivers License/Identification
Card") states that "using point of sale (POS) readers and printers, the
business community can electronically record the DL [driver's license] /ID
number on receipts and business records."  The publication notes that
"magnetic stripe readers are readily available, relatively low in cost, and
are already available in many retail outlets."
   However, a merchant might access much more than the driver's license/ID
number; the publication notes that "readers have been produced, and market
available readers can be modified that will read the three tracks of
information contained on the California card."  According to the publication,
the tracks contain information such as license type, name, address, sex,
hair-color, eye-color, height, weight, restrictions, issue date.

SECTION 3:
DEPRIVATION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF EMPLOYEES OR PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES
   This section provides that an employer shall be liable to an employee or
prospective employee for damages caused by subjecting an employee to
discipline or discharge or denying employment to a prospective employee, on
account of the exercise by that person of privacy rights guaranteed by the
California Constitution.
   This section is modeled after Connecticut Labor Code Section 31-51q.  The
Lockyer bill goes further than the Connecticut statute in that it applies to
prospective as well as current employees.
   The bill would allow punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees to be
awarded pursuant to Section 3 (page 3 lines 10-12).
   The bill would specify that if the court decides that an action for
damages was brought by an employee or a prospective employee without
"substantial justification," the court may award costs and reasonable
attorney's fees to the employer (page 3, lines 12-15).
   As with the Connecticut statute, an employee's cause of action would only
exist if the activity for which the employee was disciplined or discharged
did not "substantially interfere with the employee's bona fide job
performance or working relationship with the employer." (Page 3, lines 4-5).
   POSSIBLE AMENDMENT: The language in the bill covering prospective
employees (page 3, lines 6-9) omits the "substantial interference" language
contained in the section covering existing employees.  Perhaps the bill
should specify that a prospective employee lacks a cause of action if the
prospective employer has a compelling business interest in rejecting someone
because they engaged in certain acts (even though those acts were protected
by the constitutional right to privacy).
   Such an amendment would be consistent with cases such SOROKA V. DAYTON
HUDSON CORPORATION, 91 Daily Journal D.A.R. 13204 (1st Appellate District).
The court in SOROKA found that a psychological screening test administered to
Target Store security officer applicants violated the applicants' state
constitutional right to privacy when it inquired about their religious
beliefs and sexual orientation, because there was no compelling need for the
test.
   POSSIBLE AMENDMENT # 2: One of the participants in the privacy hearing
suggests language making it clear that the rights and remedies set forth in
the section are not exclusive and do not pre-empt or limit any other
available remedy.
   POTENTIAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS SECTION: Some may argue that in light of
cases such as Soroka, this statute is unnecessary, because these rights are
already set forth in existing case law.
   They may also point out that the California Supreme Court held in WHITE V.
DAVIS that the right to privacy is self-executing, meaning that every
Californian has standing to sue directly under Article I, Section I of the
California Constitution for a privacy violation.  WHITE V. DAVIS (1975) 13
Cal.3d 757, 775.  Given that the right to privacy is self-executing, why is a
statute needed?
   The answer is that case law is in a state of flux, and there is no
guarantee that future courts will construe Article I in such a liberal
fashion.  Also, the bill is an improvement over existing case law in that it
specifically lists the types of damages that may be awarded, including
punitive damages, and reasonable attorney's fees.

SECTION 4. COMPUTER CRIMES
   Jim Warren (one of the witnesses at the hearing) posted the Leg Counsel
draft of the bill on one of the networks and showed me some of the responses.
This section generated most of the comments, some of which were quite vocal.
   First a word of caution to those uninitiated in the ways of the
Legislature: MOST OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS SECTION IS EXISTING LAW.  Our
proposed additions are contained in language that is in italics or
underlined.  IF IT IS NOT IN ITALICS OR UNDERLINES, IT IS EXISTING LAW.
   PROPOSED ADDITION #1 (page 7, line 25): Extend the existing computer crime
statute [Penal Code Section 502] to allow civil recovery by any injured party
against someone convicted under Section 502 of breaking into a computer. (The
existing law just allows recovery by the owner or lessee of a computer
system). For example, if someone is convicted under Section 502 of breaking
into TRW's computers and altering credit records, the existing statute would
allow TRW to recover against the hacker in a civil suit, but the statute
would not allow someone whose credit history was injured by the hacker to sue
the hacker under statute.
   PROPOSED ADDITION #2 (page 7, lines 30-33): Extend Penal Code Section 502
to allow civil recovery against a convicted hacker for more than just the
cost of expenditures necessary to verify that a computer system was or was
not altered, damaged, or deleted by the access.  The proposed language would
allow civil recovery for ALL CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES resulting
from the intrusion.
   PROPOSED ADDITION #3 (page 7, lines 38-40 & page 8, lines 1-6): Create a
cause of action against those who "recklessly store or maintain data in a
manner which enables a person to commit acts leading to a felony conviction
under this section."
   The section is intended to address the situation where someone stores
information (e.g. credit data) in a manner which easily allows unauthorized
access, and the person who is able to access the information as a result of
the lack of safeguards injures a third party (e.g. a creditor, or a person
whose credit history is altered).
   The source of the section is the case of PEOPLE V. GENTRY 234 Cal.App.3d
131 (1991).  In that case, a hacker figured out that if he queried the credit
databases of TRW, CBI, or Trans Union, about a nonexistent person, each
system would create a new file for that non-existent person.  The non-
existent person would have an exemplary credit history, because there was no
negative credit information in the new file.  The hacker in the GENTRY case
went into the business of rehabilitating people's credit history by having
them change their name, and then creating credit files on these "new" people.
   The court stated in a footnote "we do not address the potential liability
to innocent third parties who might be harmed by this feature of the software
program.  Although Gentry found a weakness in the program and exploited it,
responsibility should not rest solely with the felon. Credit reporting
companies should recognize that this flaw is needlessly risky and remedy it."
(GENTRY, page 135, footnote 3).
   POTENTIAL CONCERNS:  some people who have seen the bill worry that section
4 would apply to someone (e.g. a computer bulletin board operator) who stores
information on a computer about how to commit a crime (e.g. information about
how to break into a computer, or how to build a bomb)
   The section is intended to be limited to reckless storage of data in a
manner which enables a person to commit acts LEADING TO A FELONY CONVICTION
UNDER SECTION 503 (not other types of criminal acts).  "Reckless storage" is
intended to mean maintaining a system that lacks appropriate security
safeguards; it is not intended to include storing information about how to
commit crimes. Hopefully any potential ambiguities can be clarified through
amendments.
   PROPOSED ADDITION #4: The bill requires the reporting to local law
enforcement of violations of the computer crime statute (Penal Code Section
503) within 60 days after such violations become known to the owner or lessee
of a computer system (page 8, lines 26-34).  The bill states that "failure to
report a previous violation of this section to a local law enforcement
agency...may constitute evidence of [reckless storage of data]."
   This is intended to ensure that people report such crimes to law
enforcement.  There are anecdotal reports that some of these crimes are not
being reported because people are concerned about bad publicity resulting
from reports that their systems were broken into.
   POSSIBLE AMENDMENT: it has been suggested that the reporting requirement
be limited to certain types of systems, or to a certain level of monetary
loss.  Objections have been raised that the bill would apply equally to
someone who operates a home computer and to a business that operates a large
mainframe.  One could argue that the reporting requirement is more essential
where a computer owner has a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary duty to the people
whose records are stored on the system (e.g. accounting or credit records).
An accountant's or a credit company's failure to report a computer break-in
is more serious than a computer game bulletin board operator's failure to
report a break in.
   One possible objection to restricting the reporting requirement to a
certain level of financial loss is that financial loss is hard to quantify.
   However, Section 503 already uses amount of financial loss to determine
the type of criminal penalty to apply, so one could argue that amount of
monetary loss could similarly be used as an indication of the need to
report.

SECTION 5. AUTOMATIC VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS
   Existing law directs Caltrans to develop specifications for automatic
vehicle tracking systems for toll facilities, such as those on bridges
(Streets and Highways Code 27565).  People will soon be able have a device
installed in their car which allows them to drive through a toll facility
without stopping.  The device will send a signal to a computer,  which will
keep track of their use of the facility.  At the end of the month, they will
get a bill. Presumably there will continue to be booths that people can drive
through and pay cash.
