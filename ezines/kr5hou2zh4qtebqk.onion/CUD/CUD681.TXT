Subject: File 1--Re: Exon Amendment - text of existing laws

OK, so now that we've put the Exon amendment text out there (see CuD
6.79), it occurred to me that it isn't all that useful if you don't
have the text of what it proposes to amend! So here is Section 223 of
the Communications Act as it exists today, and the text of the
"safe-harbor" regulation that implements part of it.

                     ============================
FCC RESTRICTIONS ON OBSCENE AND INDECENT TELEPHONE TRANSMISSIONS

A.  STATUTE - Title 47, Section 223 of the United States Code (rev. 1989)

@ 223.  Obscene or harassing telephone calls in the District of
Columbia or in interstate or foreign communications

(a) Whoever--
   (1) in the District of Columbia or in interstate or foreign
communication by means of telephone--
     (A) makes any comment, request, suggestion or proposal which is
obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent;
     (B) makes a telephone call, whether or not conversation ensues, without
disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or
harass any person at the called number;
     (C) makes or causes the telephone of another repeatedly or
continuously to ring, with intent to harass any person at the called
number; or
     (D) makes repeated telephone calls, during which conversation
ensues, solely to harass any person at the called number; or
   (2) knowingly permits any telephone facility under his control to
be used for any purpose prohibited by this section, shall be fined not
more than $ 50,000 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

(b)(1) Whoever knowingly--
     (A) within the United States, by means of telephone, makes
(directly or by recording device) any obscene communication for
commercial purposes to any person, regardless of whether the maker of
such communication placed the call;
or
     (B) permits any telephone facility under such person's control to
be used for an activity prohibited by subparagraph (A), shall be fined
in accordance with title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not
more than two years, or both.
   (2) Whoever knowingly--
     (A) within the United States, by means of telephone, makes
(directly or by recording device) any indecent communication for
commercial purposes which is available to any person under 18 years of
age or to any other person without that person's consent, regardless
of whether the maker of such communication
placed the call; or
     (B) permits any telephone facility under such person's control to
be used for an activity prohibited by subparagraph (A), shall be fined
not more than $ 50,000 or imprisoned not more than six months, or
both.
   (3) It is a defense to prosecution under paragraph (2) of this
subsection that the defendant restrict access to the prohibited
communication to persons 18 years of age or older in accordance with
subsection (c) of this section and with such procedures as the
Commission may prescribe by regulation.
   (4) In addition to the penalties under paragraph (1), whoever,
within the United States, intentionally violates paragraph (1) or (2)
shall be subject to a fine of not more than $ 50,000 for each
violation. For purposes of this paragraph, each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
   (5)(A) In addition to the penalties under paragraphs (1), (2), and (5),
whoever, within the United States, violates paragraph (1) or (2) shall
be subject to a civil fine of not more than $ 50,000 for each
violation. For purposes of this paragraph, each day of violation shall
constitute a separate violation.
     (B) A fine under this paragraph may be assessed either--
       (i) by a court, pursuant to civil action by the Commission or any
attorney employed by the Commission who is designated by the
Commission for such purposes, or
       (ii) by the Commission after appropriate administrative proceedings.
   (6) The Attorney General may bring a suit in the appropriate
district court of the United States to enjoin any act or practice
which violates paragraph (1) or (2). An injunction may be granted in
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

(c)(1) A common carrier within the District of Columbia or within any
State, or in interstate or foreign commerce, shall not, to the extent
technically feasible, provide access to a communication specified in
subsection (b) from the telephone of any subscriber who has not
previously requested in writing the carrier to provide access to such
communication if the carrier collects from subscribers an identifiable
charge for such communication that the carrier remits, in whole or in
part, to the provider of such communication.
   (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), no cause of action may be
brought in any court or administrative agency against any common
carrier, or any of its affiliates, including their officers,
directors, employees, agents, or authorized representatives on account
of--
     (A) any action which the carrier demonstrates was taken in good
faith to restrict access pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection;
or
     (B) any access permitted--
       (i) in good faith reliance upon the lack of any representation
by a provider of communications that communications provided by that
provider are communications specified in subsection (b), or
       (ii) because a specific representation by the provider did not
allow the carrier, acting in good faith, a sufficient period to
restrict access to communications described in subsection (b).
   (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a provider of
communications services to which subscribers are denied access
pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection may bring an action for a
declaratory judgment or similar action in a court. Any such action
shall be limited to the question of whether the communications which
the provider seeks to provide fall within the category of
communications to which the carrier will provide access only to
subscribers who have previously requested such access.

B. FCC REGULATION - Title 47, Section 64.201 of the Code of Federal
   Regulations

                 Restrictions on obscene or indecent telephone
                               message services.

                                 47 CFR 64.201

   It is a defense to prosecution under section 223(b) of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 223(b), that the
defendant has taken one of the actions set forth in paragraph (a),
(b), or (c) of this section to restrict access to prohibited
communications to persons eighteen years of age or older, and has
additionally complied with paragraph (d) of this section, where
applicable:

   (a) Requires payment by credit card before transmission of the message; or

   (b) Requires an authorized access or identification code before
transmission of the message, and where the defendant has:

   (1) Issued the code by mailing it to the applicant after reasonably
ascertaining through receipt of a written application that the
applicant is not under eighteen years of age; and

   (2) Established a procedure to cancel immediately the code of any
person upon written, telephonic or other notice to the defendant's
business office that such code has been lost, stolen, or used by a
person or persons under the age of eighteen, or that such code is no
longer desired; or

   (c) Scrambles the message using frequency inversion techniques so
that it is unintelligible and incomprehensible to the calling party
without use of a descrambler by the calling party; and

   (d) Where the defendant is a message sponsor or subscriber to mass
announcement services tariffed at this Commission and such defendant
prior to the transmission of the message has requested in writing to
the carrier providing the public announcement service that calls to
his message service be subject to billing notification as an adult
telephone message service.

This purports to be Field Circular 19-146 of the US Army Military Policy
School.  Supposedly intended for US Army Criminal Investigation (Defence?)
Command Special Agents only, it appears to be an unauthorized photocopy of a
typed government document.  No date is included in any of the supposed
government material:  the Loompanics copyright date is 1990.

It doesn't really matter if this is an official government document or not.
The material is fairly pedestrian:  after a reasonably detailed set of
instructions on how to exercise a search warrant for computer equipment
(although not how to analyze the equipment, once you have it), the bulk of the
book defines various types of computer crimes.  Much of this would have serious
data security types going, "Well, maybe ...," but, at the same time, it isn't
bad enough as to indicate that American military policy are being misinformed
in what is, after all, a specialized topic.

A possibly interesting bit of arcana for the well-stocked data security
library.

                 New Book in Franch Language: INTERNET

Internet is now available from Editions JCI, Inc. (2700 Joliette #201,
Montreal, Quebec, H1W 3G9, Canada)

The *Internet* book goes beyond all business school case studies and
descriptions of Internet tools, teaching French readers how to effectively
use the Internet to boost sales and cut costs. Through real world
examples and expert advice, you'll learn how to use the Internet to
build European/international market share, track down business leads,
communicate with colleagues, search online databases, provide cost-
effective customer support and access time-critical information.

You'll also explore the many business opportunities now available on
the Internet and get tips on shopping for the best deal on Internet access
and cybel-mail space.

Just as importantly you'll learn about the culture of the Internet, find
out what type of advertising is acceptable and can generate a positive
response, and which forms are verboten and can provoke community
hostility (the famous 'nethiquette').

The *Internet* also contain detailed descriptions of the author's first-
hand and experienced experience in doing business on the Internet. Co-
author Jean-Bernard Condat is a veteran information science writer and
publisher of electronic newsletter that tracks trends and developments
in electronic newspaper and magazine publishing. Co-author Nicolas Pioch

Subject: File 4--Clipper T-shirts

    Information and opposition to the Clipper proposal is strong
on the Internet.  But it is far too unknown to the 'outside'
community.  Everyone concerned by this issue should inform
all the people they know of its implications.  One way to
increase awareness and show your opinion is to wear it:).

    I would like to offer an anti Clipper/Skipjack T-shirt.
They would be white with black printing and cost
approximately $5.00 plus $2.90 shipping to US locations.
That is the cost to produce one shirt.  I am trying to
spread awareness not make money.

    I need to know if people are interested in this idea and
what should the shirts say?

Two quick ideas are:
    "Skip Skipjack"
    or
    "Just Say No to Clipper"

    Please send comments, suggestions, and questions to
normh@crl.com.  If more than a few people are interested I
will go ahead and have the shirts made and post how to get
one.

    A worthy cause is better if it benefits another good cause
so the shirts will be silk-screened by Zerolith, part of a
non-profit organization that employs, shelters, and assists
homeless youth.  If you would like to talk with Zerolith or
donate money directly here is how to contact them.

[If you've only got 2 minutes, skip down to the "What You Can Do"
 section.]

[Washington insiders say the phone calls and faxes (especially to
 Rep Jack Brooks) are starting to attract significant attention, and
 many people prophesize that the bill won't even have time to pass
 this session.  Thanks for your efforts!]

The FBI's Wiretap bills (also known as the DT - Digital Telephony bills)
mandate that *all* communications carriers must provide wiretap-ready
equipment so that the FBI can more easily implement their court-ordered
wiretaps more easily.  The costs of re-engineering all communications
equipment will be borne by the government, industry and consumers.

The bill is vague and the standards defining "wiretap ready" do not
exist.  Furthermore, the FBI has yet to make a case which demonstrates
that they have been unable to implement a wiretap.

There are fewer than 1,000 court ordered surveillances per year.  Even if
all of them are wiretaps, and even if all of them require the changes
mandated by this legisation, are we as a nation prepared to build
eavesdropping features into the phones of 250 million people, in order
to justify these wiretaps?  None of these wiretaps has been demonstrated
to be unimplementable, nor has it been proven that the cases could not
be made with other methods of electronic surveillance.

The Voters Telecomm Watch (VTW) does not believe the FBI has made a
compelling case to justify that all Americans give up their privacy.
Furthermore, the VTW does not believe the case has been made to justify
spending 500 million Federal dollars over the next 4 years to
re-engineer equipment to compromise privacy, interfere with
telecommunications privacy, and fulfill an unproven government need.

SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE
                          =================

   Dear __________,

   The recent Digital Telephony bills (HR 4922 & SB 2375) disturb me
   greatly.  The FBI has not yet made their case to the public that we
   need to build wiretap functionality into the telephones of 250
   million people to justify wiretaps which have not yet been proven to
   be difficult to implement.

   The bills would clearly compromise the privacy of all Americans with
   no counterbalancing benefit to either law enforcement or the public.
   The FBI has not demonstrated the need, and the cost is uncalculated,
   but is known to be at least 500 million tax dollars.

   Furthermore, the standards are undefined, as are the bodies that
   would enact these standards.

   For these reasons, I am opposed to the Digital Telephony bills
   (HR 4922 & SB 2375).

   Sincerely,

   _______________________

As a service to the community, The Electric Examiner is offering free
Internet publishing to candidates for office who will appear on Bay
Area ballots.  Internet users with access to the World Wide Web via
Mosaic, Lynx or other browser software can access these files as noted
below

While it is anticipated that candidates will mainly offer text files
like position statements, speeches and schedules, The Examiner's World
Wide Web server also supports photos, graphics and short clips of
audio and video.

Candidates can e-mail files to chrisg@sfgate.com for inclusion on the
server.  Each candidate will be granted an equal heading and space up
to the limits reserved for this project.

Candidates who do not have e-mail access can send files on 3.5-inch
diskette in either DOS/Windows or Macintosh format to
   Chris Gulker
