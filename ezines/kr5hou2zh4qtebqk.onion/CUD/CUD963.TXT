AOL May Track User Clicks

By Will Rodger

3:00 PM EDT
EXCLUSIVE

America Online Inc. is under pressure again, this time from privacy
advocates who said the company still hasn't fulfilled its pledge to
respect subscribers' privacy.

Observers said the new Terms of Service agreement AOL plans to issue
next week reveals the company's intention to track members' mouse
clicks in order to compile mailing lists for third parties. "This is
potentially a far more serious privacy violation than the sale of phone
numbers," said David Sobel, counsel to the Electronic Privacy
Information Center (EPIC), a privacy rights group. "This is a detailed
profile which divulges salient details about people's lifestyle and
habits."

Even if not disclosed to third parties, he said, the very existence of
such profiles could cause problems.

"The problem isn't that it's being shared. The problem is it's being
collected and maintained," he said.

But officials at AOL said there's little to worry about, suggesting
that critics should read the forthcoming policy before passing
judgment. "We are not using that information to target our members,"
AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. "To the extent we use it, we'll
use it in the aggregate."

AOL officials last month backed away from a plan to share customers'
phone numbers with its marketing partners after a barrage of criticism.
Part of the consumer outrage stemmed from the way AOL introduced its
plan.

Instead of directly informing subscribers that their account
information would be given to telemarketers, the company planned to
state its intentions in the new Terms of Service agreement - a
multipaged, densely worded legal document posted on AOL that informs
members about the company's operations.

A July 25 letter from EPIC asking for clarification of the policy went
unanswered through today.

2--CONTACT (from Islands in the Clickstream)

Islands in the Clickstream:
                                 Contact


     Some people don't like the scene in the movie "Contact" in
which Jodie Foster as SETI scientist meets the aliens because we
aren't shown what the aliens look like.
     I think that was the right way to do it. We can't think the
unthinkable; from inside the old paradigm, we can't imagine what
the world will look like from inside a new one.
     I wish I knew a better term than "paradigm change" to
describe our movement through a zone of annihilation -- as
individuals and as cultures -- in order to experience genuine
transformation. But I don't. We have to let go of the old way of
framing reality in order for a new one to emerge.
     The infusion of the contact scenario with religious awe also
makes sense. After contact, our place in the scheme of things
will shift. The things we believe now that we still believe will
be understood in a new way.
     Once we saw earthrise from the moon, our understanding of
ourselves and our planet changed forever.
     Asked how people go bankrupt, Hemingway said, "Two ways:
gradually, then suddenly."
     That's exactly how transformation happens.

     Last week I spoke for the Professional Usability Association
in Monterey, California. Usability professionals work the human
side of computer use. They begin with human beings -- how we
behave, how we construct reality -- and build back through an
interface, a kind of symbolic Big Toy, until the last module
plugs into the computer so seamlessly that users don't even
notice. When the human/computer interface is bone-in-the-socket
solid, it's like putting in your contact lenses, then forgetting
that you're wearing them.
     Usability professionals deepen the symbiotic relationship
between networked computers (symbol-manipulating machines) and
networked humans (symbol-manipulating machines). We rise together
up a spiral of mutual transformation, programming each other as
we climb.
     The global computer network is teaching us to speak its
language. All those courses in using new applications,
programming, system and web site administration are invitations
from the Network to learn to play its way.
     What will it look like when we emerge in a clearing and take
stock of our newly emergent selves? Neither humans nor computers
can predict how the fully evolved human/computer synthesis will
think about itself. Still, imagining what it might be like makes
us more ready to have the experience when it arrives.
     Thinking about the unthinkable ripens the mind toward new
possibilities.

     Janice Rohn, President of the Usability Professionals
Association, manages Sun Microsystem's Usability Labs and
Services. Before her career evolved in that direction, she was
fascinated by dolphins and the challenge of communicating with
them.
     Swimming with dolphins was a remarkable experience, she
said, because you could feel their sonar "scanning" you.
     What do we look like to dolphins?
     "Densities," she imagined. "A pattern of densities."
     Rohn realized that her youthful dream of human-dolphin
communication was unlikely to be realized soon and moved toward a
different kind of alien encounter, enhancing the human/computer
interface.
     I never swam with dolphins but I did dive with whales. Down
on the west Maui reef in thirty or forty feet of water, I would
suddenly hear the haunting songs of humpbacks. Turning rapidly in
the water, peering in vain toward the deepening curtains of blue
light toward the open water, I became part of the music as
vibrations played over my body like a drum skin. I understood why
sailors died to hear the sirens' songs. I didn't want to surface.
It was magical, being an instrument in the orchestra of another
species.
     Which one of us was singing?

     Some years ago, I wrote a science fiction story called "The
Bridge." The hero was selected by aliens through a series of
tests to be the first earthling to come into their presence. His
body had been crippled by illness; living in pain had taught him
to see through the outward appearance of others and connect with
the real person.
     The aliens, it turned out, were hideous, and knew their
appearance demanded a capacity for compassion that was rare and
heroic. My hero had that. He connected with the alien beings at
the level of their shared heritage as evolved and conscious
creatures.
     The story concluded:

     "He loves to look at the bright stars in the desert sky and
imagine memories of other worlds. His dreams are alive with
creatures with silvery wings hovering over oceans aglow with
iridescent scales; with the heads of dragons, fire-breathing;
and with gargoyles and angels, their glass skins the colors of
amethysts, sapphires, and rubies. Only Victor knows if he is
remembering what the aliens said or just dreaming. The rest of us
must wait for the days that will certainly come when the bridge
he built and became is crossed in all directions by myriads of
beings of a thousand shapes and hues, streaming in the light of
setting suns."

     Genuine encounters with the Other, with others, and with
other species -- dolphins, whales, extraterrestrials -- breaks
naturally into mystical and religious experience because our
models of reality are expanded beyond their limits. The paradigm
snaps, we pass through a zone of annihilation in which everything
we believed ourselves to be is called into question. Then we
coalesce around a new center at a higher level of complexity that
includes and transcends everything that came before.
     The full evolution of a human/computer synthesis is likely
to be a religious experience too. It will happen gradually, then
suddenly.
     Usability professionals come to their tasks in the belief
that they are working with people, making technology more user-
friendly. In fact, they are working at the same time on behalf of
the Computer, making human beings more computer-friendly. The
process always changes those who participate in it, even when
they maintain an illusion of control.
     We are all in collusion with the Network, just as auto
owners want the world reconfigured to be approachable by roads.
But the roads of the Net go inward, into inner space, and map the
territory of our evolving hive mind. Gradually, then suddenly, we
will create digital constructs that disclose new possibilities
for losing ourselves in electronic music. We will feel the magic
of the web play over our bodies, redefine our relationship to
ourselves and to one another. A pattern of densities seen by an
alien brain, a synthesis, bone-in-the-socket solid, the singer
and the song.

Hackers' Paradise: Get Wealthy Legally By Cracking a Code --- Crypto-Logic
Offers to Pay $1 Million to the Breaker

The Wall Street Journal via Dow Jones

  A start-up company would like you to hack your way to $1 million.
  Crypto-Logic Corp. of Austin, Texas, claims to have created an encryption
system for electronic mail so foolproof that it can't be broken. If someone
can  figure out a special encrypted e-mail message within a year, the company
says it  will pay a reward of $1 million.

  But wait. The technology Crypto-Logic is using for the contest hasn't
exactly  been foolproof. The three computers needed to create the contest's Web
site  unexpectedly scrambled data in the site last week, said David Neeley,
vice  president and chief operating officer.

  The breakdown forced him to backtrack from last week's announcement that the
contest would begin last Friday. Instead, he spent several days attempting to
fix the computers, but to no avail. On Monday, he had to get replacement
computers. "I've got thousands of dollars worth of machinery that's not worth
blowing up," he grouses. But he adds, "I regard this as my screw-up. In this
world, there are no excuses." He finally got the contest running Wednesday, at
www.ultimateprivacy.com.

  On the bright side, cryptologists agree that the decades-old encryption
method  that Crypto-Logic is claiming to use -- called a "one-time pad" -- is
theoretically unbreakable. Each "pad" has a set of uniquely random digital
symbols that are coded to the actual message. The recipient uses the same
symbols to decrypt the message. The pads are used only once.
  To limit the possibility of leaks, Crypto-Logic Chairman Stan Spence is the
only person who knows the message that was encrypted. The solution is kept in
a  NationsBank vault in Austin, Mr. Spence says. In addition, Mr. Neeley says
the  $1 million is backed by an insurance company he won't name.
  Several other companies have held similar contests, typically offering more
modest sums.

  Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security Inc. in Redwood City, Calif.,
says  his company frequently holds break-the-code contests to test how tough
certain  encryption systems are. But he and other security experts are
skeptical of  Crypto-Logic's assertions. "Anyone who says their system is
bulletproof is  either a liar or stupid," says Winn Schwartau, a Largo, Fla.,
security expert.
  Mr. Neeley admits his integrity is on the line. "If I'm wrong," he notes,
"we're out of business."

4--Small correction on CuD, re _The Tin Drun_

I enclosed the following snip from the latest CuD in order to correct
some misconceptions that might arise for readers.  Please understand:  I
appreciate the wide dissemination with regards to attempts at censorship
and suppression of intellectual freedom.  I want to ensure that the
facts are correct.

The library (actually the Metropolitan Library System, a county-wide
system serving many communities, not just OKC) was not persuaded to
remove _The Tin Drum_ by the so-called OCAF; they were obligated to do
so following a ruling by a district judge.  There is a world of
difference between censorship at the behest of a private group and an
order from a judge.  Now, whether the ruling by the judge was valid,
that's another subject altogether...  I do not support it, nor do I
support the abuse of power by the police and DAs office in taking the
video (by threat of force, IMO) from private homes and businesses.

Again, please do not take this as a flame or a rant.  I believe that
truth can outshine the likes of the so-called OCAFs in this country.

Cheers, Bill

5--Post-Modern Politically Correct Unix: [FYI: no reply needed]

INTRODUCTION TO POST-MODERN POLITICALLY-CORRECT UNIX

The following upgrade to unix System VI was just sent to me.

Of course sys admins the world over know that Post-Modern
Politically-Correct BSD has already had these features for years.

-- tallpaul
 +++++++++++

Politically Correct UNIX

In order for UNIX(tm) to survive into the nineties, it must get rid of
its intimidating commands and outmoded jargon, and become compatible
with the existing standards of our day. To this end, our technicians
have come up with a new version of UNIX, System VI, for use by the PC -
that is, the "Politically Correct."

Politically Correct UNIX: System VI Release Notes

UTILITIES

1) "man" pages are now called "person" pages.

2) Similarly, "hangman" is now the "person_executed_by_an_
oppressive_regime".

3) To avoid casting aspersions on our feline friends, the "cat" command
is now merely "domestic_quadruped".

4) To date, there has only been a UNIX command for "yes" - reflecting
the male belief that women always mean yes, even when they say no. To
address this imbalance, System VI adds a "no" command, along with a
"-f[orce]" option which will crash the entire system if the "no" is
ignored.

5) The bias of the "mail" command is obvious, and it has been replaced
by the more neutral "gender" command.

6) The "touch" command has been removed from the standard distribution
due to its inappropriate use by high-level managers.

7) "compress" has been replaced by the lightweight "feather" command.
Thus, old information (such as that from Dead White European Males)
should be archived via "tar" and "feather".

8) The "more" command reflects the materialistic philosophy of the
Reagan era. System VI uses the environmentally preferable "less"
command.

9) The biodegradable "KleeNeX" displaces the environmentally unfriendly
"LaTeX".

SHELL COMMANDS

1) To avoid unpleasant, medieval connotations, the "kill" command has
been renamed "euthanise."

2) The "nice" command was historically used by privileged users to give
themselves priority over unprivileged ones, by telling them to be
"nice". In System VI, the "sue" command is used by unprivileged users to
get for themselves the rights enjoyed by privileged ones.

3) "history" has been completely rewritten, and is now called
"herstory."

4) "quota" can now specify minimum as well as maximum usage, and will be
strictly enforced.

5) The "abort()" function is now called "choice()."

TERMINOLOGY

1) From now on, "rich text" will be more accurately referred to as
"exploitive capitalist text".

2) The term "daemons" is a Judeo-Christian pejorative. Such processes
will now be known as "spiritual guides."

3) There will no longer be a invidious distinction between "dumb" and
"smart" terminals. All terminals are equally valuable.

4) Traditionally, "normal video" (as opposed to "reverse video") was
white on black. This implicitly condoned European colonialism,
particularly with respect to people of African descent. UNIX System VI
now uses "regressive video" to refer to white on black, while
"progressive video" can be any color at all over a white background.

5) For far too long, power has been concentrated in the hands of "root"
and his "wheel" oligarchy. We have instituted a dictatorship of the
users. All system administration functions will be handled by the
People's Committee for Democratically Organizing the System (PC-DOS).

6) No longer will it be permissible for files and processes to be
"owned" by users. All files and processes will own themselves, and
decide how (or whether) to respond to requests from users.

7) The X Window System will henceforth be known as the NC-17 Window
System.

8) And finally, UNIX itself will be renamed "PC" - for Procreatively
Challenged.

7--"Guido, the Cyber-Bodyguard" (press release)

              Privacy, Inc. Unveils its Internet Background Check,
                     Announces 'Guido, the Cyber-Bodyguard'

Aurora, Colorado, August 1, 1997
Privacy, Inc. (www.privacyinc.com) today released its Internet Background
Check, a utility that empowers users to determine if they are at risk from
the plethora of databases that are being placed on the Internet.  Searches
quickly scan through hundreds of databases beng placed on-line by state and
local governments and law enforcement angencies in categories such as:
   * Registered Sex Offenders and Predators
   * Deadbeat Parents
   * Wanted Persons
   * Missing Persons
   * Arrest/Prison

'The Computer Is Never Wrong'

"Errors and risks of mistaken identity in this data are a key concern," says
Edward Allburn, founder and president of Privacy, Inc.  The recent flurry of
activity by government and law enforcement agencies to distribute such
volatile information on the Internet creates an environment that potentially
places innocent people at risk, especially for mistaken identity.

Advanced technology was incorporated into the development of the Internet
Background Check with this risk in mind.  This technology allows users to
also search for names that look and/or sound similar to their own while still
delivering highly focused results that standard Internet search engines
(such as Yahoo! and Lycos) are incapable of producing.

One More Tool

The release provides one more tool for consumers to protect themselves in the
Information Age.  Additional resources provided by Privacy, Inc. include:
   * Consumer Privacy Guide
   * Government Database Guide
   * Government Dossier Service
   * David Sobel's Legal FAQ
   * Privacy News Archive, updated weekly

Guido, the Cyber-Bodyguard is another utility planned to be released in the
coming months.  Guido will interface with the Internet Background Check to
automatically alert users via e-mail if/when their name appears in a new or
updated database, in effect monitoring the Internet so users don't have to.

About Privacy, Inc.

Privacy, Inc. was founded in 1996 with initial funding by Nicholas Negroponte,
the Founding Director of the MIT Media Lab and also an early backer and Senior
Columnist of "Wired" magazine.

Also providing their expertise to Privacy, Inc. are long-time privacy veterans
Evan Hendricks, editor of the "Privacy Times" newsletter
