FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT &
CALL FOR PAPERS

International Congress on Intellectual Property Rights for
Specialized Information, Knowledge and New Technologies

organized by
Austrian Computer Society, Austrian national commission for
UNESCO, Vienna University of Technology, TermNet

sponsored by
IFIP - CEPIS - UNIDO - ISO - FID
21 - 25 August 1995
Vienna, Austria

AIMS

Computer hardware and software technology increasingly
allows us to record and process complex information and
knowledge simultaneously in various languages and in
different forms of representation. The exponential growth of
information and knowledge requires more and more
sophisticated computer applications including especially
technologies, networking and multimedia.

In the course of these developments the borderlines between
computer hardware (in particular storage media) and software
(in particular application software) on the one hand and
data, texts and other forms of representation of information
and knowledge on the other hand have become blurred. The
increasingly unrestricted possibilities to manipulate
representations of information and knowledge make it
difficult to distinguish clearly between the original and
its offspring. Moreover, the transfer of information via
information highways will require legal and organizational
means to assist the transfer of related rights.

Research on and development of information and knowledge
systems abound everywhere in the world. New - multilingual -
communication media and databases are created which lead to
an increased need for new access, retrieval and interaction
methods. However, the methodology how to manage complex
information structures lags behind the development of
information technology itself.

In this context the legal provisions concerning the
protection of intellectual property rights are still based
on traditional hardcopy-oriented technology. New
representation methods and technologies are not sufficiently
covered by these provisions. Information users and customers
may welcome this development claiming that specialized
information and knowledge is the intellectual property of
all mankind. But the originators of specialized information
and knowledge may be highly interested in the utmost
protection of their intellectual property. These two
diametrically different positions mark the span of attitudes
towards the protection of intellectual property rights
today.

Increasingly, information and knowledge are created in
international cooperation networks through the division of
labour and shared efforts transcending national borders.
National legislation and jurisdiction concerning
intellectual property, however, show substantial
discrepancies and are equally insufficient everywhere. This
calls for harmonization at international level especially
addressing European cooperation and also developing
countries.

Legal measures, however, do not suffice. Technical methods
and tools - not to mention ethics - have to contribute to
the solution of the problems outlined above. There is
definitely the need for a congress with an interdisciplinary
and integrative approach at international level dealing with
the highly complex and unsatisfactory situation with regard
to intellectual property for specialized information and
knowledge in order to prepare the grounds for adequate
solutions.

                          December 27th to 29th, 1994

                       in the former art exhibition hall,
                           Berlin, Budapester Str. 42
                       (opposite the Gedaechtnis-Kirche)

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        The Chaos Communication Congress, organized by the Chaos Computer
        Club and traditionally taking place  between  Christmas  and  New
        Year,  will  this  year  again  be  offering a lot of interesting
        issues for the hitchhikers on  the  data  highway  and  everybody
        else.

        After taking place  in  Hamburg  for  10  years,  this  year  the
        congress opens itself, in terms of both content and structure, to
        a larger public, and will be held in the  former  art  exhibition
        hall,  right in the center of Berlin's city, on Breitscheidplatz,
        opposite the Gedaechtnis-Kirche.

        Now that computers have turned out to be the most  important  new
        medium,  questions  of  conception of this new medium (which will
        even overtake TV in importance) are gaining more and more  social
        relevance.

        Terms such as "interactive TV" should  contain  much  more  than
        just  a  "buy" button on the remote control (which persuades you
        to buy any product you see in the commercials). To achieve this,
        visions  are   needed.  Thanks  to  their  self-created,  freely
        accessible computer  networks  which  can  offer  a   lot   more
        speaking   of "interactivity", the hackers do not only reach the
        childrens' rooms in the information  society,   but   also   get
        into  difficulties   caused   by  large  combines  that are more
        and more regarding the networks as a field  of   activity.   The
        industry's  tending   to   lay  a  direct glass fibre connection
        right into our wallets and the commercialization of  information
        ways   involved  threatens  organizations  that  have  a  social
        interest, such as environmental or human  rights  organizations,
        parties,   or  trade unions,   whose  aims  are not in the first
        place financial ones.

        Topical issues, like the demonopolization of the german telephone
        network and the conception  of  future  network  structures,  can
        therefore  be  found  on  the  program as well as the traditional
        workshops and hearings. This year, the discussion and analysis of
        industrial concepts, next to the presentation of own projects and
        ideas, will be paid special attention to.

%
        Under the title "Let me embrace  you,  millions"  workshops  and
        discussions  concerning  the financial outlook of the electronic
        networks will be offered. Vebacom? RWE? Who will earn  the  most
        out  of  the glass fibre pipelines with their endlessly flushing
        greyish gold consisting of bits and bytes? Will anyone  be  able
        to  afford  to  take part in free public networks and world-wide
        communication for individuals, small companies and institutions?
        This  looks like a simple numeric problem, but in reality, it is
        a socio-political calculation, in which the phrase "knowledge is
        power"  might change to a "You're only supposed to know what you
        can afford" - freedom of information might become freedom to buy
        information.  The  exchange  of values via electronic money will
        also be a subject to examination in some of the many  workshops.

        The actual lifeline of  the  congress,  the  information  chaos,
        structured   in   different   workshops,   but  as  well  beyond
        organization, in every hallway and especially  the  Chaos  Cafe,
        can  only be summarized in some topical keywords, such as CD ROM
        security, phone phreaking and ISDN, secret service  recruitments
        in  the  german  computer  &  network  scene,  police raids that
        occurred at BBS operators' homes during the last year because of
        "disturbance of the public harmony", legal information about the
        BTX  (german  videotext  system)  providers'  possibilities  and
        restrictions,  and  about the telecommunications law, insecurity
        of chip cards and the  questions  resulting  from  it...  Should
        there not be enough time, the 30th of December will be available
        for further spontaneous actions.

        To keep the congress as easy to understand as possible in  terms
        of  technical  jargon,  there  will be introductory workshops on
        some issues, e.g. the Internet.

        The Hack-center and the data filling stations in every room will
        be  offering  the  possibility  of  critical and creative use of
        technology. For reading and making decentral backup  copys,  the
        Chaos Archive will provide a wide range of literature and enough
        photocopiers.

Subject: File 3--The Cu in the News (Beehive BBS; Fed Virus Laws, & More)

Beehive BBS
==========
A BBS sponsored by the State of Utah has flooded with users since
going online in May. The board averages about 300 calls a day and
allows citizens to send email to the governor and state regulators. At
first, Governor Michael Leavitt responded to email personally, but
that task is now handled by the same folks who respond to paper
correspondence. The BBS runs PCBoard software (from Utah-based Clark
Development Co.) and is gatewayed with the email system used by the
State's employees. In addition to email, citizens can access state job
openings, press releases, speeches, and consumer information. The
number for the BBS is toll-free throughout the state.
(Computerworld. Nov 7, 1994. pg 64)

Federal Virus Laws
==============
The Clinton Crime Bill makes it illegal to transmit computer viruses
and worms over the nation's electronic networks. The law also
introduces two levels of computer crime: those taken with "reckless
disregard" are misdemeanors, while "intentional" acts are felonies.
Other sections of the crime bill prohibit state motor vehicle agencies
from selling personal information from their databases.

Help by Email
===========
"The Samaritans", a  non-religious charity that offers help to the suicidal
and despairing, can now be reached via the Internet. Volunteer counselors
respond to mail every day.  Send your messages to joe@samaritans.org, or
samaritans@anon.penet.fi for anonymous messaging.
(Datamation. Oct. 1, 1994 pg 22)

Not Our Fault
===========
The International Business Association (IBA), a D.C. based trade group,
advocates that the same Constitutional standards that apply to booksellers
be applied to BBS sysops and information carriers. In other words, just as
a bookstore owner is not responsible for the content of the books they
sell, neither should a sysop by liable for the contents of their board.
(Datamation. Oct. 1, 1994)

Fanning the Flames
===============
While most people have grown complacent, even amused, at the so-called
"virus crisis" the media keeps screaming about, Windows Magazine's Rich
Castagna writes that virus writers are still smart, still mean, and still
out to get you. He describes the situation as "corporate terrorism" in
the making. His column ends with a nice even-handed pitch for all the
commercial anti-virus software that is advertised in his magazine.
(Windows Magazine. December, 1994. pgs 79 - 82)

Attached is the table of contents and the Foreword by Phil Zimmermann
for my book on PGP. It arrived in the publisher's warehouse last Thursday,
and should be in bookstores in a few days. It will take longer for the
book to be available overseas; the fastest and probably cheapest way to
get it is from a US bookstore or distributor such as NCSA
(75300.2557@compuserve.com).

Foreword by Philip Zimmermann

This book is about Pretty Good Privacy, a program I created to
encrypt e-mail using public key cryptography. PGP was
electronically published as free software in 1991. Little did I
realize what this project would lead to. PGP has become the
worldwide de facto standard for e-mail encryption.
I've admired Bill Stallings's writings in computer science for
some years before PGP, and here he is writing a book about my
program. How can I talk about how great his book is, without, by
implication, talking about how great PGP is? It's hard to write a
foreword for his book about PGP without sliding into some
measure of self-indulgence.
I've been so close to this project for so long that I sometimes
lose sight of the scope of what PGP provides. I got the manuscript
for Bill's book in the mail the other day -- the book you are
holding. Sitting down with it, flipping through it, endless pages of
diagrams, the formal treatment of it, services provided by PGP. It
wasn't till I saw his book on PGP that I could step back and see
PGP as others see it. The breadth of it. As a software engineer,
I'm used to either documenting my own software, or having a
random company tech writer document it. All software
engineers get that. But having William Stallings do the manual
for your software -- it's sort of like having your portrait done by
a world-class artist.
There are a very small number of software packages that
have far-reaching political implications. Most software that fits in
such an influential category has negative effects on our civil
liberties. For example, government intelligence agencies use a
software package called PROMIS, which is a powerful tool of
governments to track people's activities, movements, spending,
political affiliations, et cetera. Now that is a piece of software with
far-reaching political implications. Mostly bad ones. Then there is
the software that the Medical Information Bureau uses to classify
people who file medical insurance claims, to put them on a
medical "black list", so that they cannot purchase any medical
insurance ever again. That software has far-reaching political
implications -- enough to raise a large-scale backlash in our
society to do something about it. In most cases, it seems that
software that has powerful political effects is software designed to
strengthen the strong and weaken the weak.
But PGP also has far-reaching political implications. Mostly
good ones. In the Information Age, cryptography affects the
power relationship between government and its people. The
Government knows this all too well, as evidenced by their recent
policy initiatives for the Clipper chip, which would give the
Government a back door into all our private communications --
an Orwellian "wiretap chip" built into all our telephones, fax
machines and computer networks. PGP strikes a blow against
such dark trends, and has become a crystal nucleus for the
growth of the Crypto Revolution, a new political movement for
privacy and civil liberties in the Information Age.  This
government has done all they can to stop the emergence of a
worldwide encryption standard that they don't have a back door
into. And that same government has placed me under criminal
investigation for unleashing this free software on the world. If
indicted and convicted, I would face 41 to 51 months in a federal
prison.
Despite the pressure the Government has brought to bear
against PGP (or perhaps because of it), PGP has become the most
widely used software in the world for e-mail encryption, used by
a variety of activists, and anyone else needing protection from
the powerful. It's also used by ordinary people to protect their
personal and business communications from prying eyes.
PGP may have a future as an official Internet standard, as
the Internet Engineering Task Force develops an interest in it. No
one who wants to work in the area of Internet e-mail privacy
should neglect studying PGP. Because of the "fax machine effect",
more people who want to encrypt their e-mail are getting PGP
because everyone else who encrypts their e-mail is already
using it.
Naturally, I want people to read the Official PGP User's
Guide, which comes with the electronic distribution package of
PGP (also in book form from MIT Press), because I wrote it. Also,
I'm more entertaining and personable in my book. And more
political. But Bill Stallings' book is more comprehensive than
mine, more thorough, covering more detail, with a lot more
diagrams. He's really good at completely nailing it down in a book.
In fact, I'll probably use his book myself as my preferred
reference to PGP.

Join the international conversation:

CPSR-GLOBAL is a moderated Listserv for uniting people all over the world
who want to talk about:

**decisions the USA will make on the information infrastructure,
or NII,  that will affect the rest of the world--we want the NII to be
a positive force for a GII (global information infrastructure)

**issues of national identity, "cultural pollution," and
international communication and the GII

**the new emerging GII world culture

**international issues of security and privacy and  computer law

**international issues of computer development (keyboards, safety)

**issues of design

**language

And whatever other global issues you want to discuss.  Right now
the list will be predominately in English, because it's the lingua
franca of the Net.  It is a MODERATED list.  That means any
posts which are not "on topic" or inflammatory will be filtered out.
You can tell our messages because of the (@) in the subject line.
