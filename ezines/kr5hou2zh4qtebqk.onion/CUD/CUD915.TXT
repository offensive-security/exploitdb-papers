Gabriel Hatcher's reply seem to be a form letter. I received an
identical letter last week when I wrote to him complaining about
the FACE project.  Clearly, he is not concerned with mounting an
adequate defence of his actions. As far as his protestations of
legality go, such acts are specifically prohibited in the UK
under section 97 of the Children's Act 1989. I suppose the law in
America is different.

I think the CyberAngels FACE scheme is pretty well thought out, but I do
wonder if they quite realise the implications of the international
nature of the Internet.

There are, I suggest, two main problems.

First, different countries do have different laws.  Here in the UK, the
definition of paedophile material has a lower age limit than in the USA,
although the CyberAngels are setting a cut-off point of 15, which would
also be illegal here.  Perhaps more important are the way in which UK
law makes 'faked' images as illegal as the real stuff, and the
protections in law for the victims in sex cases.  The FACE database, if
published, would be at risk from such protection laws.

The second problem is that the scheme depends on an Internet user who
looks at the database, and recognises somebody.  There are going to be
false alarms.  It's even possible that many of these victims are not
known to _any_ Internet user.  Here in the UK there have been several
major cases of alleged "satanic child abuse" which have eventually
collapsed, with dreadful effects on the innocent families involved.  I
don't want to see paedophiles escape, but I do know of the harm that can
be done by a witch hunt.

And, frankly, I find the average of 80 victims per paedophile, suggested
by the CyberAngels, rather difficult to believe.  I hope they can
provide a good source for this claim.  According to reports in the UK,
most cases are within a family, and this figure suggests that other
cases could routinely involve a couple of hundred victims.  Since the
"satanic ritual abuse" scares started in the USA, and  have turned out
to be largely unfounded here in the UK, I'm afraid that I tend to be
sceptical.

But if they can gather information that leads to a paedophile, without
provoking the persecution of innocent families, it will be something
wonderful, that they can be justly proud of.

Subject: File 3--CYBERANGELS FACE PROJECT

A response to Colin Hatcher's letter to CuD:

As a reader and occassional contributor to CuD, I find your
characterization of CuD as a place where demonization occurs
quite insulting. Indeed, it indicates that neither you nor your
organization is responsive to criticism on ethical grounds. (I
suspect my posting to CuD regarding your monitoring scheme may
have contributed to your negative feelings regarding CuD; I will
clarify my statements by that I was not advocating mail-bombing
the CyberAngels, but simply that you would better serve the
Internet community by concentrating on actual problems such as
spam.)

To the degree that "do-gooder" is treated negatively on CuD, it
is because of such phenomena as "we're from the government and
we're here to help you." Only organizations (e.g., the Red Cross)
with a history of competent, helpful action should be free from
this suspicion; neither the CyberAngels nor their parent
organization the Guardian Angels match this description.
Cooperation between the CyberAngels and such government
organizations

Another example of why the CyberAngels are not so trusted can be
found in your claim that you should report any possible child
pornography, even if it may be innocent (e.g., morphed), by
asking if the person would do away with laws against child
pornography. First, your statement shows an ignoring of the
principle that letting the guilty go free is preferable to
punishing the innocent - a principle found in all free legal
systems. While your reporting of an event does not result in and
of itself in direct judicial punishment, the investigation of
child pornography production (like that for other emotion-charged
crimes) is noticeably harrassing in and of itself. When you bring
such harrassment (potentially including tabloid media
involvement) on an innocent person, you are ethically if not
legally to blame. An example of such a case (albeit not resulting
from CyberAngel action, so far as I know) can be found in the
same CuDigest as your article. Second, removing the possibility
of prosecution for possibly morphed images does not remove the
possibility of prosecution for the _production_ of child
pornography - the only phase in which a child is being actually
harmed. The claim that limits on free speech and freedom of the
press regarding the distribution or possession of child
pornography are necessary to prevent its creation is negated by
phenomena on the Internet such as copyright violations. Quite
simply, I find it highly unlikely that most persons paying for
the reception of child pornography are paying money (directly or
indirectly) to the producers of such material. Therefore, the
remaining illegality of such possession or distribution can only
be attributed to "do-gooder" intrusion of their morality on
others, a fault for which politicians are often to blame. Given
this consideration, I would therefore regard the CyberAngel
search for "probable cause" (in this and in other cases) in about
the same light as the encouraging of informing on one's neighbor
in totalitarian states such as the USSR under Communism; while I
am not in favor of making such behavior illegal (it is free
speech, something that I wish to protect), I certainly find it
ultimately unethical.

I would like again to encourage the CyberAngels to concentrate on
matters directly harmful to the Internet, such as the
aforementioned spams. While you may claim that your activities
are necessary to prevent governmental infringement (such as the
CDA) on the rights of Internet users, I find this claim
reminiscent of self-censorship resulting from threats of
governmental censorship. Moreover, reporting information to the
goverment cannot be described as discouraging government
involvement and regulation.

Subject: File 4--CyberAngles Faces project: CuD #9.14, Sun Mar 2, 1997

In Mr Hatcher's posts to CuD, he has repeatedly stated the
importance of stopping child pornographers and child abusers.
His proposed method is to identify the child victims of the
pornographer and abusers and used these children to identify the
people many of us would like to remove from the streets.

Many of the complaints about his method, hinge on the fact that
identifying victims ignores the wishes of the victims and perhaps
even their rights.  Mr. Hatcher responds that "ending the abuse"
is the goal that should be pre-eminent in our minds.

Here's another take, from the victims.  Mr Hatcher, the victims
that you want to save do not want to be publicly identified.  If
there is any possible way for the identities of the victims to be
released beyond the official Law Enforcement channels, and the
CyberAngels are NOT in that group, then the CyberAngels may face
suits by the identified victims for damages to their reputation.

Why?  Let me set the scenario.  Recently here in Canada, which has
slightly stronger laws against child pornography than in the States
it has been recently realized that a "child sexual abuse" ring worked
out of the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.  The Maple Leaf Gardens is a
large hockey arena in downtown Toronto.

Today, The Globe and Mail published the following article:

    Victims of sexual assaults went public, feel punished

    DEEP SCARS / After suffering as boys and teens, two men
    complain they can't find support and are unfairly painted
    as potential abusers.

    Wednesday, March 5, 1997
    By Jane Gadd
    The Globe and Mail

http://www.globeandmail.com/docs/news/19970305/GlobeFront/UVICTN.html

I'll let you examine the content of the article yourself.  To
summarize:

  - All sexual abusers were sexually abused themselves.
  - Society is very afraid of (potential) sexual abusers.
  - Society is thus very afraid of sexual abuse victims.

  - But, only 7% of sexual abuse victims go on to become
    sexual abusers.

An example taken from the article:

    Eric...was sexually molested beginning at the age of 9 by his
    stepfather's father. His visits to the man, and sexual relations,
    continued until Eric was 15, when he told his mother. She called
    the police, and his abuser was jailed for 10 years on numerous
    counts of sexual assault.

    Eric recalled the first visit: It was a winter evening, and his
    stepfather took him to visit the old man, leaving him there
    overnight. "I didn't know him. It was bedtime and he had a
    pullout couch. I remember him sitting beside me and saying
    everything was okay. And then he took my pants off."

    That first time, the sex was one-way--Eric submitted to caresses
    from the older man. But over the following six years he was drawn
    into full reciprocal sexual acts.

    "I have a tremendous amount of guilt and shame for staying in the
    relationship," he said. "What I remember is I didn't want the
    sexual relationship . . . but I wanted the companionship of a
    father-figure to do all the normal father-son things with--going
    to movies and arcades, shopping, things like that. He took me to
    work with him, and he let me drive even though I was too young. I
    felt he was the one person who cared about me."

    After his abuser was jailed, Eric buried the issue for close to
    10 years.

    "I don't remember any counselling. I was given a
    pamphlet. . . . The police asked me if I had felt any serious
    effects from the relationship, and I said 'No, I have a
    girlfriend. I just want to put it behind me.' "

    The woman he married was sympathetic when he told her about the
    abuse shortly after the relationship began. But since then, the
    marriage has broken up and his former wife has withheld access to
    his two sons on the grounds that Eric is at risk of being a child
    abuser.

So say that Eric's abuser had taken photographs and had uploaded
them to the Internet, and thanks to the Faces project Eric's
abuser had been arrested.  Eric went on to get consulting, and
had not told his wife that he was a victim of sexual abuse.  She
then found out through the Faces project that he had been a
victim and thus had her laywer argue in court for controlled
access to her AND his children because he was a child abuse
victim, and MAY become a child abuser [note the 7% figure
above for victims becoming perpetrators].

Eric would have grounds IMHO to sue the CyberAngels and all law
enforcement agencies associated with the release of his sexual
abuse victim status for damages to his reputation.

Perhaps the writer means exactly what they said: i.e. that your project
is dim-witted and ill thought out. Obviously they disagree with it, but
I think that using these words conveys rather more than simple
disagreement.  Let's face it... this is an emotional issue, and emotions
are going to run high on both sides.

The fact that your project is dim-witted and ill thought out does not
necessarily imply that you lack intelligence--mere intelligence does not
automatically guarantee that one will embark on appropriate courses of
action.

Not at all. Possession of child pornography is illegal, regardless of
the purpose for which it is held.  In child pornography cases here in
Canada, I understand that even defence counsel must go to the offices of
the police to view the evidence--even counsel for the accused is not
permitted to either possess or view the evidence except though the
police.

To a degree, is this not true?  Are you not, in fact, exploiting them in
order to further your own political agendas?  (I see your agendas as
cracking down on encryption, key-escrow, anonymity and general policing
of the Net. Please correct me if you are not, in fact, in favour of all
of these measures.)

This is an entirely reasonable assumption.

This next statement, however, is not.  You are operating under the
assumption that the current materials making the rounds of the net are
in fact, current--when this is necessarily not the case.  Quite a bit of
it has been scanned in from materials published decades ago.

Consider the following:

     From: "Tracking high-tech pedophiles"

     "Project P has also offered hope to people who have memories of
     being abused as children and believe it was recorded on film, or to
     parents who fear their children were assaulted by pedophiles. Every
     week Staff Sgt. Matthews gets letters accompanied by photographs of
     children asking whether investigators have seen them on the
     Internet, with the hope that they can identify the abusers.

     The smiling faces of these children, posing in class photographs or
     hamming it up in photo booths, are posted above the computer that
     is printing out the images of child pornography in Project P's back
     room. The investigators say it's almost impossible to look for
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     matches among the hundreds of printouts a day, but they like to
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     have the photos posted there as a reminder of the innocent victims
     hurt by the trade in such material."

Read the above, Gabriel.  Even the officer in charge of "Project P" the
largest unit dedicated to fighting child pornography in North America,
is of the opinion that your methods aren't 't workable.  The odds of
your actually "saving" a child are therefore negligible.

Granted.  However, as stated in the article above, even the head of
Project P apparently regards your methods as unworkable.

I must commend you, however--you are one of the only persons engaged in
the fight against child pornography who has *ever* raised the fact that
the overwhelming majority of abuse takes place in families.  (My
understanding is that very little, if any, of this material makes it
onto the net.)

This may be true, in theory--in practice it is another thing
entirely--witness Staff Sgt. Matthew's comments in the Globe and Mail
article above.

Actually, U.S. law if fairly lenient.  The laws here in Canada are *far*
stricter, even covering artificial child pornography (morphed or
hand-drawn images, and even *text*.  It is my understanding that there
is a bill by a Senator Hatch which would also criminalize artificial
child pornography in the U.S.A., although your 1st Amendment would
continue to protect expression in text form, as it should.)

As I said, Canadian law makes no such distinctions, which is the primary
reason I am opposed to it.  Senator Hatch's legislation would also
change this state of affairs.

All of these judgments are highly subjective--how the hell are you
supposed to differentiate a 15-year-old from a 16-year-old?  (I know
women that are well into their twenties, yet they tell me they're often
asked for I.D. going into bars, as they appear to be about 13-14.)

Under Canadian law, even the morphing of an image to make it appear that
the person depicted is underage (or even describing them as underage,
even if they are not, makes the image or text child pornography.)

Direct sexual abuse, masturbation (or insertion of an object into the
anus or vagina) I think I can agree with.  However, the term `overtly
sexual nature' is rather broad, and subject to wide interpretation.

If you had your way, would you have this changed under U.S. law?

A question, if I may--why the exclusion of images involving pain or
distress?  (Does this somehow make the child's face harder to identify?)

Who are the members of this selection committee, and what are their
qualifications?  How were they selected, and by whom?

The problem is, that the existence of decent morphing software breaks
the link between the production of child pornography and the abuse of
actual children.  It is no longer necessary to abuse an actual child to
produce such images.  Accordingly, there is not always an actual
victimized child to "rescue."

Really, now.  You admitted above, that your 5-member committee judges
whether to pass along an image to the police or not.  You are already,
ipso facto, making judgments about the legality or illegality of
images.  If you were truly making no judgments, you would pass along
either *all* of the images, or *none*.

Are any of the people on your "selection committee" qualified to make
such legal or forensic judgments?  If not, then you have no business to
be making them.

And how is this to be determined, exactly?  If a child's picture is
published, then the parents (and the child themselves) essentially lose
any control over its use.

The only reasonable course of action is to make the assumption that you
are unqualified, unless and until, you prove otherwise.

Irrelevant.  Given the nature of this medium, anyone can claim to be
anyone, or have any qualifications they wish in this forum.  I could
just as easily claim to be an M.D., Ph.D. or a pink elephant for that
matter.

The difference, my dear Gabriel, is that experts who testify in court
have to submit some sort of evidence as to their qualifications, in
order for them to be accepted as experts by the court.  Your `experts'
do not. We have only your word for it.  Care to name some of your
CyberAngels or the people who have been advising you?

Good thing you're in the U.S.  In Canada, this would tend to
automatically one make liable to charges of both making and possessing
child pornography, under Section 163.1 of the Criminal Code.

Fine and good.  However, given the relatively rapid expiration times of
binary newsgroups, and the fact that (at least to my knowledge) none of
the archiving services store intact binaries, what is the point?

So, you destroy the actual `evidence'.

How is verification performed, given the constraints I've listed above?
What is there to link a particular image with a particular set of
headers?  Are you not essentially, breaking the chain of evidence here?

       by email or snail mail.

No doubt, this is to try and avoid charges of distribution... fair
enough.

The encoded binary is downloaded to floppy disk from where?  Above, you
stated that: " No suspected illegal images are EVER stored on computer,
nor sent by email or snail mail."  So, where *are* you getting them
from?

Further, how can you ensure that the images downloaded are identical to
those identified by the headers, particularly if they are not decoded?

Then you wouldn't mind publishing a membership list of the various

Just out of curiosity, are you aware of any Canadians who have
approached either the Ontario Provincial Police (the OPP is responsible
for Project "P") or the RCMP?

If so, what was their response?

Even though I am opposed to what you are doing, nevertheless, I believe
that you are correct here.  I think that the probability of such an
occurrence is extremely remote.

Are you claiming then, that all of your CyberAngels (engaged in this
project at least) have submitted themselves to (and passed) background
checks by law-enforcement officials?

Furthermore, you state that pedophiles, `can obtain child pornography
freely and safely'; Staff Sgt. Matthews, the head of Project P, has made
statements to the effect that methods (essentially identical to the ones
you are using) to identify abuse victims are unworkable.  So, therefore,
what is the point of the project?

I'm not entirely certain about American law, but under Canadian law,
even storage of an image to a floppy disk is illegal.  I must admit to
being disturbed by your admission that you seek to act as `official
agents for the FBI.' My belief is that you and your CyberAngels are
nothing more than a bunch of cyber-vigilantes.

Your expertise, Sir, not to mention that of your colleagues, has yet to

Something can be very carefully planned and thought out, yet still be
dim-witted, or ill-advised.

Ok, so you mean you've already *started* the project, without reaching a
decision as to all the legal, moral and other implications?!

If that isn't dim-witted or ill-advised, what is?
