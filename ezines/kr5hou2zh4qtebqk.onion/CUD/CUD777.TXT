The following memo can be found at:
        http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/memo.txt

As a resident of Minnesota, I have a great concern over how far this
inturrpretation can go.  The AA BBS case seems to be ripe for repeat
under this, as can any other law that diffes between Minnesota and
another state.  This is bad, IMHO.

I have deleted a small amount of white space, otherwise the memo is exact
as it appears on the web page.

================

           WARNING TO ALL INTERNET USERS AND PROVIDERS

    THIS MEMORANDUM SETS  FORTH  THE  ENFORCEMENT POSITION OF THE
MINNESOTA  ATTORNEY  GENERAL'S  OFFICE  WITH  RESPECT  TO CERTAIN
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON THE INTERNET.

    PERSONS OUTSIDE OF MINNESOTA WHO TRANSMIT INFORMATION VIA THE
INTERNET  KNOWING  THAT  INFORMATION   WILL  BE  DISSEMINATED  IN
MINNESOTA ARE SUBJECT  TO  JURISDICTION  IN  MINNESOTA COURTS FOR
VIOLATIONS OF STATE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS.

    The following discussion sets  out  the  legal basis for this
conclusion.

    Minnesota's general criminal jurisdiction statute provides as
follows:

         A person may be  convicted  and sentenced under the
    law of this State if the person:

         (1) Commits an offense in  whole  or in part within
    this state; or

         (2) Being without the state,  causes, aids or abets
    another to commit a crime within the state; or

         (3) Being without the state, intentionally causes a
    result within the state  prohibited by the criminal laws
    of this state.

         It is not a defense that the defendant's conduct is
    also a criminal offense under  the laws of another state
    or of the United States or of another country.

Minnesota Statute Section 609.025 (1994).

    This statute has  been  interpreted  by the Minnesota Supreme
Court.  In State v.  Rossbach,  288  N.W.2d 714 (Minn. 1980), the
defendant appealed his  conviction  for  aggravated assault.  The
defendant, standing inside the  border  of an Indian Reservation,
had fired a rifle across  the  boundary  line at a person outside
the border.  The defendant  claimed that Minnesota courts did not
have jurisdiction because  his  act  took  place off of Minnesota
lands.  Applying Minnesota Statute  { 609.025 and the common law,
the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that
the   intentional   impact    within   Minnesota   land   created
jurisdiction.  Id. at 715-16.

    The Minnesota Court of  Appeals  reached  a similar result in
State v. Brown, 486 N.W.2d 816  (Minn. Ct. App. 1992).  In Brown,
the court implicitly  found  that  Minnesota  courts had criminal
jurisdiction  over  individuals  in  Iowa  who  mailed unlicensed
gambling equipment to Minnesota residents.  Id. at 817-18.






    Minnesota   courts   have   applied   similar  jurisdictional
principles in civil cases.   In  State v. Red Lake DFL Committee,
303 N.W.2d 54 (Minn. 1981), the Minnesota Supreme Court held that
state courts had jurisdiction  over  a  committee of the Red Lake
Indian   Tribe   which   had   purchased   space   for  political
advertisements in a newspaper circulated  in the state.  At issue
was whether the  committee  had  to  register under state ethical
practices laws.

    The committee argued that it  had done nothing outside of the
reservation, since the transaction  with the newspaper took place
inside the reservation, and the  committee  did not assist in the
circulation of the newspaper.   In holding that the committee was
required to  register  under  state  ethical  practices  law, the
Supreme Court responded to this argument as follows:

    Defendants say  nothing  they  did  occurred outside the
    reservation, but they  choose  to  ignore that what they
    did caused  something  to  occur  beyond the reservation
    boundaries, namely,  the  dissemination  of  a political
    message,  which  is  the  activity  here  sought  to  be
    regulated.

Id. at 56 (emphasis added).

    The  above  principles  of  Minnesota  law  apply  equally to
activities  on  the  Internet.    Individuals  and  organizations
outside of Minnesota who disseminate information in Minnesota via
the Internet and thereby cause a result to occur in Minnesota are
subject to state criminal and civil laws.

An Example Of Illegal Activity On The Internet - Gambling

    Gambling appears  to  be  an  especially  prominent aspect of
criminal activity  on  the  Internet.    There  are  a  number of
services outside of Minnesota  that offer Minnesota residents the
opportunity to place  bets  on  sporting events, purchase lottery
tickets,  and  participate  in  simulated  casino  games.   These
services are illegal in Minnesota.

Lotteries

    A lottery  is  defined  as  "a  plan  which  provides for the
distribution of money,  property  or  other  reward or benefit to
persons selected by chance from among participants some or all of
whom  have  given  a  consideration   for  the  chance  of  being
selected."   Minnesota  Statute  Section 609.75, Subdivision 1(a)
(1994).

    Generally, it is unlawful in  Minnesota to sell or transfer a
chance to participate in  a  lottery.   Minnesota Statute Section
609.755(2)  (1994).     It   is   also  unlawful  to  disseminate
information  in  Minnesota  about  a  lottery,  except  a lottery
conducted  by  an  adjoining  state,  with  intent  to  encourage


                               -2-





participation therein.    Minnesota  Statute  Section 609.755(3).
Acts in Minnesota in  furtherance  of a lottery conducted outside
of Minnesota  are  included,  notwithstanding  its validity where
conducted.   Minnesota  Statute  Section 609.75, Subdivision 1(c)
(1994).    Violation  of   these  provisions  is  a  misdemeanor,
punishable by up to 90 days in jail,  or a fine of up to $700, or
both.    Minnesota   Statute   Section  609.755  (1994);  609.02,
Subdivision 3 (1994).  It is  a gross misdemeanor under Minnesota
law to conduct  a  lottery.    Minnesota  Statute Section 609.76,
Subdivision 1(3) (1994).  A gross misdemeanor is punishable by up
to one year  in  jail,  or  a  $3,000  fine,  or both.  Minnesota
Statute Section 609.02, Subdivision 4 (1994).








                               -3-





Sports Bookmaking

    Sports   bookmaking   is   defined   as   "the   activity  of
intentionally  receiving,  recording  or  forwarding  within  any
30-day period more than five  bets,  or offers to bet, that total
more than $2,500 on any one  or more sporting events."  Minnesota
Statute Section 609.75, Subdivision 7 (1994).  Engaging in sports
bookmaking is a felony, which is punishable by more than one year
imprisonment.  Minnesota Statutes  Sections 609.76, Subdivision 2
(1994); 609.02, Subdivision  2  (1994).  Intentionally receiving,
recording, or forwarding bets or  offers to bet in lesser amounts
is  a  gross  misdemeanor.    Minnesota  Statute  Section 609.76,
Subdivision 1(7) (1994).

Accomplice Liability

    Minnesota's  accomplice   statute   provides   that  one  who
intentionally aids, advises, counsels,  or conspires with another
to commit a crime is  equally  liable  for that crime.  Minnesota
Statute Section 609.05, Subdivision 1 (1994).  Therefore, persons
or  organizations   who   knowingly   assist   Internet  gambling
organizations in any  unlawful  activity  may  themselves be held
liable for that unlawful  activity.   Thus, for example, Internet
access providers  and  credit  card  companies  that  continue to
provide services to gambling  organizations after notice that the
activities of the organizations  are  illegal would be subject to
accomplice liability.

    In  addition  to  being  illegal  under  Minnesota  law,  the
Internet  gambling  organizations   appear   to  violate  several
provisions of the federal  law.    All  of the services appear to
violate 18 United States  Code  Section 1084, which prohibits the
foreign  or  interstate  transmission   of   bets  or  wagers  or
information on bets or wagers by use of a wire communication.  In
as much as the Internet gambling organizations involve lotteries,
they would also appear to  violate  18 United States Code Section
1301 (prohibiting  the  "importing  or  transporting"  of lottery
tickets; 18  United  States  Code  Section  1302 (prohibiting the
mailing of lottery tickets);  and  18  United States Code Section
1304 (prohibiting  the  "broadcasting"  of  lottery information).
Sections 1084 and 1301  provide for felony-level penalties, while
Sections 1302 and 1304 provide for misdemeanor penalties.

Placing A Bet Through Internet Gambling Organizations

    Minnesota residents should be  aware  that  it is unlawful to
make a bet  through  Internet  gambling organizations.  Minnesota
law makes it a misdemeanor to place a bet unless done pursuant to
an  exempted,   state-regulated   activity,   such   as  licensed
charitable gambling  or  the  state  lottery.   Minnesota Statute
Sections 609.75,  Subdivisions 2  -  3;  609.755(1)  (1994).  The
Internet gambling organizations are not exempted.  Therefore, any
person in  Minnesota  who  places  a  bet  through  one  of these
organizations is committing a crime.


                               -4-






    Minnesota  residents  should  also  be  aware  of  forfeiture
provisions related  to  unlawful  gambling  activity.   Minnesota
Statute Section 609.762, Subdivision  1  (1994) provides that the
following items are subject to forfeiture:

         (a)  Devices used  or  intended  for use, including
    those defined in  section  349.30,  subdivision  2, as a
    gambling device, except as authorized in sections 349.11
    to 349.23 and 349.40;

         (b)  All moneys, materials, and other property used
    or  intended  for  use  as  payment  to  participate  in
    gambling or a prize or receipt for gambling; and

         (c)  Books,  records,  and  research  products  and
    materials,  including  formulas,  microfilm,  tapes, and
    data used or intended for use in gambling.

    A "gambling device" is defined  as "a contrivance which for a
consideration  affords  the  player   an  opportunity  to  obtain
something of value, other than free plays, automatically from the
machine  or  otherwise,   the   award   of  which  is  determined
principally  by  chance."    Minnesota  Statute  Section  609.75,
Subdivision 4 (1994).

    Under this definition of  "gambling  device", a computer that
is used to play a game of  chance for something of value would be
subject to forfeiture.

    Gambling is  just  one  example  of  illegal  activity on the
Internet.  However, the same jurisdictional principles apply with
equal force to any illegal activity.

         O'REILLY PUBLISHES GUIDE TO INTERNET FIREWALLS
           New Book Describes Theory and Practice of
                Key Computer Security Technology

SEBASTOPOL, CA--O'Reilly & Associates has released "Building Internet
Firewalls," a practical guide to protecting computer systems from the
growing threats to Internet security.

Determined Internet hackers and computer criminals can wreak havoc if
they break into computer systems that are connected to the Internet.
Firewalls are an important security tool for responding to this
threat--they keep damage on one part of the network (e.g.,
eavesdropping, a worm program, file damage) from spreading to the rest
of the network.  A hardware and/or software solution that restricts
access from an internal network to the Internet (and vice versa), a
firewall may also be used to separate two or more parts of a local
network (for example, protecting finance from R&D). Without firewalls,
network security problems can rage out of control.

"Building Internet Firewalls" describes a variety of firewall
approaches and architectures. It discusses Internet threats, the
benefits of firewalls, overall security strategies, and a summary of
Internet services and their security risks. In addition, the book
thoroughly covers the technical aspects of firewall design and
maintenance, including how to protect the bastion host in a firewall
configuration, how to build proxying and packet filtering firewalls,
and how to configure Internet services to operate with a firewall. Its
appendices include a resource summary, a directory of how to find
firewall toolkits and other security-related tools, and a detailed
summary providing TCP/IP background information.

More than a million computer systems are now connected to the
Internet.  Over 100 million email messages are exchanged each day,
along with countless files, documents, and images. For businesses that
are striving to be safe on the Net, "Building Internet Firewalls"
offers a comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of creating
effective firewalls.

About the Authors

D. Brent Chapman is a consultant in the San Francisco Bay Area,
specializing in Internet firewalls. He has designed and built Internet
firewall systems for a wide range of clients, using a variety of
techniques and technologies. He is also the manager of the Firewalls
Internet mailing list.

Elizabeth Zwicky is a senior system administrator at Silicon Graphics
and the president of SAGE (the System Administrators Guild). She has

Subject: File 3--CIX alternative to InterNIC's registration process.

CIX has put out a white paper on overhauling the domain registration &
routing system of the US portion of Internet.  Some of it sounds OK, most
of it does not sound any better than InterNIC's announcement that it'll
start charging for domain names.  Some of it's downright strange, and
inspires some concern in me.  Particular this section:

**********
   Domain registration will be open to anybody but subject to several
   restrictions to minimize abuse, i.e., acquisition of trademarked
   names. Domains registration will require submittal of a taxpayer
   identification number followed by hard copy submittal of company
   letterhead and notary certification. Trademark disputes will not be
   settled by the CIX but between parties in the appropriate legal forum.
   Domain registration will require a one time fee and a yearly
   maintenance fee.
**********

That's right.  No domains for any entity that is not a corporation with a
letterhead, no domain if you aren't willing to send a bunch of notarized
snail mail, no domain if you are not willing to have your Social Security
Number tied to your domain registration, no domain if you're not a US
citizen with a Soc. Security Number in the first place.  All this of course
directly contradicts the opening statement that domain registration is
available to "anybody".

The document says the registration process is "in realtime", whatever
that means.  The implication is that it'll be immediate, and faster than
InterNIC.  Somehow I have a hard time reconciling this with the
requirement for snailmailed paperwork.

Fortunately, this remains just a proposal.

Update --- Cult Internet Censorship in Norway
=============================================


News Release - 24th September 1995

On Thursday, 21st of September, news broke of another cult attempting
to silence its critics with the closing down of a student's account
at the Univeristy of Bergen, Norway. Within hours, this action had
been reported worldwide and many representations made by e-mail; the
staff responsible at the University have peddled various alternative
stories to those concerned net.citizens who wrote in protest. To set
the story straight and to record his gratitude for the enormous support
he has received, the student at the center of the affair, Mr Jan
Steinar Haugland, has released the following statement:

<beginning of statement>

In the autumn of 1993, when I was a Jehovah's Witness [JW], I met a
fellow Witness at a pub. His name was Kenneth Hostland, and I was
delighted to discover that he was a real Internet expert. I told him
about several JW resources that I had found on the Internet, such as
the "Friends" mailing list.

I had an email account at NHH, the Business School in Bergen, but at
the time the computing department there had closed all Internet access
except email and gopher, believing this would help them avoid viruses.
Kenneth said that since I was a student, I could get a less restricted
account at the University of Bergen (UiB).

The University and the NHH Business School are closely related. NHH
uses the University's computing facilities. If you are matriculated at
NHH, you can study at the University. Because of this close
connection, I decided to accept Kenneth Hostland's kind offer.  I
dropped by his office, where he filled out a paper form. I signed it
and I was apparently officially authorized to have an account.

In the spring of 1995, after wrestling with many disturbing questions
about JW doctrine, I came to the conclusion I could no longer be a
Jehovah's Witness. I was finally disfellowshiped (excommunicated) for
not believing the 90-year-old JW teaching about the significance of
the year 1914. Ironically, the very teaching I disagreed with was
recently rejected by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses. The
doctrinal reversal was announced to the Witnesses this month
(September 1995) in their official publication, the WatchTower.

When you are disfellowshipped, all Jehovah's Witnesses are instructed
to shun you.  Their leaders say that you deserve nothing less than
"complete hatred." (Watchtower, 1 Oct 1993, page 18)

My interest in the Witnesses continued, however.  From time to time, I
posted material on the Internet that was critical of JW doctrine. I
also posted quotes from old Watchtower publications which demonstrated
a history of failed predictions and doctrinal "adjustments".  These
were no doubt embarassing to the Witnesses, who believe that the
Watchtower organization is God's sole channel of information to the
world.

Kenneth Hostland, who was still a loyal Witness, decided to terminate
the account he had set up for me.  Even though I was now a student at
the University, and had submitted the proper University paperwork to
secure my access, Hans Morten Kind <kind@edb.uib.no> was instructed to
cancel my account.

When Kenneth Hostland first set up my account, I had no idea that
getting an account through the University was more difficult than the
studies themselves! The procedure was simpler at the NHH Business
School; students automatically got an account.  They didn't even have
to ask.

After my account was removed (September 21st, 1995), a number of
concerned individuals spread the news on Usenet groups and other
forums. Those who sent inquiries to the computing department were told
that my objections were "pure nonsense".  Mr. Kind and Mr. Hostland
later claimed that this was simply a technical matter, involving the
cleaning up of accounts.  Later still, they appealed to rules and
regulations at the University, saying that the account had been set up
improperly.

Their inconsistent and evasive replies to questions about this matter
lead me to only one conclusion:  if I had stayed a Jehovah's Witness,
my account would not have been cancelled.  I am certain it was removed
because I was critical towards the Watchtower Society, the multi-
billion dollar corporation that uses Jehovah's Witnesses to spread
their gospel.

Most censorship is done without actually breaking any laws. For
example, a newspaper has no legal duty to let all sides of a case be
heard. Yet, if they do not, they practice censorship. This practice
can be dangerous to democracy and freedom of speech, even when it is
technically legal.

The individuals responsible can provide credible excuses for their
actions; they have done nothing illegal. But it is still censorship.
Fortunately, even in cases of "legal" censorship, we all have the
right to protest.  Thanks to the global stage of the Internet, I am
able to tell the world:  I was taken off the Internet because of my
beliefs.

I believe that what they did is offensive to the Internet community,
where free speech is accorded the highest value. We all know that the
next time, censorship may hit someone who can not obtain another
account.

When you join in the protest directed at these individuals, you
demonstrate that the Internet community cares about censorship. Things
like this may happen again, but perhaps next time, the malicious
system administrator will remember how people rose up in protest, and
decide it isn't worth the trouble.

Mr. Kind is publicly calling me a liar, though it appears that he has
not read a single public statement I have made. He does not cite any
specifics; he simply says I am lying.

Before the protest gathered steam, Mr. Kind supported Mr. Hostland.
Now, however, his replies to protesters (apparently auto-mailed) claim
that my account was illegal from the start. This change of position
indicates that the protest is producing results.  But I still do not
have my original account. For justice to be done, I need your support.

My sincerest thanks you to all.

<end of statement>

However, the efforts of this cult to silence all dissidence continues
apace. Cult members themselves have been warned in an internal bulletin
this September of the dangers of on-line participation; immediately
following this many loyal cultists dropped out of religion forums on
the major on-line services, web sites were taken off or emptied of
content, and of the two main cult internet mailing lists, one
("friends-chat") was closed down, and the other ("friends-all") began
strict moderation of mail. A classic cult pattern of information control.

Cultists are not, alas, satisfied with self-censorship and a new campaign
has begun to harass postmasters - including the Finnish anon-server
administrator who has been a previous target - and SysOps of on-line
services with the aim of closing down internet accounts of those who dare
to utter a dissident voice in defiance of the supposed God-given authority
of their ruling council in Brooklyn, NY. The postmaster of one of Norway's
independent Internet providers, telepost.no, has resisted the mail-bombing
by cult members in defense of his customers right to free speech - however
there are reports this weekend that ex-cult members on other Internet
service providers may also have had their accounts closed or suspended.

These are independent individuals of limited means and influence, faced
with a multi-billion dollar multinational corporation and millions of
loyal followers taught to shun and hate anyone who dares impede their
business or uncover what they prefer to keep covered-up. Your support is
needed *now* to help protect internet freedoms of speech for *everyone* -
there are many other powerful corporations and governments, ready to
follow up such a trend of repression if the cults are able to do so with
impudence. If the first window is left broken, all the rest will follow.

                        "Computers & The Law"
                         November 12-15, 1995
                              Tampa, FL

As computers are utilized in more and more aspects of everyday life,
the once distinct areas of technology, legislature, and law
enforcement draw closer together.  This unique technical conference
provides a forum in which members of these three fields can meet to
share experiences and ideas.  The four day technical program (a day of
tutorials, two days of talks, and another day of tutorials) will
provide you with essential knowledge, whether your field is technical,
legal, or law enforcement.

More detailed information of this symposium are available via email at
conference@sug.org or on the World Wide Web at http://sug.org.

The SUG Tutorial Program brings experienced training professionals to

experts in their topic areas.  The tutorials will cover a variety of
topics relating to Sun/SPARC and x86-based machines, running any of a
number of operating systems.

Those who attend the tutorials will benefit from this unique
opportunity to develop essential skills in a unique combination of
UNIX system security, ethical, and legal topics.

The tutorial program at Tampa is divided into two days, with both
full- and half-day tutorials offered.  Attendees may select any
non-overlapping set of classes.  To ensure adequate seating and to
reduce crowding, we are requiring that registrants pre-register for
specific classes.  Please note that some prior knowledge is required
for the advanced tutorials.

SUG's tutorial program is always in demand, and some tutorials are
almost guaranteed to sell out before registration closes.  Attendance
