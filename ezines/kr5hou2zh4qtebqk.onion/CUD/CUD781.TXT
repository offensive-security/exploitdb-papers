ACM DL'96 --- Digital
Libraries '96

First ACM International Conference on
Digital Libraries

Bethesda, MD
March 20-23, 1996

ACM Digital Libraries '96 is an international conference
devoted to advancing the state-of-the-art in digital
libraries.  The ACM DL series continues the sequence of
Texas conferences: DL'94 in College Station and DL'95 in
Austin.  The leaders of those events are helping with DL'96
organization and program efforts.  The meeting will be co-
located with Hypertext '96 in 1996 and with ACM SIGIR
'97 the following year.  DL '96 will immediately follow
Hypertext '96 at the Hyatt Regency
in Bethesda, Maryland.  The site is located near the
Washington D.C. Metro and provides easy access to the
many attractions in the Baltimore-Washington area.

The DL series is sponsored by ACM, through SIGIR and
SIGLINK.   Other ACM SIGs have joined in cooperation,
including: SIGAda, SIGART, SIGBIO, SIGCAPH,
SIGCOMM, SIGCUE, SIGDA,  SIGMIS (formerly SIGBIT),
and SIGOIS.

In-cooperation sponsors include:

ASIS (American Society for Information Science),
CNI (Coalition for Networked Information),
IEEE CS (IEEE Computer Society)
KSI (Knowledge Systems Inc.),
LITA (Library and Information Technology Association),
LoC (Library of Congress),
NAL (National Agricultural Library),
NLM (National Library of Medicine),
SLA (Special Libraries Association).

Three sessions at the conference have been reserved for the
working groups of the Digital Library Forum.  These
groups are studying aspects of interoperability in digital
libraries.  During the sessions, members of the groups will
describe the objectives of the groups, describe progress to
date, and lead discussions of the issues.  The exact list of
topics has not been finally chosen, but will likely include
open architectures for digital libraries, archiving and
digital preservation, and the National Computer Science
Technical Reports Library.



Technical Program

We seek papers, posters and videos on the one hand--and
proposals for tutorials and workshops on the other hand--
on topics related to Digital Libraries, including but not
limited to the following list:

* architectures, reference models, standards
* authoring and electronic publishing
* cataloging, indexing, preserving
* collaborative environments
* collecting, capturing, filtering
* distributed data, knowledge and information
representation and systems

* networking systems, protocols, security
* publisher plans and concerns
* user interfaces
* visualization, browsing, searching

Papers

Technical papers present original reports of innovative and
substantive new work that has not been published or
submitted for publication elsewhere.  Papers are refereed by
a pool of reviewers for the conference proceedings,
published by ACM.  Because of the tight time schedule,
designed to ensure that the latest results will be discussed,
there will be little time for revision, so submissions should
be in near-final form.

Important Dates:
Oct. 17, 1995 --- Papers due to Program Chair
Dec. 1, 1995 --- Authors notified about PC decisions
Jan. 1, 1996 --- Papers due to Program Chair

  O'REILLY RELEASES 2ND EDITION OF "ESSENTAIL SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION"
            Updated Classic Covers All Major UNIX Platforms

SEBASTOPOL, CA--O'Reilly & Associates has released the second edition
of "Essential System Administration," its bestselling guide for UNIX
system administrators. This new edition has been updated for the latest
versions of all major UNIX platforms (including Sun OS 4.1, Solaris
2.3, AIX 4.1, Linux 1.1, Digital UNIX OSF/1, SCO UNIX version 3, HP/UX
versions 9 and 10, and IRIX version 6), and the entire book has been
thoroughly reviewed and tested on all of the platforms covered. In
addition, coverage of networking, electronic mail, security, and kernel
configuration has been expanded substantially.

Originally published in 1991, "Essential System Administration" was the
first book to take an in-depth look at the fundamentals of UNIX system
administration in a real-world, heterogeneous environment. The book
approaches UNIX systems administration from the perspective of the
system administrator's job -- the routine tasks and troubleshooting
that make up the sysadmin's day. When faced with the challenges of
dealing with frustrated users, convincing an uncomprehending manager
that new hardware is needed, rebuilding the kernel, or simply adding
new users, system administrators will find help in this book. It covers
back up and restore, organizing and planning file systems, TCP/IP
networking, and setting up email. In addition, it explains core system
administration tasks such as setting up printers, adding terminals and
disk drives, and securing the system. But "Essential System
Administration" is not for full-time systems administrators alone.
Linux users and others who administer their own systems will benefit
from its practical, hands-on approach.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

AEleen Frisch has been a system administrator for 15 years. Currently,
she spends some of her time looking after a very heterogeneous network
of UNIX workstations and PCs.  She also writes the "Systems Wrangler"
column for RS/Magazine, which focuses on system administration on AIX
systems.  AEleen has a B.S. in literature from Caltech and a Ph.D. in
cultural studies from Pitt.

"As the world grows smaller and our hierarchical systems prove
increasingly inadequate, we must create new, cooperative, and more
nurturing systems of human organization in cyberspace. It's our only
chance to overcome the threat of environmental and social demise."
                                         ... Marilyn Davis

Ms. Davis views our current democracies as futile attempts to
facilitate equally shared decision-making on a large scale.  She
believes that all humans share a longing for a fair system and that
cyberspace is unfolding as a manifestation of that longing.

In cyberspace, we *can* facilitate equally distributed, broad-based
decision-making ---  Should we?

As the developer of eVote, vote-serving software for online groups,
Marilyn will demonstrate a prototype of the theoretically *perfect*
community server: a web-accessible, graphical meeting package with
branching discussion trees, outline support, and user-generated
polling.

She will describe the relatively small development task this community
software requires: a synthesis of three existing software applications
-- A WWW browser/server; Participate, meeting software; and eVote.

                         * * *

The Palo Alto Community Network, or PA-COMNET, is a group of Palo Alto
area residents who share a common interest in using Internet-based
online communications to build a better community.

PA-COMNET meets continuously by means of an email list.  To join, send
an email message to majordomo@svi.org with no subject line but a

Date--Mon, 2 Oct 95 23:16:42 -0400
From--Michael Hawley <mike@pia.media.mit.edu


As part of the Media Lab's 10th Anniversary, we are assembling
snapshots of Cyberspace. We would like *you* to be part of the
first global portrait of human life in the digital age.  This site
will collect bits from October 1 through October 10. Results will
be published on the Web, in a subsequent book, and will become part
of a permanent archive.

Stop and think: five years ago, the internet for most people felt
like tin cans and string.  Two years ago the Web and Mosaic were
just beginning to be noticed.  Now, every day, something utterly
mindblowing turns up with a point and a click.  This is a pivotal
era, and a perfect time to ask the digital world to pause, and
ponder the implications of digital media on future world culture.

WANTED: DIGITAL PIONEERS ===========================================

We are searching for compelling stories about digital life.

For example, we received an amazing message about how the Net is
being used to protect endangered mountain gorillas. As part of
NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, the space shuttle Endeavour made
radar scans of the gorillas' habitat near the Virunga volcano, in
central Africa. With handheld GPS satellite instruments, which
anti-poaching rangers have been trained to use in the field, daily
readings of gorilla movements and poacher activities are sent from
a portable ground station in the mountains to another satellite,
HealthSat II, and then over the Internet to the 3-D tracking system
based at Rutgers University.  There are only 650 mountain gorillas
left in the world, and this system is helping to save them.

What we need are *your* bits -- your stories, in text, sound, and
picture. How are global digital media affecting your life? Changing
the fabric of world society? Touching human interests? What might
the picture look like in 5 years? 50 years? Let us know, and quickly.

COUNT TO TEN =======================================================

During the days from 10/1 to 10/9 we focus on several themes:

 1 Privacy -- Anonymity, Security, Privacy & Trust in a Digital Society
 2 Expression -- Digital Art, Entertainment & Community Creativity
 3 Generations -- Kids & Childhood, Seniors, Life Stories and Family
 4 Wealth -- Advertising, Barter, Commerce and Personalized Trade
 5 Faith -- Religion and Politics and their Net Effects
 6 Body -- Sex, Health, Your Body and Technology
 7 Place -- Our Sense of Place in a Post-Digital World
 8 Tongues -- Languages in the Global Village
 9 Environment -- Coexistence and Coevolution of Natural and Virtual Worlds

For example, in "Generations" we'd like to hear from the youngest
kids on line, and connect them with the oldest senior citizens.
During the day on "Place" we'd like to collect images from every
netcam on earth, and bits from every country on earth with some
tie to the Net. Do you communicate with a friend in Antarctica or
Bosnia by e-mail? Did you find life-saving medecine in time, thanks
to the Net? Was your wedding online? Your newborn child?

10/10: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CYBERSPACE =============================

Then, on 10/10, live from the Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
teams of professional editors and World Wide Web hackers working
in "mission control" at MIT will collect, edit, and publish the
best of those bits on the net. Taken together, these bits will
create a mosaic of life at the dawn of the digital revolution that
is transforming our planet.

HOW TO DO IT =======================================================

1. Through the World Wide Web: http://www.1010.org
2. By e-mail, send specific remarks to:
      cyber@1010.org --- general reflections on digital life
      privacy@... --- comments regarding privacy, anonymity
      expression@... --- art, entertainment & community creativity
      generations@... --- kids, seniors, life stories, family
      wealth@... --- advertising, barter, commerce, personalized trade
      faith@... --- religion and politics
      body@... --- sex, health, our bodies & technology
      place@... --- geography, telecommuting, mobility, virtual v. physical
      tongues@ --- languages and communications on line
      environment@... --- mixing of natural and digital worlds
3. By ftp (to send sounds, pictures):
      ftp to ftp.1010.org, login anonymous
      cd pub/incoming
      "put" your bits.
      Please pick a unique filename, and also give us
      a file called "<mybits.README" to explain who you
      are and what your data is.
4. For more information, mail to: info@1010.org

ABOUT YOUR BITS ====================================================

You are writing a community book.

Your input is being used to illuminate the stories of digital life.
Your bits will become part of a global, public, community event --
a canvas that we all paint together. The visualizations and time
capsules, as well as selected responses will be archived and may
be published by the MIT Media Lab or its agents in the future. Some

Subject: File 6--New Web site on government censorship

The Web sites I've seen on Exon etc. seem to be getting out of date,
or just focus on one or two details.  So, with help from Cyber-Rights
members (a CPSR working group) and some other people, I wrote a new
Web page to present the main issues in a punchy, direct way.  The
title is "Government Censorship Threatens the Information
Infrastructure."  It refers to other Web pages for details.

Please let everyone who might be interested know about this URL.

Thanks to everybody who contributed information and ideas,
particularly Craig Johnson.
