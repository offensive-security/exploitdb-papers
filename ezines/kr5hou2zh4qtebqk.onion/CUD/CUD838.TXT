                             Washington, D.C.
  ================================================================

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has finally released its
long-overdue report on implementation on the controversial "digital
telephony" wiretap statute.  The report, which the FBI was legally
required to release by November 30, 1995, was transmitted to Congress
on April 11, 1996.  EPIC had made several congressional inquiries
concerning the FBI's failure to comply with the statutory reporting
requirement.

The bottom line: the digital telephony program is broke, which may
explain the Bureau's tardiness in issuing the report.  When Congress
enacted the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)
in late 1994, it authorized $500 million to reimburse
telecommunications carriers for the cost of retro-fitting their
networks to facilitate electronic surveillance.  Since that time, EPIC
has led an effort to block the actual appropriation of those funds.
To date, Congress has declined to make the money available.  As the FBI
report notes,

     No funding was appropriated in Fiscal Year 1995 for
     CALEA; therefore, no payments were made to telecommuni-
     cations carriers during the period October 1, 1994,
     through September 30, 1995 ...

     To date, no funding has been appropriated for Fiscal
     Year 1996 for payments to telecommunications carriers. ...

     Major switch manufacturers, upon whom telecommunications
     carriers must rely for most required technological
     solutions, have advised the FBI that timely development
     of interception features is technically feasible; however,
     the development and deployment of such features are
     directly dependent upon the availability of funding if
     the statutory deadlines are to be met.

The wiretap budget battle will continue.  The FBI is still trying to
gain approval of $100 million for FY 1996, "to be generated through a
surcharge on civil fines and penalties."  The report also notes that
"the President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request proposes $100 million
in funding for telephone carrier compliance through a direct
appropriation."

Subject--CyberAngels Mission Statement and C.o.C

CYBERANGELS MISSION STATEMENT
v.2.0, May 1, 1996
written by Colin Gabriel Hatcher, CyberAngels Director

CyberAngels an all-volunteer Internet safety patrol and monitoring project
started in June of 1995 by senior members of the world famous crime
prevention organization, The International Alliance of Guardian Angels.

CyberAngels membership unites more than 1000 users worldwide in 30
countries, sharing a common mission: to be a Cyberspace Neighborhood Watch
and to fight Internet crime.

By being role models for self-regulation and responsibility, we are working
hard to make the Internet a safer and more enjoyable place to work and
play.

We are dedicated to:

FIGHTING CRIME ON THE INTERNET
in particular criminal activity where there are clear victims and/or
at-risk users.

PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN FROM ONLINE CRIMINAL ABUSE
by fighting against the trade in child pornography and by working to deter
sexual predators online.


SUPPORTING AND ADVISING ONLINE VICTIMS
of hate mail, harassment, and sexual abuse by referring them to
professional assistance, and helping guide them through the complaints and
reporting processes.


PROMOTING, PRESERVING, PROTECTING NETIQUETTE
Netiquette is the collection of common rules of polite conduct that govern
our use of the Internet. We believe in courtesy and respect for others. We
support Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who have clearly defined Terms Of
Service (TOS) for their users, and who are prepared and willing to enforce
that TOS.

HELPING PRESERVE INTERNET FREEDOM OF SPEECH
by showing global governments that the citizens of the Internet Community
are prepared and willing to take both the responsibility and the actions
necessary to preserve their online personal safety, and in particular, the
online safety of their children.


CYBERANGELS CODES OF CONDUCT
v.1.0, May 18, 1996
written by Colin Gabriel Hatcher, CyberAngels Director

1) CyberAngels should not flame, neither in email nor in newsgroups.

2) At all times CyberAngels understand that they speak and act only for
themselves and are fully responsible for their words and actions.

3) The CyberAngels Organization will acknowledge and defend you only if you
act in accordance with our Mission Statement and with our Codes of Conduct.

4) CyberAngels should not use anonymous or pseudo-anonymous remailers to
communicate with ISPs, Federal authorities or Law Enforcement, as the use
of anonymity in these cases will undermine the credibility of your
complaint or report.

5) CyberAngels should be courteous and respectful in their communications
with others.

6) CyberAngels should phrase all complaints and reports as questions.
Remember you are neither judge, jury nor executioner - you are a witness to
a suspect and a possible crime.

7) CyberAngels should be capable of telling the difference between material
or activity that may be crime evidence and material or activity that
personally offends their morals or beliefs.

8) CyberAngels should always observe the Netiquette of whatever group or
channel they are in.

9) CyberAngels should not spam replies, opinions or information.

10) CyberAngels should never use any form of electronic harassment, e.g.,
mail-bombs, virii, spoofing mail headers, spamming etc.

11) CyberAngels should avoid humiliating suspects either in public or in
private.  Gloating over their impending arrest or taunting them with the
Feds is unacceptable conduct.

12) All suspects are innocent until proven guilty.

13) All complaints and reports sent in to authorities by CyberAngels should
maintain privacy and confidentiality.  Reports are the business of the
CyberAngel, the receiving authority and the CyberAngels Organization.

14) Remember:
a) Headers can be spoofed (forged) on email and on Usenet postings.
b) In live channels the user you are dealing with may not be the account
holder of the access account.
c) Impersonation is common in IRC / Live Chat
d) Without crime evidence, it is just your opinion.
e) Just because you don't like something, that doesn't make it criminal.

15) Sting operations (e.g. when you work undercover, masquerading as a
pedophile in order to gather crime evidence) may obtain you crime evidence,
but that evidence may later be ruled inadmissible in court, on the grounds
that it was obtained by unlawful means.  Study your country's / state's
laws carefully on this matter, or contact your local law enforcement to
discuss this.

16) No CyberAngel should offer child pornography images to trade, even if
the purpose is to gather more crime evidence.

17) Received graphic files should be viewed before forwarding them to
appropriate Internet Administration (e.g. the sender's Internet Service
Provider) or Law Enforcement (e.g. US Customs or FBI).  CyberAngels
checking graphic files should follow the procedure below:
a) Download and decode file to a floppy disk.
b) View file and confirm your suspicions.
c) Forward original file to relevant authorities.
d) Reformat your floppy disk to permanently erase all trace of the
downloaded file.

If you are downloading to a Hard Drive, then after deleting the file you
should erase your Hard Drive's free space, or reformat free space, so as to
make the file unrecoverable.

18) CyberAngels should avoid storing archives of child pornography in any
format whatsoever.  If you store this material you run the risk of being
accused of collecting it for your own personal use.

19) A CyberAngel may identify themselves publicly only if they support our
Mission Statement and follow our Codes of Conduct.

20) In live channels like IRC or in the Live Chat areas of the big in-house
providers like AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy, CyberAngels have the following
2 options when entering a channel:
a) Identify yourself as a CyberAngel on patrol immediately.
b) Say nothing about your being a CyberAngel.

a) Identify yourself as a CyberAngel on patrol immediately.
Advantage: everyone on the channel knows you are available to assist if
there is a problem.  Also you will act as an effective visual deterrent if
a crime is about to take place.
Disadvantage: In IRC if the Channel Op is hostile, then you will be
immediately kicked off the channel.  Also criminal activity will move
somewhere else away from your eyes, so you will be unable to witness
criminal activity.  Also, once your userid becomes known, you will be
unable to operate anonymously in the future.
b) Say nothing about your being a CyberAngel.
Advantage: Criminal activity is more likely to take place if no one knows
what you are doing, therefore your ability to gather crime evidence will be
enhanced.
Disadvantage: Since no one knows who you are, no one can identify you
immediately as someone offering assistance.  Also CyberAngels gets no
visibility if all its patrolling members are anonymous.

21) If suspected criminal activity, like child pornography trading, is
observed in a live channel, CyberAngels have 4 options:
a) Immediately identify yourself as a CyberAngel and ask the person to desist.
b) Immediately notify an online channel guardian / sysop / host / guide to
come and deal with the problem
c) Remain silent and gather information / evidence, without requesting it,
to report later to relevant authority.
d) Participate in the activity, and masquerade as a pedophile, so as to
infiltrate the operation.

a) Immediately identify yourself as a CyberAngel and ask the person
politely to desist.
Advantage: You will rid the channel immediately of the problem.  Also you
will let others in the channel know you are there to help if needed.
Disadvantage:  Criminal activity will move and continue in a secret or
private channel.  In IRC you may even be kicked off the channel.
b) Immediately notify an online channel guardian / sysop / host / guide to
come and deal with the problem
Advantage:  Summoning the online administrators of a live area is always a
good idea if you have a problem.
Disadvantage: none.
c) Remain silent and gather information / evidence, without requesting it,
to report later to relevant authority.
Advantage: You may get placed on a trading list of users on the channel as
pictures are often spammed out, even if you don't personally request any,
thus you will obtain crime evidence as other users trade in return and
reply to all.  This method of obtaining material is less likely to be ruled
inadmissible later in court, as it was not unlawfully requested.  You also
avoid flames and hate mail and other harassment that may follow a public
bust.
Disadvantage: You may be mistaken for a pedophile yourself.
d) Participate in the activity, and masquerade as a pedophile, so as to
infiltrate the operation.
Advantage: You can gain a lot of crime evidence and understanding of the
operation if you infiltrate it.
Disadvantage: You may be mistaken for a pedophile yourself.  Also your
evidence may be ruled inadmissible later in court.

22) All CyberAngels should keep logs of their activities, detailing logon
and logoff times, channels / URLs / sites visited, with time of arrival and
departure from sites, logs of suspicious conversations, postings and
records of what, if any, actions were taken.  CyberAngels may store headers
from postings as reference, but should avoid storing graphic files that may
be criminal to possess.

23) Copies of correspondence with all Authorities, relevant Usenet postings
or email, should all be cc'd to angels@wavenet.com.

24) How does a CyberAngel decide what material or activity to complain about?

When on patrol you should consider the following responses to material or
activity that you witness:
a) Harm
b) Fear
c) Distress
d) Inconvenience
e) Offense
f) Concern

These categories give you a ladder of responses to what you are finding.
You may choose to complain about / report *anything* that causes you or
others Harm, Fear, Distress, Inconvenience, Offense or Concern, regardless
of whether it is criminal or not.  The right to question what you see and
to bring it to the attention of the proper authorities is your civil, legal
and human right.  In the USA this is Constitutionally protected.

These are subjective judgments, based on the way you personally feel about
what you see, or what happens to you.  The fact that they are subjective in
no way invalidates them.  You have a right to your response.

a) Harm - Harm is something that hurts you or another.  On the Net it is
not possible to physically harm someone, but you may still be a witness to
harm.  In the case of child pornography you are witnessing a record of harm
done to a child when the picture was taken.  A child has been sexually
abused for the gratification of adults.  So if you witness child
pornography you are witness to a record of actual bodily harm - sexual
abuse or child abuse.

b) Fear - Fear means that you are witness to something that frightens you,
that is puts you in fear for your physical or mental well-being.  You may
receive a death threat by email from someone who has located your home
address; you may become aware of a child arranging a liaison with an adult
online, and giving that adult personal information like the child's
telephone number.  You may fear that something will happen in the future.

c) Distress - Hate mail causes distress.  Distress means anything that
makes you feel upset, e.g., makes you cry or feel like crying.  A 13 year
old Korean girl not long ago committed suicide as a result of hatred and
abuse directed at her in IRC.  Clearly she was distressed by what had
happened to her online.

d) Inconvenience - Inconvenience means your life is disrupted by some
outside cause.  All forms of electronic harassment cause inconvenience:
having your account terminated for no reason, receiving a mail bomb or a
virus, or having your mailbox filling up with spam.  The emotion that goes
with inconvenience is usually anger.

e) Offense - There are plenty of things that you might come across on the
Net that you may find offensive.  With offense comes anger and outrage.
Many people find all forms of pornography offensive, or some of the more
bad taste newsgroups, or even someone's foul language. Christians find
Satanists offensive, and vice versa.  Offensive activity is more of a
personal issue for you and your conscience, since it is very hard to
objectively define "offensive".

f) Concern - Concern is not usually the product of anger or distress.
Concern means that you are worried about something, e.g. the easy access
children have to pornography on the Net.  If something concerns you, you
should feel that you have a right to express your concern.

The right and the choice to complain is yours.  CyberAngels should aim to
complain to the appropriate place.  It is inappropriate for example to
complain to the FBI because you are offended by someone cursing online.
But you have every right to complain a) to the abuser and b) to the
abuser's service provider.  You might even choose to write a letter to your
Senator or Congressperson, expressing your feelings about rudeness and foul
language on the Net.  The point is that you seek appropriate ways to
express your feelings.

25) Whether any of the above categories are criminal in nature can not be
decided by a CyberAngel, nor even by the Police.  The determination of
guilt or innocence can only be made by a court of law.  This should be
borne in mind when you are considering what to do and who to contact.  Even
if you have a good working knowledge of the relevant laws, and CyberAngels
should educate themselves in this area, you are still not qualified to
decide guilt or innocence.

26) If you decide to take a matter further, a CyberAngel should phrase a
letter of complaint in the first person.  It is far better to say "I
believe this to be criminal" than to say "This is criminal".  "I am
offended" is better than "This is offensive".  Own your own words.

27) The main focus of CyberAngel activity is on material and activities
that are harmful, distressing and inconvenient.  These are activities where
there are real-life victims, i.e. people.

28) On the Internet people are free to do what they want.  They are also
free to take the consequences of their actions.  Each user, whether they
like it or not, is bound by the laws of the country they are logging in
from.  This fact applies to CyberAngels equally.  CyberAngels have no
special powers or privileges on the Internet.

29) All CyberAngels should recognize that we are a worldwide umbrella
organization of people from many different cultures.  We believe in and
practise tolerance, and as long as our Mission Statement and Codes of
Conduct are followed, we have no problem working together with people who
in other respects have very different views from our own.

29) All CyberAngels should strive to be role-models for self-regulation and
responsibility.  In this way we seek to protect and preserve the very
wonderful world that we inhabit, that we call Cyberspace or the Internet.

----------------------------------------------------------------
                      *Georgia Law Could Prohibit Web Links*

Legislation recently signed into law by Georgia Governor Zell
Miller is aimed at preventing fraud in cyberspace, but the
Chronicle of Higher Education recently reported that critics say
it could force developers of World Wide Web pages to remove links
to other pages.

The law, the Chronicle reported, makes it a crime to "falsely
identify" oneself on the Net, or to direct people to someone else's
computer without the other person's explicit permission.

The ACLU said the Georgia law raises serious questions.

"The Georgia law -- like the federal Communications Decency Act -
- is just another example of legislators rushing to criminallize
communication in the online medium before they even begin to
understand how it operates," said Ann Beeson, an ACLU expert on
cyberspace.

"In the process," Beeson continued, "they have violated the free
speech rights of cybercitizens and have drastically hindered a
democratizing medium that enables people to communicate and share
information around the world in a way never previously possible."

Subject: File 4--Rough Draft: Guide for Organizing Online

NOTE: This is a VERY incomplete initial draft on which a longer guide for
creating local online organizations will be based.  It's also very U.S.
oriented in this version.  If you have comments or suggestions, send to
jonl@hotwired.com or jonl@well.com...

Why organize locally/regionally? Why not join a national organization?

Do join one or more national or international organizations, but organize
locally, as well. Only local groups can monitor local politics "Freedom
and Privacy" are local as well as national issues.  Freedom can be
threatened as readily on a muncipal as a state or national level, so it's
as important to have a network of empowered activists organizing cities as
it is to have activists working `inside the Beltway.'

In fact, though some disaffected citizens imagine that a monolithic
Federal government churns on ignoring the wishes of John Q. America,
government tends to be a bottom-up proposition in the U.S.  Most
legislators really do listen to their constituents, and are sensitive to
their input when they hear it.  If we want `em to hear, we have to turn
the volume up...the way you do that is to get numbers with faces, and get
`em organized locally, so that the pols will see and hear them during
home-turf visits.  Beyond that, it wouldn't hurt (as Jerry Berman once
advised me) to load a busfull of local activists and drive them to
Washington to drop in on the legislative offices for the area's
representatives.

Distribution: Local groups create and (most important) maintain membership
lists that are potential distribution nodes for evolving grassroots
networks.  This allows for hierarchical, moderated distribution of
essential information from national sources, and for organization on a
local level in the `think globally, act locally' mode.

Board of Directors: Find 4-5 individuals who will commit to the
organization and work to meet its goals. Find persons with skills you can
use: attorney, system administrator, writer/editor, accountant. Establish
a Board of Directors and Incorporate Take special care in creating your
mission statement.  Look at mission statements for groups like EFF and
EFF-Austin Also look at bylaws and articles of incorporation for existing
groups Articles of incorporation will include your mission.  Here's
EFF-Austin's:

(a) to engage in and support educational activities that
increase understanding of the opportunities and challenges posed by
computing and telecommunications, and related civil liberties issues.

(b) to foster a clearer social understanding of the issues
underlying free and open telecommunications; and

(c) to facilitate and encourage communication between
individuals interested in computer and telecommunication
technology and related social and legal issues.

* Consider whether you want to apply for 501(c)3 classification so that
  donations to the group are tax deductible.  This decision has pros
  (facilitates fund raising) and cons (501(c)3 corporations can't overtly
  lobby). EFF-Austin to date has not completed the paperwork for 501(c)3.

* Find volunteers for core tasks within the BOD and membership base

* In addition to officers, you need someone to handle public relations,
  someone to take responsibility for the membership database, and someone to
  handle the online presence

* Establish an online presence

* Find an ISP or other system that will provide a comp account

* Set up an email list for members and interested persons

* Set up aliases for the board of directors, advisory board, perhaps others

* Create a web page

* Include a membership form on the web page

* Establish a membership base

* Recruit members online and in meatspace.

* Keep dues low

* Offer value to members

* Hold monthly BOD and membership meetings

* Get to know your local police: EFF-Austin has a police liaison (Bruce
  Sterling).  One of his jobs is to ensure that the police know who we are
  and will call us for consultation.

* Get to know the press

* Create focus events that are well-blurbed

* Find cooperating attorneys

* Talk to other like-minded groups

* Minimize costs

* Leverage computer-mediated communication

* Know your enemies

* Know your friends

* Know your rights

* Always challenge bad press

* Always encourage good press

* Take public positions

Subject: File 5--Triumph of the Nerds, 3-hour PBS Jun.12th special (R-rated? :-)

[Inflicted on you because you know me.  Redistrib as desired.]

Computer nerds and nerd-alikes might wish to mark June 12th on their calendars.

PBS will air "Triumph of the Nerds" nationally on Wednesday, June 12th --
as a 3-hour special that they will be promoting as *the* PBS event for
June.  The host is Infoworld's "Robt Cringely" (a pseudonym) and is based
mo'less on his book, _Accidental Empires_, that discloses how many personal
computing personalities stumbled into successes.

In the show, Cringely interviews a number of microcomputing's "pioneers" --
including Bill Gates ... and even li'l ol' me -- seeking candid insights
and tales about the early daze <sic> of personal computing.

The 3-hour premier show will include scenes that will *not* appear in later
re-airings by various PBS stations, in snipped-down one-hour segments, nor
will they be included in the "Nerds" videotapes that PBS will offer for
sale.

My understanding is that, among other things, the one-time-only showing
will include some comments about Gates' notorious mid-1970s letter to
editors accusing computer hobbyists of being thieves, pirating the
life-blood of his little software company (i.e., duplicating the
paper-tapes of Microsoft's first BASIC interpreter that -- if memory serves
-- they were trying to sell for $350, for the MITS Altair 808-based
computer kit that cost $395).  Donno what other morstels will be included.


NERDS IN THE NUDE

Although the show was taped last fall, it follows a "tradition" later
developed for pubic figures in the San Francisco Bay area:

*  In December, shortly before San Francisco's mayorial election, ex-police
chief and then-Mayor Frank Jordan held a somewhat unusual photo-op.  He was
featured on front pages and teevee doing a nude shower interview with two
local disk-jockeys. The shots were tastefully(?) clipped slightly above the
jockey-shorts that Jordon was obviously not wearing.

*  Earlier this month, Stanford computer instructor and local
microprocessor consultant/author/wizard John Wharton gained national fame
as "Shower Man" when Dave Letterman chose him out of his Late Show audience
to send to the showers -- broadcasting Wharton continent-wide,
well-lathered in Letterman's shower where the show was produced during a
week's visit in San Francisco.

So ...


When the "Nerds" producers first interviewed me last year, planning what
they were going shoot with which of whom, I suggested doing the interview
in my [large] hot tub -- on my redwooded San Francisco Peninsula ridgetop,
overlooking about 100 miles of the Pacific.

I mean, after *all* -- we Silicon Valley / Californica <sic> types *do*
have our reputations to maintain.

(Actually, I had more in mind doing the initial *off*-camera interview with
the producer and very attractive assistant producer, who had properly
oooh'ed and ahhh'ed over the ho'tub and vistas, as I was showing them
around my mountaintop -- but that detracts from the story. :-)


They discussed the idea and came back saying that Cringely would just
*love* to do the ON-camera interview in the buff ... uh, in the ho'tub.
(Woppps! -- my bluff was called.)

I first said that I'd do it if all the video crew -- including, of course,
the attractive assistant producer -- were also sans threads ... but it was
a cool morning with wisps of fog flitting about, and for some strange
reason they seemed disinclined, so I relented.


Reasoned I:  I *should* honor the origins of my [questionable claims] to
such fame and accidental fortune.  After all --

*  I never would have gotten into computing in 1968, had I not been looking
for work ... after resigning (upon request) from chairing the Math Dept at
the College of Notre Dame, a catholic girls' college where the nun who was
President somehow felt that the huge nude parties I was convening at my
mountain home, not far from the area's nude beach, were somehow
incompatible with the philosophy of a Catholic girls' school -- especially
after rumors about the events began to spread through the student body [so
to speak] ... in a college where many of the parents appeared to be doing
everying possible to delay daughters' becoming women long enough to marry
them off.

[Hey! -- remember ... those hippie '60s were different times, back when
Newt was smokin' dope and Willie wasn't inhaling.  And no, I did not make a
practice of inviting my students, and not even one of the Sisters ever
attended -- though some of the lay faculty joined in.]

*  And for the seven years that I ran the Computer Faires and
InfoWorld-to-be -- or they ran me -- clothing was always optional around
our mountaintop compound, and the pool and ho'tub were popular in slack
times, often sans slacks (ahhh, to return to the girth of those times :-).

[You shoulda seen the UPS delivery guy when he walked into the office one
day, only to find my completely-tanned, voluptuous young bookeeper and me
consulting in the all-together with my office manager -- whom he knew was
also my bookeeper's mother, and my next-door neighbor and good friend!  We
just turned casually, smiled brightly, and pointed to the outgoing
packages.]


[Back on topic]  So with their "Nerds" camera rolling, Cringely and I began
chatting about ISDN versus Frame Relay ... and stripped to zip.  Once in
the ho'tub, in place of coy camera angles, I turned on the bubbles for
strategic opacity ("Bubbles, Bob?", asked I :-).

You'll have to watch PBS on June 12th to, uh, see the rest.

Somehow, I suspect that Bellevue Bill's interview was probably conducted
with more mundane "style" ... but who knows.  Guess we'll just have to wait
for the movie.


And oh yes -- Cringely tells me:

>The shows have already run in England to great acclaim (our tub scene was
>especially popular).  The series has also been sold to networks in Ireland,
>Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Holland, Czech & Slovak Reps, Croatia, Hong Kong,
>Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, South Africa, British Airways (inflight), and
>a couple of others I can't remember.


I guess this will sorta blow my cover.  :-)  But then again, I'm not
planning to run for office ... and I *am* a WYSIWYG sorta guy.

Subject: File 6--Job Position for Manager of Network Services

Since I know that many readers of the CU digest are real
network/computer "gurus" I thought I would see if there are any
network experts there who beyond traditional system admin, has very
strong "theoretical" networking skills in the "emerging" technologies
such as ATM, FDDI, Cellular/Switched Packet Networks, Satellite,
Cable, etc, etc.

I work for Motorola University's Emerging Technologies Group and we
are looking to find a Manager of Network Services who has very strong
networking "design" skills to develop efficient network systems to
distribute multimedia and other forms of training.

If anyone is interested please email me at georgew@mot.com and I will
send you the job description requirements. I don't think it's
appropriate to add extra bandwidth to the digest for the description.

Thanks,
George
Staff Engineer

---------- Forwarded message ----------

    Dutch Internet Hotline Against Child Pornography


As of today it is possible to report child pornography postings
originating from the Netherlands to a special hotline,
meldpunt@xs4all.nl.

If you see any child pornography pictures on Internet, posted by a
dutch user, then the hotline is the right place to report a complaint.
We will warn the user about his posting, and ask him to cancel any
illegal materials that where posted by him. If the warning is ignored,
then the hotline will forward any available information to the
vice-squad of the local police, so they can prosecute the distributor
of child pornography pictures.

If you spot a child pornography picture in a Usenet posting,
then check the headers, especially the NNTP-Posting-Host:.
If that header contains a domain-name adress that terminates on
'.nl' then send us the headers of that message, so we can
investigate the report.


    *** Reports can be sent to meldpunt@xs4all.nl ***

More information about the hotline against child pornography on
Internet can be found at: http://www.xs4all.nl/~meldpunt

This hotline is a self-regulating Internet initiative by the foundation
for Dutch Internetproviders (NLIP), the Dutch National Criminal
Intelligence Service (CRI), Internet users, a psychologist and the National
Bureau against Racism (LBR).
