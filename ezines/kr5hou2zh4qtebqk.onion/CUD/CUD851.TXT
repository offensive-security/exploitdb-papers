Subject: File 2--Re: Australian atty-gen invest'ing Adelaide Inst.'s web site?

The messages I forwarded earlier earlier about the Simon Wiesenthal
Center were accurate:
 http://fight-censorship.dementia.org/dl?num=3089

The Center is up to its same old Internet scare-mongering. Below, Rabbi
Cooper not only decries holocaust revisionists on the Net, he also reminds
the Australian public that students can download bomb-making materials!
(Obviously the state must censor libraries, wherein the same information
can be found.)

According to Cooper, this speech that he personally dislikes is why the
Australian government must crack down on free expression online.

June 20, 1996

HAVANA (Reuter) - Cuban authorities have approved access to
the Internet and other global information networks but will
limit such access according to national interests, official
media said Thursday.
     The ruling Comunist Party newspaper Granma said regulations
adopted earlier this month outlined the need for access to
Internet and other world information networks, while observing
interests such as ``defense and national security.''
     The policy of establishing who had access would be defined
by Cuba's interests, giving priority to individuals and bodies
with most relevance to the country's life and development, the
newspaper said.
     It did not specify who such people might be, but they are
likely to come from approved state organizations and academic
and research centres.
     Information divulged from such global networks should be
trustworthy and in line with Cuba's ``ethical principles'',
Granma said.
     A committee regulating the policy on global information
networks would be drawn from ministries that will include the
Interior Ministry, the Justice Ministry and the Armed Forces
Ministry, Granma said.

[While note exactly net-censorship, I'll still link this in to:
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~declan/international/ --Declan]


BRUSSELS, BELGIUM, 1996 JUN 21 (NB) -- The European Commission (EC) is
urging its members to make sure that English, which already has a
strong position on the World Wide Web, does not become the de facto
language of European online services and Internet systems.

According to Nana Mouskouri, Euro Member of Parliament (MP) and
perhaps best known as the Greek singer of the smash hit of the 1960s,
"Never on a Sunday," the danger is much more than simply seeing
languages other than English falling into disuse on the Internet.

[...]

"I think it's essential that we protect that cultural heritage and
make sure that it's not destroyed by the information society which
would then be an information society with no content," she said.

So far, Mouskouri's campaign has received only the support from the
EC, but there is a possibility that the EC could well turn the support
into a full fledged campaign, backed by European legislation,
something that could have some serious effects on the future of the
Web in Europe.

Interesting concept... -Declan

June 20, 1996

     THE HAGUE, Netherlands (Reuter) - Dutch Justice Minister
Winnie Sorgdrager Thursday opened an Internet site where surfers
on the world-wide web could report child pornography.
     ``The web-site provider will ask the issuer to remove the
child pornography from the Internet and will report them to the
police if they fail to do so,'' she said at the opening of the
site, a self-regulatory service from Internet access providers.
     Child pornography is prohibited under Dutch law and
offenders face jail terms of up to four years.
     Sorgdrager said Dutch input on the Internet formed only a
tiny part of the total. The fight against child pornography
would only succeed if other European Union member states adopted
the idea.
     The Dutch foundation of Internet providers, which maintains
the web-site, said it expected a speedy removal of pornography.
     ``In the start-up phase we tested the method on a Dutch
distributor of child pornography who immediately stopped
publishing images,'' said chairman Felipe Rodriguez.
     ``The web-site will eliminate all on-line child pornography
sent from the Netherlands,'' he said.
     Germany has recently acted against child pornography and
racism on the Internet by banning entire discussion groups. This
method is criticised by web-devotees who say that this violates
their right to free speech.

The following was published yesterday in the Engineer magazine in the
UK under the headline 'DTI plans for secure telecoms' -

                     ----------------------------

"The government has recommended licensing 'trusted third parties' as
conduits of encrypted information sent over public networks.

In a white paper published this week, the Department of Trade and Industry
has floated the plan of offering licenses to software firms 'known to be
trustworthy'.

'It is not the intention of the government to regulate the private use of
encryption' says the white paper.  'It will, however, ensure that
organisations and bodies wishing to provide encryption services to the
public will be appropriately licensed.'

Licensed organisations would allow compamies to send sensitive information
to customers or other offices.  It would, for instance, allow users of the
Internet to send credit card details without the fear of them being picked
up by a hacker.  'Secure electronic commerce between parties will become
possible because they will have confidence in the security andintegrity of
their dealings,' says the paper.

Issues to be resolved include a 'common architectural framework' across
countries, so information can be safely transmitted across boundaries."

Subject--Singapore Internet Regulations

Dave Farber recently returned from a trip to Asia and has been sending
recollections to IP. Read the second half of his note for this graf:

"the Singapore Government is about to publish network content
regulations which ban provider in Singapore from offering material which
is considered offensive to the culture. ISPs (which are only 3 in number
at this time) will be also required to block international URLs which
lead to
sites which contain such offensive information."

I fear Singapore has taken the lead internationally in restricting online
speech. Some of the reports I have at
<http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~declan/international/:

...
 - -Declan

Dear Declan,

I appreciate your material on the Internet but I must say that there are
several aspects of your latest post (repeating some of David Farber's
material) on Singapore's Internet Regulations that I feel need to be
clarified in the interest of a informed discussion.  This is a long note
so those who are not interested have my sincere apologies in advance.

(1) There are 3 IASPs (Internet Access Service Providers) in Singapore
and these are licenced to operate.  I think the number of IASPs will not
be allowed to proliferate.  Before anyone gets on to a soapbox about how
wonderful healthy competition is and that IASPs should be allowed to
propagate like wildflowers, consider the following:

* Singapore is a very small market.  There is a population of 3 million
and geographically, its only about the size of Manhattan island.

* The startup costs of IASPs is not insubstantial.  Apart from the
hardware there is the need for an International Leased Circuit for
Internet access.  T1 lines and up cost a fair bit.  A lot of the
equipment have short lifespan.  For example, I think hundreds of 14.4
modems had to be dumped to put in 28.8 ones last year.

* Having invested such amounts into their infrastructure, it is only
sensible that existing IASPs have some measure of protection from a
free-for-all market.

* Existing IASPs are able to offer fairly competitive prices (bearing in
mind the high costs of the ILC to the US).  Internet accounts are about
$9.95 per month (US$6) for the first 12 hours and then $2.50 per hour
(abt US$1.8).  Service quality is also decent.  One of my IASPs, for
example, has more than a thousand phone lines for dial-up access, with a
ration of dial-up lines to subscribers something in the region of 1:20.
 I believe this is considered to be very decent.  Of course, IASPs in US
can be much cheaper if ads in US Magazines are to be believed.
Nonetheless, I think they are affordable in Singapore, and not unreasonable.

In the premises, I think that the control of IASPs from proliferating is
not necessarily a Bad Thing.  Bear in mind also that there are no
prequalifications or pre-registration requirements for holding Internet
accounts.  Anyone and everyone can apply to get a dial-up account.
 Better to have controls over the number of players in the market, and
therefore assure certain service quality standards, than to allow a
free-for-all with shoddy standards.

(2) I think the position discussed by our policy makers is that sites
with offensive materials should be blocked by IASPs.  If policy makers
determine what these sites are and inform IASPs accordingly, and the list
is not too unmanageable from a technical point of view, this policy is
also justifiable.

HOWEVER, when you superimpose such a policy against a normative
"standard" of freedom-for-all and unrestricted-access, then this policy
would fall afoul of such a set of "norms."  The thing is, that such a
"norm" has never been accepted in Singapore, for better or for worse.
 The position is that controls on media are believed to be necessary.
 Whether or not you agree is not as important as the fact that such
controls are in place and therefore, why not for the Internet?

(3) I am not at all sure that its fair to say that "Singapore has taken
the lead internationally in restricting online speech" -- If you look at
all the materials on-line about restrictions imposed by various countries
on the Internet, from Germany to France to the (mebbe, hopefully
unsuccessful) CDA and all the other details in the recent Human Rights
Watch report, it seems that the "norm" of free unhindered access to
information on the Internet is honoured more in its breach than its
observance.  I have not read the "Singapore leader condemns Net" report
that you have at your website recently and do not recall it much.
 However, I am able to say that on the whole, there is more or less
acceptance of the Internet as a fact of today's society and
communications network.  Our policy makers have emphasised that they see
the benefits of the Internet, but are ever watchful of some of the darker
parts of the Internet.

(4) Contrary to Charlie Mullins response, search engines do not have to
go.  If ultimately the search engine points to a place that is listed as
prohibited e.g. www.websex.com (fictitious, at least I don't know of such
a site), then the fact that the search engine points me to it does not
ultimately allow me to access the site if the site is properly blocked
(either IP level or whatever).  However, as Declan pointed out in an
earlier comment, it would be simple to have an overseas proxy serve out
these web pages without it appearing as if the data came from the
originating site.

(5) Again Charlie Mullins is wrong if he thinks that it is intended that
someone sift through millions of web pages.  However, if a patently
offensive web page is brought to the notice of the powers-that-be (by
users or sheer notoriety), then the appropriate listing of the site as
"banned" could be done.

(6) The powers-that-be have also opined that they recognise that
censorship will not be 100% effective, but that something *has* to be
done if only to make a statement.

Subject: File 8--German computer blackmail attempts

   --------------------------

 Date--Wed, 26 Jun 1996 13:35:25 +0100
 From--frank@artcom.de (Frank Rieger)

 The HERF-against-banks-story from the Sunday Times 3 weeks ago was somewhat
 overhyped and has a lack of facts..  I have collected some facts on real
 blackmail attempts performed in Germany on a much lower, but maybe
 comparable level.

 Since February 1996 until last week a person named Markus S=F6hnke
 Ungerb=FChler was calling German banks and corporations, claiming he was a
 member of the Chaos Computer Club and has hacked the corporate computer
 system. He claimed, that he has his hands on data that proves tax
 manipulations and other illegal activities of this company. He also claimed
 the hacking of several systems in main German press magazines like stern and
 Spiegel.  Ungerb=FChler asked the banks and companies for paying him some
 1000 Deutschmarks for giving them the data "back". Another scheme was to ask
 for payment for removing allegedly planted negative-stories from the press
 computers.  As known by now all of some dozen companies and banks paid in
 panic reaction for avoiding any press coverage. Only a very, very small
 minority of victims asked the police for help - after paying.  In several
 cases Ungerb=FChler handed out some disks with the "data" in exchange for
 the money. These disks were empty.

 Mr. Ungerb=FChler has escaped in February from an psychiatric hospital,
 where he was arrested cause of being an proven schizophrenic and
 blackmailer. He started his activities two days after his getaway. He based
 in London and operated via some Fax- and Voicemail boxes.  The investigation
 of the case was difficult, cause none of the victims was willing to prove
 the identity of the blackmailer for the police etc.  (Ungerb=FChler used to
 show money couriers from the banks his authentic passport to prove he is the
 right person to receive the money)

 He is definitely not a member of the Chaos Computer Club and is, as far as
 known by now, unable to hack into computer systems. He is simply a
 confidence trickster.

 The case shows, how fast and easy big companies pay, if they fear press
 coverage of real or alleged problems. They pay to everyone who believable
 claims to be _able_ to perform hacking or electronic attacks.

 In the light of this case, I could imagine, that around 40 banks in London
 City have paid for being not attacked by HERF - without the real prove, that
 the blackmailers own such weapons. There is a real huge amount of
 irrationality in computer security issues, especially in the financial
 sector. It seems like no one trusts his security measures. As I have learned
 in this case, these security-guys are thinking all the time in a worst-case
 manner and if the worst case occurs they are unable to react rational. You
 did not need Schwartau-style doomsday-weapons for getting lots of money - ou
 only have to be eloquent and know the right buzzwords.  Finally the
 Ungerb=FChler-case was mainly fixed cause of massive activities of an
 well-known international security company paid by one of the victims, not
 cause of so good cooperation between police and the victims.

             Justice Department files appeal, Supreme Court ho!
      ---------------
         By Declan McCullagh / declan@well.com / Redistribute freely
      ---------------

In this dispatch: Justice Department's appeal means long, tortuous process
                  A mysterious "Order on Motion for Clarification"
                  Text of Justice Department's Notice of Appeal


July 2, 1996

WASHINGTON, DC -- The Department of Justice yesterday appealed the
Philadelphia court's decision striking down the Communications Decency
Act, a move that sets the stage for a long, tortuous climb to the
Supreme Court.

The government's "Notice of Appeal" is a terse, two-page statement
saying they "hereby appeal" the "Adjudication and Order entered June
12," the day the special three-judge panel unanimously declared the CDA
to be unconstitutional and blocked the Justice Department from
enforcing it.

Next move is the DoJ's. They have until September 1 to file a
"jurisdictional statement" arguing that the Supreme Court should hear
their appeal.

The Supreme Court doesn't automatically have to accept jurisdiction,
notes Ann Beeson, an attorney with the ACLU. "The Supreme Court can
still decline to exercise jurisdiction over the case," she says,
adding: "They do not have the same kind of discretion they have in
a cert petition."

All the DoJ has to do is convince the Supremes that there's "still a
substantial federal question," says Beeson. "If they're not convinced
there is a question, they can decline the appeal."

But by all accounts, there's precious little chance of that happening.

After Justice files the jurisdictional statement, our attorneys have 30
days to file a response -- and then when the next term begins on October
7, the Supremes will meet to discuss the case. (If the procedure is
anything like granting cert, the votes will be cast in a secret
conference attended only by the justices and the actual vote won't be
disclosed.)

The climb to the nation's highest court will be only partly over by
then, since the court's decision to consider our case marks the start of
the briefing schedule. The government will have 45 more days to file
their arguments saying why the Philadelphia decision was wrong; we have
30 more days to rebut.

If the Department of Justice -- hardly the speediest bureaucracy in DC
-- uses all of their alloted time, the paperwork won't be complete
until Christmas.

And then the Supremes need plenty of time to digest it.

So everyone's best guess is that the Supreme Court will hear the
combined ACLU and ALA coalition lawsuits early next year -- just in
time for the rescheduled Electronic Freedom March on the nation's
Capitol.

As I wrote in a recent HotWired column:

  "The ACLU predicts the Supreme Court will issue a decision near the
   close of the next term, which ends in July 1997 -- just in time for

            THE MYSTERIOUS "ORDER ON MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION"
+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+

You might be surprised by a mysterious sentence in the text of the
Justice Department's notice of appeal talking about a "Order on Motion
for Clarification" the court issued on June 28.

Not to worry. The judges ruled so vigorously in our favor that the DoJ
wanted to be sure the government could prosecute anyone they think
may violate other parts of the CDA.

"Because of the wording of the court's actual order, they unwittingly
called into question whether the DoJ could enforce the provisions of
the CDA that we didn't challenge," says Ann Beeson from the ACLU.

The Philadelphia court quickly issued the clarification.

MEA CULPA. In F-C Dispatch #13, I wrote that the Washington Post ran an
article "on the first page of the Outlook section bashing
"self-indulgent dross" and "crap" on the Net. I neglected to mention
that John Schwartz and Kara Swisher had an excellent rebuttal inside.
