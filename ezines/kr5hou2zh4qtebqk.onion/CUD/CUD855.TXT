This is a speech on internet censorship given by the managing director of
the Dutch Internet Service Provider which created the child pornography
"hotline" that I forwarded about a month ago.

A lecture i gave at the international liberals congress:


Hello,

I am Felipe Rodriquez, Managing director of Xs4all Internet, a mayor
dutch provider, and Im also chairman of the dutch foundation of
internet providers.

I was asked to do a short lecture about Internet and censorship.

Internet is an emerging market, and at the same time an exciting new
social environment. A space of communications between people of
different nations, with different habits, traditions and legal codes.

Internet is a place without borders. Information travels from one
country to another in a split second. From here to the United States it
takes 100 milliseconds. To Japan the information travels within 300
milliseconds. Nicaragua takes 250 milliseconds and to Australia it
takes the bits and bytes 400 milliseconds. Information crosses many
borders on its path to the final destination.

This challenges the concept of regionally defined cultures. The world
becomes a global village of many cultures. Those cultures are not
necessarily confined to a certain region or location. They are on the
Net, and thus independent of location.

The environment and conditions on the Net change quickly. New
possibilities of communicating with other people emerge on an almost
daily basis. Today people can sound-talk over the Internet, play games
together, send pictures, send video transmissions, radio et cetera.
Never before have people been communicating so massively, on an
intenational scale. Every person is a medium that generates network
traffic.

This mash of global cultures, all communicating with eachother, creates
a culture shock.  Every culture has its own traditions and codes, and
naturally tries to protect and nurture these values.The traditional way
of protecting ones culture and traditions has always been through
legislation and social control. It is legislation that now threatens
most of the worldwide cultures on Internet.

Legislation on Internet is a slippery road. A communication technology
on this scale is a new concept.  It is difficult to legislate a global
social environment. The main problem is the fact that countries try to
legislate a global environment through their own culturally defined
moral codes.

Different things are allowed in different countries. In the US it is
allowed to make racist comments, in Holland it is not. So you see a
migration of the information that dutch neo-nazi groups put on the
Internet. Vice versa the United States has strict laws against
obsenity, that are much more tolerant in Holland. Now you see a
migration of pornographic material towards Holland. From both countries
the information is published on a world wide scale. Implementation of
law for Internet should include a harmonisation of some kind in the
area of international legislation.

The United States has implemented the Communications Decency Act. This
law defines unacceptable speech on Internet. You can be criminally
prosecuted for saying the word fuck or other indecent words, if you are
an American. Anything indecent is being supressed. This proves to be a
law that is impossible to uphold.

The United States government webservers violate the Communications
Decency Act. On the White House webserver there is a picture of a
painting that is displayed. The painting shows a family of a mother
with her two children. One of the children is nude. According to the
Decency Act it is forbidden to display this image on the Internet.
There are similar examples on other government systems in the US.

This communications decency act is now being challenged as being
unconstitutional by a group of organisations on Internet that has more
than 40.000 supporters.

Other countries like China, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia have even stricter
guidelines for Internet. No one can use the Internet without prior
government permission. These governments introduce strict control on
the gateways that connect them to the Net.  These countries are afraid
that Internet will give their citizens access to information against
their government and political structure. The Internet is too
democratic for them.

Germany had ordered Compuserve to block off all groups about sex, and
Compuserve then had no other way to shut these groupsdown worldwide.
Eventually the german ambassador had to explain this action to
President Clinton. A local law was influencing cultures in other
countries.

France arrested two internet-providers a couple of weeks ago. They
where held responsible for the publication of child-pornography that
was foumd on the Net. They did not distribute it themselves, but it was
available somewhere on Internet. After global concern, the french
minister of Interior admitted the arrests where a mistake, and that the
providers could not be held liable.

Prudence is needed because experience must first be aquired. You cannot
legislate something you do not know anything about, but it happens
everywhere on Internet.  Resulting in unworkable situations, and
repression of the people and the market.

Many problems on Internet can be dealt with today. One of those
problems is Child Pornography. In Holland we have started a hotline
against child pornography on Internet. If we get a report about a dutch
user that is transmitting child-pornography, then we send him a
warning. If that does not stop him, we report that user to the police.
The user gets his chance to test the legal system. The hotline does not
censor, it warns and reports.  This project is a cooperation between
the foundation of dutch internetproviders, the dutch criminal
intelligence agency, a psychologist, a couple of internet users and the
national bureau against racial discrimination.  The hotline is based on
existing law, and proves that no extra law is needed to fight
child-pornography on Internet. Im a firm believer of first trying all
the intruments that the existing legislation has to offer. Why bother
about new laws if existing rules are sufficient ?

One of the common concerns is the availabality of  obscene and violent
information to children. This is the main argument in the United Stated
to impose strict rules for the Net. But there are already techniques
that can protect children from seeing any these materials. There is
software that is especially made for the purpose of creating a safe
Internet. There is a demand from the market to create these programs,
and thus they are created.

Protection of the children on the Net is not a government task, but an
educational task of the parents of the children. Instead of regulating
a worldwide network one could also think of imposing an age limit.

Pridence is needed to find solutions for these new problems. Business
can only thrive in a stable environment. And rushing in all kinds of
repressive measures is not a stabilising factor. It is often easier to
impose new legislation, than it is to repair old bad legislation.

Thank you !

Subject: File 2--"Cyber-Rights" Platform Plank - FINAL DISCUSSION PERIOD (fwd)

You've probably already seen this elsewhere, but I figured I'd send it
your way directly.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Christopher D. Frankonis - Rootless Cosmopolitan
                                      cyberPOLIS - Communicate This Culture

                                        Draft "Cyber-Rights" Platform Plank
                       http://www.cypher.net/cyberPOLIS/platform-plank.html


---------- Forwarded message ----------

Submissions of platform proposals to both the Democratic and Republican
Parties are due by the first week of August. The Libertarians have already
held their convention, but will receive a copy of this plank proposal
anyway, as will Perot's Reform Party if it can ever be determined who to
send it to.

Therefore, I am opening a final period of discussion on the proposed
"cyber-rights" platform plank -- beginning at the start of Sunday, July
14, and ending at the close of Wednesday, July 17.

Please try to focus the discussion in the following locations (although I
will be tracking the entire handful of lists and groups this announcement
is being posted to):

    the Bonfire mailing list
      (see http://www.well.com/user/jonl/bonfire.html)
    the cyberPOLIS mailing list
      (see http://www.cypher.net/cyberPOLIS/discussion.html)
    alt.culture.internet
    alt.politics.datahighway
    comp.org.eff.talk

At the close of the final discussion period, the draft platform plank will
be considered to be in a fixed state; development will be over.

For the two weeks between Wednesday, July 17, and Wednesday, July 31, an
email address will be made available for collecting the names of
individuals and groups which wish to signify their support for the plank.
The collection of names will be appended to the plank proposal, and sent
along with the text of the plank to each of the four parties being
targeted. Note: Do NOT send me any of this now. When the time comes, I
will announce the appropriate address.

And so, without further explanation, here is the current version (the
2nd, in fact) of the proposed "cyber-rights" platform plank:


               [ Respect for Freedom in the Information Age ]

   "As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the
   Internet deserves the highest protection from government intrusion."

   - Judge Stewart Dalzell

   The [BLANK] Party takes special recognition of the unique
   characteristics of computer-mediated communication. As the nation and
   the world experience the Information Revolution, we must rise to the
   challenge of embracing the achievements and the promise of the global
   Internet.

   To this end, we affirm that the new world of cyberspace calls for a
   commitment to these essential values of American liberty:

     * The right to speak, express oneself, and associate freely.
     * The right to privacy, whether through the use of anonymity,
       pseudonymity, encryption, or other means.
     * The right of the individual to control both the information they
       access and the information they provide.

   As the people of America and those of nations around the world come
   closer together through the power of computer networking, the [BLANK]
   Party embraces the spirit of freedom embodied by this new medium.

Subject: File 4--Re: Response to CUD re: selling wind

To: Roland Dobbins,

Seems to me that CUD is being about as balanced as usual.  They
published your "right-wing rant", just as they published the
"left-wing rant" you were objecting to.

You are quite correct about the "liberal" Clinton administration
trying to foist key-escrow (like Clipper), "anti-terrorism"
legislation that uses guilt-by-association, and has violated the
rights of individuals in their quest to force various "militias" to
submit.  (Although I'm not sure that the Clinton admin can really be
blamed for Ruby Ridge -- that was already planned before he took
office, and bureaucracies have a certain inertia.)  In any case, if
they are to be blamed for the idiocies at Ruby Ridge and Waco, they
are equally entitled to take credit for learning from past mistakes
and working out a negotiated settlement with the "Free Men".

I'm not sure about "filegate".  Maybe it's an enemies list.  But it
seems just as likely to me (a computer professional) that it resulted
from somebody searching an outdated list of white-house employees.
Seems to me if Clinton wanted to keep an enemies list, he could have
picked a better list than a bunch of former white-house employees and
applicants.  However, I maintain an open mind on this, as additional
evidence may turn at any time.

But I really must take issue with your bringing up SDI.  Yes, weapons
are made to be used.  That's one reason why we maintained and continue
to maintain our own weapons.  It lets any foreign power who might think
of using such weapons on the U.S. know that the result will be the total
destruction of whatever country they are ruling.

But the SDI was, and remains, a chimera.  Vaporware, impossible to
build.  I just happen to have a relevant LA Times column, which I will
quote part of:

    David L. Parnas(1) spent two days listening to Air Force
    briefings, then in June 1985 he resigned from the advisory panel,
    concluding that the fundamental computer requirements for
    strategic defense could never be satisfied.

    ...

    His basic points are simple and unalterable:  By its nature,
    strategic ballistic missile defense cannot be tested in its
    conditions of use -- we can't fire a missile at Los Angeles
    to see if our defense works.  And no computer system of even
    modest complexity has ever been considered reliable without
    extensive testing in actual conditions of use.
    ...
    National ballistic missile defense, of course, would require
    computer software of both unimaginable(sic) complexity and
    infallible trustworthiness -- and it would have to work
    correctly the first time it was ever used.

    ...

    Furthermore, the long lead time and elaborate facilities
    required to build an intercontinental missile mean that the
    U.S. and its allies would be able to deal with such a threat(2)
    from a rogue state in others(sic) ways -- via a preemptive
    strike, for example.

Above quoted from "Innovation" column, by Gary Chapman, Los Angeles
Times, Monday, July 8, 1996, page D6.

I note that Chapman ignores the many missiles left in the former
Soviet Union.  These are mostly controlled by the Russian military,
regardless of where they are physically located.  And Russia seems to
have other things than intercontinental war on its mind.  This could
change in the future, of course.  But I suspect it would be cheaper to
just buy the missiles than to build even the prototype SDI ($31-60
billion; we have spent over "$100 billion on ... research so far, without
noticeable progress."(ibid))

Also ignored by proponents of SDI is that there are other methods of
delivering weapons of mass destruction than ICBMs.  If Russia _did_
become a threat again, they could use submarine-launched missiles,
which are harder to defend against because they travel tens or hundreds
of miles instead of thousands.  And the smaller "rogue states" that
indulge in terrorism could get quite satisfactory results by smuggling
the weapons into the U.S. and assembling them in whichever city they
want to destroy.

It would be difficult to completely destroy the U.S. with short range
or smuggled in weapons, but you could certainly deliver a lot of
terror, just the sort of thing those dictators would enjoy.  Except
for one thing -- the retaliatory strike would leave them radioactive
dust, or if they happened to have a deep enough bunker to survive it,
no army and a radioactive wasteland to "rule" over.  The same thing
would happen to anyone who launched a more massive missile strike, of
course.

So, who are we to fear?  Anyone who is weighing risks against gains
will see there is nothing to be gained by using such weapons against
U.S. territory.  And in spite of propaganda labelling Hussein and
Kaddafi "madmen", they are quite sane, just working from goals we
don't understand.  And if someone crazy does come to power (Hitler,
perhaps), SDI will not prevent him from smuggling in weapons.

In fact, assuming such a ruler (or a stateless terrorist group for
that matter) could lay hands on enough fissionables, this would be at
least as efficient a method of using them as launching missiles.
Missiles have a way of failing, their payloads refusing to go off.
Worse, after you've figured out how to build a fission bomb (not that
difficult, most of the info is now available in libraries), you
_still_ have to figure out how to build the missiles, a much more
difficult task.  (Or spend a lot of money to buy them, then hope you
can maintain them in working condition until its time to use them.)

Thank you, I'd rather use the 31-60 billion to lower taxes or reduce
the national debt.

Subject: File 5--NYT -- IRC-based child molestation ring busted (7/17/96)

The New York Times, July 17, 1996, p. A10.

16 Indicted On Charges Of Internet Pornography
Allegations of Molestation Are Also Filed

By Tim Golden

   San Jose, Calif., July 16 -- [...]

   Today, Federal officials said the girl in a small central
   California town had led them to one of the more distant
   frontiers of sexual crime.

   In an indictment handed up here, a Federal grand jury
   charged 16 people in the United States and abroad with
   joining in a pornography ring that was effectively an
   on-line pedophilia club. Its members shared homemade
   pictures, recounted their sexual experiences with children
   and even chatted electronically as two of the men molested
   a 10-year-old girl, the authorities said.

   The case appeared likely to heighten concerns about the
   spread of child pornography over the Internet. Debate has
   grown steadily over whether or how the government should
   impose obscenity standards in cyberspace, and Republican
   leaders have increasingly attacked the Clinton
   Administration for being insufficiently vigorous in the
   prosecution of on-line pornography cases.

[...]

   In addition to 13 men arrested around the United States,
   officials said the group included members in Finland,
   Canada and Australia. Although arrest warrants have been
   issued for those three, officials said they were still only
   known by their computer aliases.

[...]

   With help from Customs Service investigators in Silicon
   Valley, F.B.I. agents eventually uncovered computer files
   that began to trace the scope of the Orchid Club, one of
   the thousands of virtual conference rooms of Internet Relay
   Chat.
   Officials said they did not have to conduct wire-tap
   surveillance or break into encrypted files; two of the
   accused conspirators collaborated with investigators, going
   on-line in the presence of law-enforcement agents to help
   track other members of the club.

Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, which is financed
through the Defense Department, will play a major role in developing the new
interagency group, which will handle security concerns related to the

cellular calling and satellite TV.  The company's primary strategy is to
sign up millions of customers for its WorldNet Internet access service.  The
company will also provide its corporate customers a "hosting" service called
EasyCommerce, which will create and operate corporate Web sites.  At the

Hackers $50K challenge to break Net security system

World Star Holdings in Winnipeg, Canada is looking for
trouble. If they find it, they're willing to pay $50,000 to the
first person who can break their security system. The
company has issued an open invitation to take the "World
Star Cybertest '96: The Ultimate Internet Security Challenge,"
in order to demonstrate the Company's Internet security
system.

Personal email challenges have been sent to high profile
names such as Bill Gates, Ken Rowe at the National Center
for Super Computing, Dr. Paul Penfield, Department of
Computer Science at the M.I.T. School of Engineering and
researchers Drew Dean and Dean Wallach of Princeton
University.

OBT's paid subscription newsletter Online Business
Consultant has recently quoted the Princeton team in several
Java security reports including "Deadly Black Widow On The
Web: Her Name is JAVA," "Java Black Widows---Sun
Declares War," Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid" and "The
Business Assassin."  To read these reports go to Home Page
Press http://www.hpp.com and scroll down the front page.

Brian Greenberg, President of World Star said, "I personally
signed, sealed and emailed the invitations and am very
anxious to see some of the individuals respond to the
challenge. I am confident that our system is, at this time, the
most secure in cyberspace."

World Star Holdings, Ltd., is a provider of interactive
"transactable" Internet services and Internet security
technology which Greenberg claims has been proven
impenetrable. The Company launched its online contest
offering more than $50,000 in cash and prizes to the first
person able to break its security system.

According to the test's scenario hackers are enticed into a
virtual bank interior in search of a vault. The challenge is to
unlock it and find a list of prizes with inventory numbers and
a hidden "cyberkey" number.  OBT staff used Home Page
Press's Go.Fetch (beta) personal agent software to retrieve the
World Star site and was returned only five pages.

If you're successful, call World Star at 204-943-2256.  Get to
it hackers.  Bust into World Star at http://205.200.247.10 to
get the cash!

Subject: File 8--Access control, Censorship, and Precision

For me, the most disturbing part of the Meeks story about control of
access to parts of the Internet was the allegation of a lack of
precision in defining controlled sites, so that sites with a similar,
but not identical, URL could be blocked.

I imagine that a smart lawyer could make a case for damages out of that
one.

Contrast it with the iSTAR story.  The list of newsgroups they have
refused to handle is pretty clear, and while different countries, even
different States in the USA, have different limits, pretty well all of
the newsgroups have names which strongly suggest an illegal content in
many jurisdictions.

About the only one which I was surprised to see was the newsgroup for
pictures of cheerleaders, but on an international network of networks,
it isn't hard to find differences in age limits, which would make a
picture of a 17-year-old legal in one country, and illegal in another.

At least the censors and controllers have a reason for their actions,
and one which I believe can be defended.  The danger in both the stories
is that so much is being done in secret, and these actions should be
challenged, should be publically debated, rather than imposed in secret.

Here in the UK we have what is officially a film _classification_
system, backed by law.  Mostly, it seems to work pretty well.  There are
stories about scenes being cut from films to get a less restrictive
classification.  It has also been claimed that no film can be released
in the UK which shows the use of nunchaku, because of some decision
taken by the current head of the BBFC.

It can be argued that too many people on the Internet fail to accept
responsibility for what they make available.  The scary thing about the
secrecy surrounding efforts to classify or censor material, is that it
suggests that the people taking the decisions are afraid to accept their
responsibilities.
