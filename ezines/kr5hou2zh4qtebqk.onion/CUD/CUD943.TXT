Subject: File 1--Alert: Two Anti-Spam Bills in Congress; One Good, One Bad

There are two anti-spam bills in progress now.  One is an "opt-out"
bill filed earlier this week by Sen. Murkowski of Alaska.  The other
is an "opt-in" amendment to the existing junk fax law to be filed
shortly by Rep.  Chris Smith of New Jersey.

Both bills attempt to address the problems of spam, but unfortunately
the Murkowski bill has several critical flaws that both make it
ineffective and would impose huge extra costs on ISPs.  Fortunately
the Smith bill has none of these problems.

The Murkowski bill:

* Requires that advertisements be tagged "advertisement" and have valid
contact info.

* Requires that each advertiser maintain an opt-out list, with a 48 hour
window permitted before acting on an opt-out request.

* Requires that all ISPs provide filtering on incoming mail, with
substantial fines if they don't.

* Prescribes a variety of remedies, including a cumbersome proceeding before
the Federal Trade Commission for ISPs accused of harboring spammers.

The full text of the Murkowski bill is on the senator's web site at
<http://www.senate.gov/~murkowski/press/EMail052197.html>.

This could be a disaster for ISPs.  It does nothing to address the
costs that spammers put on ISPs now, and adds unfunded mandates by
requiring filtering of mail that nobody wanted in the first place.  It
also makes spam clearly legal, so the amount of spam will greatly
increase.

We already know the reasons opt-out doesn't work: each tiny spammer
starts with an empty opt-out list, and they have an incentive to keep
lousy records and lose opt-out requests.  The simple filtering that
the bill mandates would exclude all advertising mail, so it makes it
much more difficult for existing legitimate opt-in businesses to
operate since their mail would be filtered, too.

The Smith bill, in contrast, is a short amendment to 47 USC 227, the
existing junk fax law, to make unsolicited commercial e-mail illegal,
with the same $500 civil penalty as currently applies to junk fax.  It
puts no new requirements on ISPs.  Rather, it makes it incumbent on
advertisers to sign up people affirmatively and to keep careful
records of opt-in requests, so the advertisers bear the bulk of the
cost.  Legitimate e-mail advertisers already do these things.

What you need to do:

* Particularly if you run an ISP or other Internet-related business,
call your representative and ask him or her to support and ideally
co-sponsor the Smith bill.  Tell him why the Murkowski bill would be
bad for your business.

* Senator Murkowski has asked for e-mail comments at
commercialemail@murkowski.senate.gov.  Remember, his goals are
laudable, it's the implementation that has problems.  Encourage him to
adopt the language of the Smith bill.

Incidentally, I hear that Cyber Promotions supports the Murkowski bill.

Subject: File 2--Text of S. 771 (Senate version of Anti-Spam bill)


   Please note throughout S. 771,
   Commission refers to the Federal Trade Commission,
   not the Federal Communications Commission

                               S. 771 BILL TEXT



    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
   United States of America in Congress assembled,

   SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

   This Act may be cited as the ``Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail
   Choice Act of 1997''.

   SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

   Congress makes the following findings:

   (1) The Internet is a worldwide network of information that growing
   numbers of Americans use on a regular basis for educational and
   personal activities.

   (2) Electronic mail messages transmitted on the Internet constitute an
   increasing percentage of communications in the United States.

   (3) Solicited commercial electronic mail is a useful and
   cost-effective means for Americans to receive information about a
   business and its products.

   (4) The number of transmissions of unsolicited commercial electronic
   mail advertisements has grown exponentially over the past several
   years as the technology for creating and transmitting such
   advertisements in bulk has made the costs of distribution of such
   advertisements minimal.

   (5) Individuals have available no effective means of differentiating
   between unsolicited commercial electronic mail advertisements and
   other Internet communications.

   (6) The transmitters of unsolicited commercial electronic mail
   advertisements can easily move from State to State.

   (7) Individuals and businesses that receive unsolicited commercial
   electronic mail advertisements often pay for the costs of such receipt
   ,including the costs of Internet access and long distance telephone
   charges.

   (8) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be used to advertise
   legitimate services and goods but is also used for fraudulent and
   deceptive purposes in violation of Federal and State law.

   (9) Individuals and companies that use unsolicited commercial
   electronic mail for fraudulent and deceptive purposes often use
   fraudulent identification information in such electronic mail, making
   it impossible for a recipient to request to be removed from the
   mailing list or for law enforcement authorities to identify the
   sender.

   (10) The inability of recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic
   mail to identify the senders of such electronic mail or to prevent its
   receipt impedes the flow of commerce and communication on the Internet
   and threatens the integrity of commerce on the Internet.

   (11) Internet service providers are burdened by the cost of equipment
   necessary to process unsolicited commercial electronic mail.

   (12) To facilitate the development of commerce and communication on
   the Internet, unsolicited commercial electronic mail should be readily
   identifiable and filterable by individuals and Internet service
   providers.

   SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO TRANSMISSIONS OF UNSOLICITED
   COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC MAIL.

   (a) Information on Advertisement.

       witnesses or the production of documentary or other evidence.

       alleged violation of any civil or criminal statute of the State
       concerned.
