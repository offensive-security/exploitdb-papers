Conference Background
---------------------
WebNet is the annual conference of the WebSociety that was founded in 1995
out of a concern that an organisation addressing the application aspects of
the Web and representing a lobby for Web users independent of specific
platforms and without the domination of commercial organisations was needed.
The WebSociety complements existing other bodies such as the Internet
Society and W3C. The former is, by definition, more concerned with
providing global Internet services than anything else and the latter is
specifically oriented towards one particular system WWW. The Web Society
and hence WebNet takes a more general view, dealing with a variety of
modern Internet tools and their integration including services such as
Gopher, WWW, Hyper-G, WAIS, directory services, FTP, email and cooperative
applications and novel approaches from Hot Java to VRML, from Web compatible
teaching modules to 3D interfaces.

        O'REILLY RELEASES "COMPUTER USER'S SURVIVAL GUIDE"

SEBASTOPOL, CA--Joan Stigliani traveled the world for four years in
search of information that would help computer users stay healthy. She
interviewed practitioners of conventional and alternative
medicine--physical, occupational, and massage therapists,
psychologists, ergonomics researchers, research scientists, equipment
developers, and computer users. Stigliani's findings are presented in
her breakthrough guide to healthy computing, "The Computer User's
Survival Guide: Staying Healthy in a High Tech World," just released by
O'Reilly & Associates. The most comprehensive computer health manual,
it is also the first to incorporate a holistic approach to dealing with
computer users' complex, interrelated, and proliferating ailments.

"This is the most comprehensive, well thought-out and user-friendly
book I have read on RSI," said Ruth Lowengart, MD, MSOM, Assistant
Clinical Professor at the University of California San Francisco School
of Medicine. "Joan Stigliani brings in information on the cutting edge
of what we are just beginning to understand about these disorders."

"The Computer User's Survival Guide" looks squarely at all the factors
that affect home and work computer users' health, including
positioning, equipment, work habits, lighting, stress, radiation, and
general health. Through this guide readers will learn:

> a continuum of neutral postures that they can utilize at different

work tasks

> how radiation drops off with distance and what electrical equipment

is responsible for most exposure

>  how modern office lighting is better suited to working on paper than

on a screen, and what they can do to prevent glare

>  simple breathing techniques and stretches to keep their body well

oxygenated and relaxed, even when they sit all day

>  how reading from a screen puts unique strains on their eyes and what

kind of vision breaks will keep them most productive and rested

> whats going on "under the skin" when their hands and arms spend much

of the day mousing and typing, and how they can apply that knowledge to
prevent overuse injuries

This is not a book of gloom and doom. It is a user's guide to
protecting oneself against health risks from the computer, while
boosting effectiveness and enjoyment of work. It is a most practical
guide, as well. As Caroline Rose, editor of the RSI Network said, "A
single one of its many useful tips can make a world of difference in
the reader's physical and mental well-being."

    SPEED: AN ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY, MEDIA AND SOCIETY

                   CALL FOR PAPERS, October 1995

_SPEED_ provides a forum for the critical investigation of
technology, mediaz and society. Our intention is to contribute toward
a democratic discourse of technology and media, one that is always
focused upon the material conditions of life that technologies and
media constitute and demand, and yet does not lose sight of the
power of ideas to change those conditions. We feel that as media of
various kinds become more ubiquitous, what it means to live with
and talk about a "medium" changes and expands, and so do the
critical vocabularies of interpreting what those transformations
indicate. Our primary goal in that effort is to foster a cross-
fertilization of ideas between communities of people in the
"academy" and "industry" too often separated, not by interest or
common concern, but by artificially imposed disciplinary and
organizational boundaries. We think that _SPEED_ is a promising
step toward making these institutional boundaries more permeable,
and a critical politics of "mediated sociality" more powerful.

Upcoming issues for which we are currently reviewing abstracts and
submissions:

SPEED 1.3: AIRPORTS AND MALLS

Publicity, it seems, is always a matter of circulation. Likewise,
circulation finds itself as a matter of publicity. What then is the
circulation of publicity in a "private space," like a mall or airport?
Where is the social located, if at all? Is it completely a matter of
trajectory, velocity and disappearance; is it or is it not an even more
sinister militarization of what used to be called the "civilian sector?"
"Malls," whether near a highway off-ramp, or an "information
superhighway" off-ramp, are more than architectural generica, they
are nodes in the global circulation of commodities, culture and
community. Malls as "places," are where some people go to be
amongst the fruits of other people's invisible labor. "Airports" as
"places," are where some people go to be themselves circulated
amongst networks of global circulation, as the content of
transportation-as-medium. We are currently reviewing abstracts for
inclusion in a special transmission of _SPEED_ (non-fiction, fiction,
both; www-specific projects encouraged) that will help answer some
of these questions and conundrums.

SPEED 1.4: SPECIAL ISSUE: ON PAUL VIRILIO

We are currently reviewing abstracts and proposals for articles for a
future transmission of _SPEED_ (WWW-specific projects encouraged)
on the critical significance of the work of Paul Virilio. In extremely
diverse arenas Virilio's cybernetic systems theory of the social has
arranged the horizons of wildly unlikely moments of questioning.
As his vision of interpretation/accusation crosses the spectrum of
disciplinary knowledges (while being at "home" in none), we now
hear literary critics speaking of the military origins of the city-
state, newscasters phrasing a "Nintendo War," historians of science
commenting on the phenomenology of electronic banking,
architectural theorists conceiving "the velocity" of airport space,
and computer industry professionals discussing the political history
of the film projector. Certainly these peculiar arrangements are not to
be entirely credited to (blamed on?) Virilio, but they do suggest that
his vocabulary is significant beyond the relatively narrow concerns
of a "Virilio Studies." We hope, therefore, to both interrogate and
expand what it is possible to make "Virilio" say.

HOW TO GET _SPEED_

_SPEED_ can be accessed and/or downloaded several different
ways: 1) World-Wide-Web; 2) Anonymous ftp; or 3) Gopher.

1. To Get _SPEED_ via World-Wide-Web just open the following
URL from within your favorite Web-browser:
http://www.arts.ucsb.edu/~speed

2. To get _SPEED_ via Anonymous ftp just type the following at
your local prompt: ftp alishaw.ucsb.edu

--when asked for a login name type: anonymous

--when asked for a password type the first part of your e-mail
address. For
example: myname@nowhere.pcp

--change directories by typing: cd /pub/_SPEED_

--at the ftp> prompt you can type the normal "get" and "put"
commands. For example: get _SPEED_1.2 (or: mget* to get the whole
directory)

3. To get _SPEED_ via Gopher just type the following at your local
prompt: gopher alishaw.ucsb.edu (you can also type in the IP
address directly as follows: gopher 128.111.222.10)

Once there, you will see the familiar Gopher menu structure with
_SPEED_ being one of your options. At that point you can choose to
browse individual items, or mail them to yourself and/or others.

(You have to Gopher directly to us because the Social Science
Computing Facility at U.C.S.B. where _SPEED_ is archived is not a
registered Gopher server. That's why if you happen to be looking
for _SPEED_ over your regular Gopher server you won't have much
luck finding it. _SPEED_ uses roughly a 65-character line, so your
margins should be set accordingly. Set your font type to Courier, 9pt
if you want to retain formatting after downloading.)
