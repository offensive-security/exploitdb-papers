Subject: Intro to Biblio and ResourcesModerators' Corner

We continually receive requests for information about studies, 'zines
and people doing research on cyber issues.  The number of works
appearing in the past two years has dramatically increased. Below is a
select bibliography of some of the oft-cited works. We tried to be
representative rather than inclusive, and selected articles, stories,
or publications that include references to other works or that are
considered classics and must be read to understand the CU. Some
readers may questions the selection or why we excluded particular
items in favor of others. If any glaring omissions occur, send over
your choices and we will add a supplement in a few weeks.

Subject: Dissertations and Theses

The following come from International Dissertation Abstracts and from
persons who responded to our request for information on theses. The
dissertation list should be fairly complete. It excludes works limited
to computer crime or computer-mediated communication (contact Bitnet's
CMC newsgroup for information on CMC). The thesis list is incomplete
because of the relatively low number of institutions responding. But,
judging from bibliographies and discussions, there seem to be
relatively few CU-related theses. ("Dissertations" are normally done
for a PhD, and "theses" are written for a Master's degree).

changes and prospects for early nineties.  Contact:
WCURRAN@CARAT.ARIZONA.EDU

Mark Smith (Sociology, University of California, Los Angeles).
Dissertation (in progress) that focuses on the power and politics of the
"information society".  Recurring themes include the role of time/space
compression and surveillance in society.  Significant influences include

includes the clash between Enlightenment rhetoric and post-modern
technology.  Contact: SMITHM@DUVM.BITNET

Elizabeth M. Reid (University of Melbourne). Supervisor: Donna
Merwick.  Honours Thesis on computer-Mediated Communication
communication processes in synchronous conferencing, including
computer networks, internet, and electronic mail.  The focus is on
cultural themes of communication, including power, interpreting social

and their computer security industry counterparts.  Examines the issue
of technological determinism and the "information revolution" and also
the idea of hackers being perhaps an extension or most recent
development of an alternative culture. It also raises the whole issue of
the exact nature of cyberspace and the implications it holds: Are we
entering a new realm of informational colonialism? What is information?
Who has rights over it, and are hackers/the computer underground
fighting a battle of principle the importance of which has passed most
people by?  Contact:  "p.a.taylor@edinburgh.ac.uk"

Robert Berry (U. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Journalism).  M.A.
Thesis on the First Amendment implications of computer-based
communication technologies.  The focus includes a political analysis
of the history of governmental harassment of hackers and how that
harassment threatens to infringe the First Amendment rights associated
with this new technology.  The analysis centers around Operation Sun
Devil and the related prosecutions that have taken place during the
past few years.  Contact: rrberry@SHELTIE.CHAPEL-HILL.NC.US
