<SARAH>                Welcome, Ken! We're glad to have you here. ga
<[Mitch] MITCHWAGNER>  Hi, Ken. Could you give a brief rundown of your
                       experience? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        OK. Hi everyone. Let me introduce myself. I am an
                       Asst DA in Westchester County, NY (just north of NYC).
                       I do fraud cases, with a speciality in tech crimes.
                       Whatever you would like to talk about is ok with me.
                       I have been a prosecutor for 12 years, and helped
                       write the NY computer crime laws.
<SARAH>                What kinds of tech crimes, Ken? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        I do telephone fraud and computer crimes, ranging
                       from intrusions to theft of developmental software.
                       ga
<SARAH>                Theft of developmental software? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Yes, I have had two investigations in which it was
                       alleged that person A stole software developed by
                       person B. B claimed it was worth zillions. ga
<[AmigaNut] JABBA>     Ken, any comments/opinion on the controversial
                       "Clipper Chip" proposal?
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Well, we are a bit out of my league, but I share many
                       of the concerns that have appeared in the media: why
                       the secret development? why no public debate over
                       adoption, etc. ga
<[AmigaNut] JABBA>     How about your view of the necessity of such a thing
                       for law enforcement?
<[ken] GUEST-3>        If I may be so bold, I think what you and others are
                       really asking is if the need to tap any and all
                       communications is a necessary skill for LE. That is a
                       societal balancing act. What LE can do helps it fight
                       crime. It also raises the spectre of abuse.  And that
                       can be scary. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      LE = Law Enforcement
<SARAH>                More on Jabba's question, how often would you say you
                       might have need of a phone tap on a scrambled phone?
                       ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Not to be flippant, but whenever the bad guys use a
                       scrambled phone. Actually, there are relatively few
                       crimes for which taps are allowed, and the number
                       varies state by state. There is no hard data yet on
                       how often bad guys use scrambled phones. The real
                       threat is from their use of cellular clones which
                       makes tapping them as impossible as a scrambled phone
                       does. ga
<SARAH>                Well, say, in your career, how many times have you had
                       to do it? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Never.  ga
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     Ken, have you ever handled any cases of
                       harassment/obscene messaging on public BBs, or through
                       e-mail? Do you ever have to deal with "stalker" cases?
                       ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        I have recently had a case like that brought to my
                       attention. Frankly, it is not a fact pattern that I am
                       inclined to do much with. I view it more as a matter
                       internal to the bbs. I am more interested if the perp
                       used a stolen credit card to get the bbs account. Now
                       that's a real crime. ga
<SARAH>                Follow-up, Chuck?
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   Ken, what kind d of "intrusion" cases have you done?
                       ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        The most notable one is the outgrowth of the infamous
                       (grin) Pumpcon police action. I cannot go into too
                       much detail because charges are still pending.
                       But, I have one person under indictment for breaking
                       into a business computer and installing three user-ids
                       into the PASSWD file. Two were superusers. He is
                       charged with felony computer tampering and forgery.
                       ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Why only TWO superuser ids?
<SARAH>                (You might oughta define superuser.)
<[ken] GUEST-3>        One was set up as a regular id. ***(Prefer omission of
rest of this answer; or if you must proceed as edited)***Want to know why? Ask
                       the <intruder>. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      (A superuser can do anything they like to a system,
                       without exception.)
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Superuser means the computer thought he was god. ga
<SARAH>                This is the case I know as the Marriott Hotel Bust,
                       right? Thanks, Ross. ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Right. ga
<SARAH>                What about theft of phone service? Is it just mostly
                       kids cutting corners? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        That's how it starts. Unfortunately, it is a
                       multi-billion dollar business that has caused at least
                       one street murder in NYC in a battle over control of
                       phone booths. ga
<SARAH>                A murder?! ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Yeah, the dead man tried to run his own call sell
                       operation. That means he used stolen access codes and
                       sold calls to people in the street. Ten bucks for 20
                       minutes, anywhere in the world. His competitor wanted
                       to control all the illegal street phone use in the
                       neighborhood. It seems they could not reach an
                       amicable settlement. ga
<SARAH>                This is a pretty big business? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Estimates run from 1 to 6 billion dollars annually in
                       lost revenue. ga
<SARAH>                Ouch! The Mafia? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        If you mean the good ole La Cosa Nostra, I do not
                       know. If you mean organized crime: Yes! ga


***(Prefer omission of next q&a or use edited version)***


<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     My gosh! How do you become a "super-user"? (Especially
                       here on GEnie.) <g> How could you ever convince a
                       system to let you do ANYTHING you wanted, as if you
                       were the sysop? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        The <intruder> accessed the PASSWD file in an edit
                       mode, and simply typed in the superuser ids. ga
*****

<[ross] GREENBER>      Follow-up, Chuck?
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     Thanks. Is the average BB that easy to break
                       into/tamper with?
<[ken] GUEST-3>        This was not a bbs, but the business computer of a
                       retail store chain. It was very easy to break in to.
                       They had not removed any default passwords from the
                       initial login sequences. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Another, Chuck?
<SARAH>                Good grief!
<[ross] GREENBER>      Cy's up now. Go ahead, Cy
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   Ken, have you run into any cases involving Storm
                       Shadow (Morty Rosenfield) or Phiber Obtik (Mark
                       Abene). If so, what are your view of the cases? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        I have heard of these gentlemen, and met Phiber once.
                       But no allegations against them have been made to me.
                       ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Follow up, Cy?
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   As a follow up to your last comment, Ken... What is
                       your view about systems not getting rid of their
                       defaults or lowering their security. Shouldn't they be
                       held responsible for the "attacks" against them? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        NO! The law permits people to be sloppy, lazy, even
                       stupid. None of that excuses an unauthorized break-in.
                       You can leave your car with the door open,
                       the key in the ignition, and the motor running, and no
                       one can use it w/o your permission. Why should a
                       computer be different?. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Another, Cy?
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   But, if you park your car in a bad section of the
                       city, and even w/out "THECLUB" in better parts, you
                       are asking for trouble. GA
<[ken] GUEST-3>        I am not saying that sloppy security is bright, and it
                       is certainly true that LE looks askance at undue
                       stupidity, but those are practical questions .. of how
                       you treat a case, and separate from the question of
                       whether the intrusion was ok under the law. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Done, Cy?
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   Yes. Thanks. :) GA!
<[ross] GREENBER>      Dennis, You're on! LE-to-LE!
<[Dennis] D.MCCAULEY1> Ken, what's your assessment of the hacker threat these
                       days? Is it mischief or is it a true concern to
                       society? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Sounding like a true lawyer, it is both! (g) Most
                       teenage hacking is mischief, just like most other
                       teenage misconduct. However, I know teenagers who
                       are in the racket of stealing credit profiles from
                       TRW-type companies and selling them to organized crime
                       for illicit use. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Another, Dennis?
<[Dennis] D.MCCAULEY1> Well, I meant public concern in the sense of starting
                       World War III and that kind of thing.
                       Like Kevin Mitnick was said to be able to do. ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        No, that is pure media-hype BS! ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Done, Dennis? (I take it you LIKED Wargames?)
<[Dennis] D.MCCAULEY1> Well, I also wanted to ask Ken about porn on BBS's. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Go for it, then!
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Do you mean my favorite type <g>? ga
<[Dennis] D.MCCAULEY1> OK Ken - what about garden-variety dirty pix on BBS?
                       Seems to generate a lot of bad PR for the BBS world,
                       but most don't carry more than your average video
                       store. Not kiddie porn, of course, that's clearly
                       illegal. ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        The only problem has to do with the kids: can they get
                       at it? or are they in it?
                       Re the first issue, MOM and DAD are the best cops
                       there are. Re the second, that's just about the most
                       depraved bahavior there is. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Mitch, you're FINALLY up.
<[Mitch] MITCHWAGNER>  Okay, my question is whether computer crime really is
                       a big business. All the stuff we read about seems to
                       be penny-ante. Credit-card fraud for a couple of
                       thousand of dollars at most. Is anyone making big
                       money off of computer crime? This is something of a
                       follow-up to Dennis's question. -ga-
<[ken] GUEST-3>        I am not aware of any big capers that I do not
                       personally handle unless they get some publicity.
                       The biggest bucks have been stolen as far as I know,
                       not through intrusions, but by using the computer as
                       the burglar tool or record keeper for the crime. In
                       those types of cases, tens of millions have been
                       stolen. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Follow-up, Mitch?
<[Mitch] MITCHWAGNER>  How did that work? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Take your pick. Making up phony insurance policies to
                       lure investors into the Equity Funding swindle about
                       15 years ago was the first biggie.
                       There is also the story that VW Corp in Germany got
                       ripped off for many millions due a computer-directed
                       fund transfer. But I cannot vouch for that. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Done, Mitch?
<[Mitch] MITCHWAGNER>  Yup.
<[ross] GREENBER>      Jabba, the AmigaNut, is up.
<[AmigaNut] JABBA>     Ken, when you participated in drafting the computer
                       crime statutes, was there any significant opposition
                       to the legislation? [ga]
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Not to the idea of it, but there was a lot of fighting
                       about how they should be structured. The big problem
                       was whether teenage curiosity was to be outlawed or
                       not. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Follow-up, Jabba?
<[AmigaNut] JABBA>     Teenage curiosity? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Yeah, "hackers" breaking in just to look. The answer
                       was that it is illegal, but we trust the discretion of
                       LE to know when to prosecute or not, just like in
                       other crimes. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Another, Jabba?
<[AmigaNut] JABBA>     Ah. Does the statute contain confiscation provisions?
                       ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        No, not specifically. But if a computer is used to
                       commit a crime, it goes under the general idea that
                       the bad guy must forfeit the tools of his crime. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Does this fit under RICO?
<[AmigaNut] JABBA>     OK. Thanks.
<[ken] GUEST-3>        No. RICO is a federal statute that would not apply to
                       a single person committing intrusions. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Thanks. Mike, you're up!
<MIKE.C>               Jabba just touched on this, but as a follow-up... Do
                       you feel that there are adequate computer crime laws
                       on the books? If not, is this because of a lack of
                       understanding among legislators of how serious
                       computer crime can be? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        The laws in NY are okay, but could be tighter. For
                       example, there is no specific provision outlawing the
                       unauthorized insertion of a virus, and to prove
                       unauthorized use, LE has to show that the defendant
                       was warned to stay out of the system! The problem
                       is the ignorance of the legislature. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Mike, another question for Ken?
<MIKE.C>               Is a computer criminal prosecuted under the laws of
                       the state he/she lives in, or where the computer is
                       located? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Can be either or both. Just like shooting someone
                       across a state line. You can prosecute for murder in
                       either state. We can assert jurisdiction where the
                       actor was or where the penetrated computer was. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Follow-up on that, Mike?
<MIKE.C>               Do you think a strong national computer crime law
                       would be a good idea? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Sure, why not? But more important are well trained
                       cops and prosecutors at all levels, especially the
                       states. I hate to see the feds take over the field.
                       They tend to treat everything as a national
                       emergency. ga
<MIKE.C>               Thanks Ken, Ross!
<[ross] GREENBER>      Thanks for the questions, Mike. Cy's up!
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   Ken, what do you think of cases where a user on a BIG
                       system (national), knows the system to a large extent.
                       The user tells the Sysops of the systems of bugs and
                       problems he has found. Do you think this user deserves
                       thanks, or at least recognition or his finding?
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Is he an authorized user? ga
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   In my opinion, this kind of "hacker" is a asset. To
                       other people, such as those on a system, he is a
                       hacker. The user is authorized -- it is a public
                       system. ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        If he is authorized and does not exceed his
                       authorization, then thank him. If he in not
                       authorized or exceeds the level, that's like thanking
                       the burglar for pointing out your loose window. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Cy, another?
<[Cy TROic] F.GLYNN>   Nope. Thanks!
<[ross] GREENBER>      Okey doke. Chuck, you're on stage!
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     Ken, do you know if other countries have national
                       computer crime laws? How do other nations deal with
                       computer crime? Especially European nations. ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Most European nations, at least western, do have them.
                       I do not know the details, however.ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      I know that the UK has VERY strong laws against
                       Computer Misuse! Chuck, another?
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     Do you know of any international statutes concerning
                       computer crimes? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        I have not heard of any international provisions of
                       any sort. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Chuck, another question for Ken?
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     That's all for now.
<[ross] GREENBER>      Thanks, Chuck. Sarah? You're up!
<SARAH>                Backing up to computer porn, if someone handed you a
                       case where a kid (say 19) with a local BBS had a
                       closed directory for x-rated files, but a couple of
                       x-rated files were found in an open directory, what
                       would you do? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Didn't this just happen somewhere near Cleveland?...
<SARAH>                I think so, but I don't remember the name.
<[ken] GUEST-3>        If the availability of the porn was accidental, then
                       so what, IMHO. ga
<SARAH>                How would the kid prove it was accidental? ga
<[ken] GUEST-3>        By showing the protections he normally has in place.
                       ga
<SARAH>                Ah, I see. Thanks. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Ken: if a person unknowingly spreads a virus, are they
                       criminally negligent?
<[ken] GUEST-3>        No, not if they do so knowingly. That's intentional.ga
                       Sorry, I misread your question....
                       If they did so unknowingly, they they are not guilty
                       of anything. Even criminal negligence requires a
                       grossly sloppy and negligent behavior. Simple not
                       knowing cannot convict you of anything. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Sarah advises me that cops like to get up early and go
                       to bed early. This being Ken's first RTC (but
                       hopefully not his last), let's wrap up. Any last
                       questions?
<[ross] GREENBER>      Okey doke. Last question for the evening. Chuck, you
                       have the honors!
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE      Would you prosecute someone who spread a harmless
                       virus, one that simply flashed a message at a given
                       time, or would you just "slap his wrist"? I mean,
                       would you NOT slap his wrist.
<[ken] GUEST-3>        If the virus is harmless, but it did intrude without
                       any authorization, then some low level LE attention is
                       warranted. How low level would depend on the details
                       of the behavior and the extent of the spread. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Chuck, last question?
<[Chuck] C.LEPAGE>     That's it. Thank you, Ken.
<SARAH>                Ken, thanks so much for coming. This has been a really
                       informative RTC. Can we ask you again some other time?
<[ken] GUEST-3>        Sure, be delighted. ga
<SARAH>                Then we'll say good night and let you get some sleep.
                       :)
<[ross] GREENBER>      Ken, my thanks, too. I have a feeling that only about
                       10% of the questions people wanted to ask got asked.
                       So you'll be back sooner than you thought!
<[ken] GUEST-3>        OK, good night to all, and thanks for the opportunity
                       to RTC with you. I think this sort of dialogue is
                       VIP. ga
<[ross] GREENBER>      Good night, Ken!
<SARAH>                'Night, Ken. :)
<[ross] GREENBER>      And, for those in the audience and for the
                       question-askers: thanks for being here and for asking
                       the questions!

Subject: File 2--CPSR Workplace Privacy Test

                   CPSR Workplace Privacy Testimony
        =====================================================

                          Prepared Testimony
                                 and
                       Statement for the Record
                                  of
                           Marc Rotenberg,
                  Director, CPSR Washington office,
         Adjunct Professor, Georgetown University Law Center
                                  on
                              H.R. 1900,
              The Privacy for Consumers and Workers Act

                                Before
           The Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations,
                  Committee on Education and Labor,
             U.S. House of Representatives June 30, 1993

	Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, thank for the opportunity
to testify today on H.R. 1900, the Privacy for Consumers and Workers
Act.  My name is Marc Rotenberg and I am the director of the CPSR
Washington office and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University
Law Center where I teach a course on information privacy law.

	Speaking on behalf of CPSR, we strongly endorse the Privacy for
Consumers and Workers Act.  The measure will establish important
safeguards for workers and consumers in the United States.  We believe
that H.R. 1900 is particularly important as our country becomes more
dependent on computerized information systems and the risk of privacy
abuse increases.

	CPSR has a special interest in workplace privacy.  For almost a
decade we have advocated for the design of computer systems that
better serve the needs of employees in the workplace.  We do not view
this particular goal as a trade-off between labor and management.  It
is our belief that computer systems and information policies that are
designed so as to value employees will lead to a more productive work
environment and ultimately more successful companies and
organizations.  As Charles Hecksher of the Harvard Business School has
said good managers have no use for secret monitoring.

	Equally important is the need to ensure that certain fundamental
rights of employees are safeguarded.  The protection of personal
privacy in the information age may be as crucial for American workers
as the protection of safety was in the age of machines.  Organizations
that fail to develop appropriate workplace privacy policies leave
employees at risk of abuse, embarrassment, and harassment.

	The concern about workplace privacy is widely felt in the computer
profession.  This month MacWorld magazine, a leading publication in
the computer industry, released a special report on workplace privacy.
The report, based on a survey of 301 companies in the United States
and authored by noted science writer Charles Piller, made clear the
need for a strong federal policy.

	Among the key findings of the MacWorld survey:

>  More than 21 percent of those polled said that they had
"engaged in searches of employee computer files, voice mail,
electronic mail, or other networking communications."

>  "Monitoring work flow" is the most frequently cited reason for
electronic searches.

>  In two out of three cases, employees are not warned about
electronic searches.

>  Only one third of the companies surveyed have a written policy on
privacy

	What is also interesting about the MacWorld survey is the high level
of concern expressed by top corporate managers about electronic
monitoring.  More than a half of those polled said that electronic
monitoring was either "never acceptable" or "usually or always
counterproductive."  Less than five percent believed that electronic
monitoring was a good tool to routinely verify honesty.

	These numbers suggest that managers would support a sensible privacy
law.  Indeed, they are consistent with other privacy polls conducted
by Professor Alan Westin for the Lou Harris organization which show
that managers are well aware of privacy concerns and may, with a
little prodding, agree to sensible policies.

	What would such a policy look like?  The MacWorld report also
includes a model privacy policy that is based on several U.S. and
international privacy codes.  Here are the key elements:

>  Employees should know what electronic surveillance tools are used,
and how management will use the data gathered.

>  Management should minimize electronic monitoring as much as
possible.  Continuous monitoring should not be permitted.

>  Data should only be used for clearly defined, work-related
purposes.

>  Management should not engage in secret monitoring unless there is
credible evidence of criminal activity or serious wrongdoing.

>  Data gathered through monitoring should not be the sole factor in
employee evaluations.

>  Personal information gathered by employers should not be disclosed
to any third parties, except to comply with legal requirements.

>  Employees or prospective employees should not be asked to waive
privacy rights.

>  Managers who violate these privacy principles should be subject to
discipline or termination.

	Many of these provisions are contained in H.R. 1900, the Privacy for
Consumers and Workers Act.  Clearly, the policies and the bill itself
are not intended to prohibit monitoring, nor to prevent employers from
protecting their business interests.  What the bill will do is help
establish a clear framework that ensures employees are properly
notified of monitoring practices, that personal information is not
misused, and that monitoring capability is not abused.  It is a
straightforward, sensible approach that does not so much balance
rights as it clarifies interests and ensures that both employers and
employees will respect appropriate limitations on monitoring
capability.

	The need to move quickly to establish a framework for workplace
privacy protection is clear.  Privacy problems will become more acute
in the years ahead as new monitoring schemes are developed and new
forms of personal data are collected.  As Professor Gary Marx has made
clear, there is little that can be imagined in the monitoring realm
that can not be achieved.  Already, some members of the computer
profession are wearing "active badges" that provide full-time
geographical monitoring.  Properly used, these devices help employees
use new tools in the hi-tech workplace.  Improperly used, such devices
could track the physical movements of an employee throughout the day,
almost like a blip on a radar screen.

	Computers are certainly powerful tools.  We believe that they can be
used to improve productivity and increase job satisfaction.  But this
requires that appropriate policies be developed to address employee
concerns and that laws be passed, when necessary, to ensure that
computer abuse does not occur.

	This concludes my testimony.  I would be pleased to answer your
questions.

About the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in July, 1990 to ensure
freedom of expression in digital media, with a particular emphasis on
applying the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
to computer-based communication. EFF has rapidly evolved into one of the
leading organizations that individuals, corporations, the media, and
government turn to when considering questions involving new communications
technology.

EFF's mission is to foster the opportunities of digital communication for
individuals and communities in a free and open society. The Foundation:

o       Shapes the national policy debate on how the communications
infrastructure will develop, and how electronic communications will be
regulated;

o       Facilitates discussion and organizes action around technology
policy issues of interest to a wide range of groups and individuals, such
as digital privacy and cryptography, the future of the Internet; etc. and

o       Seeks and undertakes cases to defend the civil liberties of
individuals and organizations using computers and communication technology,
and provides informal legal services to net users;

o       Engages in outreach and educational activities within the community
of electronic network users as well as among law enforcement officials,
policy makers, corporations and others.

EFF also creates forums, publications and information resources, available
in print and on a number of electronic networks, to raise awareness of
political, legal, social and cultural issues that result from the
widespread use of electronic communication. Over the next few years, EFF
will continue its work in the civil liberties, policy, and public education
arenas, while sponsoring research projects and events that explore the
nature of communities in Cyberspace, and support their evolution here and
abroad.

In the next two years, EFF expects to broaden its presence on a range of
electronic networks, expand its membership; experiment with organizing and
fundraising campaigns conducted on electronic networks; add new members to
its Board; and improve its communication program encompassing media
relations, public speaking engagements for staff and Board members, the
development of a number of online forums, and regular production of
electronic and printed publications. EFF currently has 7 full time
professional staff and two support staff. The staff size is expected to
double over the next year to accommodate the anticipated growth of EFF's
programs and operations.

EFF receives funding from a variety of sources, including corporations,
individual donors, and other foundations. EFF also receives membership fees
from several hundred individual and corporate members, which entitles them
to publications and online access to discussions and seminars on the
Internet.

((MODERATORS' NOTE: About one-third of CuD readers obtain CuD from
local BBSes. We receive a few calls or letters each week from readers
wondering if there are BBSes in their area that carry CuD, but we
haven't kept formal list of boards that maintain up-to-date archives.
There are so many, we can't maintain systematic records. But, we'll
periodically publish a list of BBSes around the world that do. If your
board does, let us know. Send a summary of the board and other
information (in a brief paragraph or two) and every few months we will
list them. Here's another board that maintains complete CuD files)).
