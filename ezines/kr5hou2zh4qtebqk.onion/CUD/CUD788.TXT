Subject: File 1--CORRECTION in CuD SUB/UNSUB Policy (address change)

In a previous message we printed the wrong address for subs
and unsubs to CuD. Here is the corrected version:

                 CHANGES IN CuD SUBSCRIPTION POLICY:

Sadly, the size of the CuD mailing list has become to large to
manage manually. Therefore, after November 5, we WILL NO LONGER
ACCEPT MANUAL SUBS.
So, please DO NOT SEND sub requests to the moderators. Instead:

To SUBSCRIBE to CuD, send this message:

      sub cudigest   firstname   lastname

(where "firstname" and "lastname" is YOUR first and last name)

Send this message to:   listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu

We strongly encourage readers to obtain CuD from USENET as
comp.society.cu-digest. Or, obtain it from any of the CuD web or ftp
sites (the CuD homepage is:
      http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest

To UNSUB from CuD, send this message:    unsub  cudigest
to:   listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu

The UIUC listserv will change addresses in January, '96, so
we will notify readers when the change occurs.

We apologize for any inconvenience this causes, but we're simply
unable to keep up with the demands.

             Security, Electronic Commerce, and the Internet:
                            Impact on Industry

                      CWRU & ISSA North Coast Chapter
               International Computer Security Day Symposium
                        Thursday, November 30, 1995
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Companies  can  no  longer  overlook  the  role  that  electronic
commerce will play in their business.  Those with systems on  the
Internet must think about how to protect what they put up.

On  Thursday, November 30, 1995, Case Western Reserve  University
and  the  North Coast Chapter of the Information Systems Security
Association will be observing International Computer Security Day
with  a  unique  symposium designed to help  you  understand  the
electronic marketplace.

Whether your goals include enhancing customer service, increasing
marketing effectiveness, or promoting products and services,  you
will  want  to join us as we explore the Internet as an  emerging
force on industry.

"If you think that technology will suddenly make the world more
secure, you're wrong."  (Tim Berners-Lee, Director, W3 Consortium)

               International Computer Security Day Symposium
                        Thursday, November 30, 1995
             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


This symposium will bring together industry leaders and technology
revolutionaries who will share their vision of the maturation of
the Internet as a tool for commerce; and it will teach you how to
participate in this revolution in a rational, professional, and
secure way.  Our speakers include:

Dr. Vijay Ahuja, Product Manager, Network Security Products
    IBM (Research Triangle Park, NC)
Dr. Frederick B. Cohen, Ph.D., President
    Management Analytics (Hudson, OH)
Mr. John Gage, Director, Science Office
    Sun Microsystems Computer Corp. (Mountain View, CA)
Dr. Erik Grimmelmann, Marketing Vice President, Gateway Services
    AT&T
Mr. Leo A. McCloskey, networkMCI Consulting Group
    MCI Telecommunications Corporation (Pittsburgh, PA)
Mr. Daniel E. White, Partner, IS Security Effectiveness Series
    Ernst & Young LLP (Chicago, IL)

Objective:  Today's Internet is a business tool that lets
            information cross geographical and functional
            boundaries.  Everyone is talking about it, you've
            read about it in the newspapers, and you've watched
            it on television news programs.  You want to
            establish a business presence on the Internet, you
            want to take advantage of this capability, and you
            want to use the Internet for electronic commerce;
            but you're concerned about your exposure.  After
            all, everyone from The New York Times to The Los
            Angeles Times has told you that flaws in network
            technologies threaten the security of commercial
            transactions over the global Internet.  What do you
            do?

Who:        This symposium is designed for corporate
            strategists, policy makers, marketing executives,
            and information technology professionals (including
            technology planners, communications and network
            managers, information security managers, and
            technology auditors).  Others interested in the
            worldwide adoption of the Internet for commercial
            use are also invited to attend.

When:       Thursday, November 30, 1995, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.

Where:      Thwing Center, Case Western Reserve University,
            11111 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio.

Lunch:      Grand Foyer, Severance Hall, 11001 Euclid Avenue,
            Cleveland, Ohio.

Lunch Panel:     Network Security:  Do You Know Who's Breaking in
                 Right Now?

            Polls, newspaper articles, and professionals have
            all suggested that the primary concern of Internet
            users world wide is the potential for unauthorized
            access to their potential or proprietary
            information.  This issue threatens to slow or limit
            the worldwide adoption of the Internet for
            commercial use.  The lack of security touches all
            of those who are concerned about copyright,
            individual privacy, and personal freedom.  What
            progress has been made?  Is this a solvable
            problem?  Do Internet users have to sacrifice their
            open, freewheeling culture in order to provide
            necessary security for the Net?  Does this
            commercialization work in the current architecture
            of the Internet?  Do we have a choice?  These are
            the questions our moderator will pose to our
            distinguished group of industry and technology
            leaders, each of whom has a large stake in the
            outcome of this debate.  This should be a fiery
            discussion!

Hello!

Frontier Technologies will be releasing this information on Business
Wire first thing Monday morning, Oct.30.  However, both Ann and I
wanted you to have heads-up on this information.  We will be
demonstrating this new technology at Internetworld in Boston, Oct. 30 -
Nov. 1 (booth # 564).  If you are interested, and you would like an
interview, feel free to contact either one of us to arrange a time.

Frontier Technologies Leads The Pack In Supporting New Internet Graphic
& Sound Compression Technology
Johnson-Grace's High speed publishing technology to be integrated into
Frontier's Internet Browser

MEQUON, WI -- October 30, 1995 -- Frontier Technologies Corporation, an
industry leader in Internet technology, and Johnson-Grace Company
announced that Frontier Technologies' award-winning Internet browser
now supports Johnson-Grace's ART 2.0 (TM) file compression technology.

ART technology compresses graphic images and sound into one file,
allowing users to rapidly download files over even slow Internet
connections, and simultaneously display graphics and play back sound as
the file downloads.  Users of Frontier's ART-enabled Internet browser
will be able to download sound and graphic files three times faster
than with ordinary browsers and will be able to simultaneously hear
broadcast-quality sound.  For example, a 24KB .BMP file and a 335KB
.WAV file can compress into a 14KB .ART file.

A beta version of Frontier's new ART-enabled Internet browser is
available for immediate download from http://www.frontiertech.com.
Frontier has also set up an "ART Gallery" on its web site, including
several ART files.  The ART Gallery provides links to several other
Internet sites containing ART files, including the electronic Gourmet
Guide, iGOLF, and LAN Magazine.  Web page designers wishing to embed
ART files in their own HTML documents can download Johnson-Grace's ART
Press (TM) authoring tool from both the Frontier and Johnson-Grace web
sites.

Internet users wishing to experience the new ART Technology may access
several World Wide Web sites after downloading Frontier's new Internet
browser.  The electronic Gourmet Guide, Inc. ("the eGG")
(http://www.2way.com/food/egg) iGOLF (http://wwwigolf.com), and LAN
Magazine (http://www.lanmag.com)are among the first World Wide Web
sites to provide ART images and sound.

Subject: File 5--Riddler is looking for home pages...


 On Friday 8/18/95, Interactive Imaginations launched a completely
 new version of Riddler.  The game, now called Quibbler, is a free
 contest that gives people on the Web the opportunity to win cash
 prizes by solving a variety of riddles and puzzles.  The game is
 accessible via www.riddler.com.

 We are looking for home pages to hide some of the clues that are
 needed to solve the riddles, and believe your page would be ideal.
 Your site will be seamlessly integrated into a specific game.  For
 example, if we were to hide a clue on the Stephen King home page,
 contestants would get a hint leading them to that page.  To facilitate
 the player's search, Infoseek and Yahoo will be incorporated locally
 on our site.

 Upon figuring out that the page in question was the Stephen King
 page, contestants would locate that page on the Web and find one of
 four clues needed to solve the main riddle.

 Since your participation is also free, the benefits of your
 participation are tremendous.  Since a link to our game can be
 maintained for a duration, you will have the opportunity to promote
 the subject of your page to all participants of our game.  In
 addition, you will have an opportunity to participate in the up and
 coming Riddler Network events such as the much-anticipated Riddler's
 Choice 10K race around the web.  Remember, there is absolutely no cost
 to you or the players.

 If you are interested in participating in an upcoming game or have
 questions or want more information about the game, please respond to
 davet@riddler.com.

 In your response e-mail please include the following information for
 scheduling purposes:

 **********************************************************************

 URL of your Home Page to be used:

 Name of page:

 Contact Name:

 Company Name (if any):

 Work Phone #:  (for scheduling /emergencies)

 Home Phone #:  (for scheduling /emergencies)

 E-mail Address:

 Your State or Country: (so I know the time zone differences)

 What key words can one use to search for your site, along with the
 search engine to be used.  For example: Riddler Network- yahoo,
 Interactive Games - Infoseek.

 When is the best time to reach you? (very important)

 Do you have other pages with direct links through search engines?
 If so, please provide the URL's and keywords which would locate them
 directly via a search engine.

 **********************************************************************

 Again, if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to
 contact me.

 Looking forward to your participation,

Thought this article might interest you, since it seems to be an answer to
having the cybergardians breathing down ones neck. Since it's not my
article, you probably have to get permission to publish from the Internet

JUMPING THE GUN ON SYSOP LIABILITY
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+

[This is the third of a series of articles discussing recommendations made in
the report issued September 5, 1995 by President Clinton's Information
Infrastructure Task Force. The report is entitled "Intellectual Property and
the National Information Infrastructure (NII)," and is commonly referred to
as the White Paper.]

The White Paper makes various recommendations for legislative changes which
it hopes will grease the onramps to the Information Highway. Besides these
overt recommendations, the White Paper also expends considerable effort to
analyze the current state of the law.

This analysis of the current state of the law, though presented as objective,
often represents the Administration's desired interpretation of legal issues
that are as yet unsettled in the courts. In presenting this analysis, the
Administration hopes that its interpretations will be adopted by the courts,
and affect the outcomes of some cases currently pending.

One area where the White Paper's analysis rises to the level of
"recommendation" relates to whether a sysop or online provider should be held
liable for unknowingly facilitating the distribution of materials that
infringe someone's copyright. This infringment occurs when users of the
system upload and download material without permission from the copyright
holder.

Where such infringement is occurring, the online operator, theoretically,
could be found liable for direct infringement, vicarious infringement, or
contributory infringement. Or, the online operator could also be found not
liable at all.

Direct infringement is where the defendant directly causes the infringement
to occur. The court in Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Frena found the BBS
operator to be directly liable for the display and distribution of Playboy
photographs, which were uploaded and downloaded by subscribers, without the
knowledge of the operator. If direct infringement is found, then there is
strict liability. That means that there will be liability even where the
"infringer-operator" had no knowledge that the infringement was occurring.

Vicarious infringement would occur where  someone has the "right and ability"
to supervise the infringing action of another, even though the supervisor has
no knowledge of the infringement. Accordingly, an operator could be found to
be vicariously liable if a court determines that it has the right and ability
to supervise the activities of the users.

Contributory infringement may be found when one who, with knowledge of the
infringing activity, contributes to the infringing conduct of another.  An
online operator could be found to be a contributory infringer based on the
provision of online services and equipment facilitating the direct
infringement of the users.

Although the Playboy case found the operator to be directly liable for the
infringement, the type of liability, or whether there would even be
liability, is currently an unsettled and unclear issue. However, the White
Paper gives the impression that this issue is settled and that operators will
be directly infringing when subscribers upload and download copyrighted
material without their knowledge. The White Paper states affirmatively that
"[a]ltering the standards of liability for infringement [for online
operators] would be a significant departure from current copyright principles
and law and would result in a substantial derogation of the right of
copyright owners."

Taking the position that operators will be held to be direct infringers, the
White Paper dismisses the following arguments in favor holding operators to a
different standard than others:   (1) the volume of material on a service
provider's system is too large to monitor or screen; (2) even if a service
provider is willing and able to monitor the material on its system, it cannot
always identify infringing material; (3) failure to shield online service
providers will impair communication and availability of information; (4)
exposure to liability for infringement will drive service providers out of
business, causing the NII to fail; and (5) the law should impose liability
only on those who assume responsibility for the activities their subscribers
engage in on their system, and not on operators who allow the system to
operate without content supervision.

The position that the White Paper promotes, that operators should be strictly
liable as direct infringers for the uploading and downloading of copyrighted
material, as mentioned, is currently unsettled. By assuming this position,
the Administration has been viewed as seeking to influence the following
currently pending cases to adopt this position.  In one (Sega Enterprises
Ltd. v. MAPHIA), the court issued a preliminary injunction against a BBS for
allowing and facilitating the unauthorized uploading of Sega's copyrighted
video games. In a second case (Frank Music Corp. v. CompuServe), CompuServe
is being sued for allegedly allowing the unauthorized uploading and
downloading of musical recordings. In third case (Religious Technology Center
v. NETCOM), the Church of Scientology is suing a BBS operator and an Internet
access provide for allowing the unauthorized uploading of copyrighted
materials.

In situations where an operator is truly innocent regarding infringement
resulting from the uploading and downloading of copyrighted material, law
makers have to determine who should bear the responsibility for and loss of
this infringement: the copyright holders, the online operators or the users
committing the infringement.  The position that the White Paper promotes
sides with the copyright holder in the sense that it places the burden on
those other than the copyright holder to expend time and effort to protect
the copyright holder's interests.
