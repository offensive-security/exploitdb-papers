   Cyber Angels' Antiporn Database Dies
   by Janelle Brown

   2:57pm  14.Mar.97.PST The Internet is chock-full of sexual
   predators, pedophiles, and free hard-core porn, and according
   to the Cyber Angels, not enough is being done about it. Thus,
   the self-described "Internet safety organization" spent six
   months developing the FACES project, a database of information
   to help identify children who might be suffering sexual abuse.
   But the recent demise of the ambitious project, which would
   have included cropped pictures of children believed to be
   victims of porn, highlights serious concerns about netizens
   taking matters into their own hands.

  ..................

   The database project, which would have been publicly
   accessible, had become entangled in moral and legal issues.
   "Although we were able to build a small database of faces,
   most child porn available is unsuitable for the project," says
   [Colin "Gabriel" ] Hatcher.  "The children are in distress so
   you can't get a straight face from it, or the pictures are too
   old - they are from the 1970s and the kids are adults now."

  ..................

   While Hatcher says that the issues brought up in the Cu Digest
   debate were ones that the Cyber Angels were aware of, the
   anger that surrounded news of the project highlights netizen
   concerns about citizen-organized Net-policing. The CyberAngels
   say they are simply trying to help federal authorities by
   pointing out "probable cause," but some feel that an
   organization of thousands citizens out to patrol the Net with
   quasi-cop intentions is troublesome. It is the same criticism
   some have of the Guardian Angels patrolling city streets for
   crime.

  ...........................

   With the dissolution of the project, the Cyber Angels will
   refocus their attention on education issues, aiding netizens
   who need help, and continuing to patrol Usenet to prevent
   trouble. With over 200 requests for help coming in each week,
   they've got plenty to keep them busy - as well as the
   continuing public debate about whether they are qualified to
   do what they are doing.

Japanese Internet Users May Need Magician

By Russell Blinch

TOKYO - "What is a wizard?"

It was a question asked by Aya Ishihara, general manager of a Japanese
Internet
service provider run by SSK & RCY Corp., during a recent conversation.

Microsoft and other companies have recently introduced "Wizards" --
programs that,
seemingly with the powers of a magician, can help frustrated personal
computer users
load programs and undertake other tasks.

While the 29-year-old Ishihara had an inkling of what the Wizard metaphor
was all
about, her question illustrated why the Japanese are having trouble signing
on to the
Internet.

So, like, wow, they don't know how to surf over to Yahoo on their browsers
and hot link
to some really cool homepage?

"Many Japanese are against these kinds of terms," Ishihara said.

It may seem ironic that a country that has flabbergasted the world with so
many
electronic innovations would be trailing other countries when it comes to
the Internet.

But many Japanese Internet players believe their country is badly trailing
the United
States, Canada and even Europe.

"Compared with the U.S., it's really behind -- maybe three years," said
Masahiro Inoue,
president of Yahoo Japan.

Internet idiom was a challenge for just about all users when they first
took their baby
steps on the World Wide Web. It could be argued, however, that North Americans
familiar enough with the surf -- or snow -- boarding culture probably had a
leg up when it
came to adapting to the Web culture.

According to the Japan Economic Almanac, there are one million Japanese Web
surfers, which is absurdly low for a highly-industrialized country of 125
million.

Even Canada, with a population of 30 million, has been estimated to have a Web
surfing populace of more than double that.

Another barrier to the Internet looming as large as Mount Fuji is the high
cost of Web
surfing in Japan.

The Japanese do not have the luxury of a flat rate system for local phone
charges, as
surfers enjoy in North America. Instead they must pay a charge per three
minutes on a
local call. So when an Internet charge is factored in along with local
tolls, the cost of
fairly moderate surfing can run skyward.

An official at the Canadian embassy in Tokyo explained that it was easy to
incur a
charge of more than 12,000 yen ($100) a month for Internet use -- which is
about three
to four times what a North American might pay for access.

Nevertheless, a number of Japanese players don't believe they can afford to
move to
flat rate pricing, because it might lead to other problems. They seem well
educated in
the woes America Online has been facing with congested access to their
network.

"Maybe flat rate will lead to a chaotic solution," mused Ishihara, who at
the same time
saw the need for lower fees.

There are many signs, however, that the pace of Net development is about to
speed up
significantly here.

A number of Japanese players in the Web community liken the situation to
the use of
wireless phones.

Initially, the West was far ahead in the head count of street corner phone
yakkers, but
now it looks like the Japanese have taken a collective decision that
miniature, wireless
phones are indispensable tools for the urban dweller.

The phones really took off in 1995 with the introduction of the Personal
Handy Phone
system (PHS) and a pricing structure that many realized was too good to
pass up in
Japan's highly regulated communications system.

Many online players believe the Internet might be ready for a similar
explosion in
demand.

Officials at Fujitsu Ltd. and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone believe that
there are
probably more than five million Japanese Netizens when the number of people
are
counted that log on from the office.

People are using the Net at lunchtime, perhaps largely because it is still
too expensive
for many Japanese to maintain accounts from home.

Many Japanese Internet players are very optimistic that use of the Internet
in the office
will grow and spread to the home. And it would be this kind of growth that
might spur a
kind of collective wisdom or even "wizardry" from Japan -- as we have seen
many times
in the past from this country -- that will result in innovation benefiting
not only Japan but
the entire Internet community.

Subject: File 6--Re - Maryland online "harassment" bill

I was dismayed to read that this bill is being thought of as
censorship -- it is not.  What Mr. Jackson failed to mention in
his article is that I testifed ON BEHALF of House Bill 778.  Yes,
some of the words are not applicable and will probably be struck
from the final bill if it is passed, but I feel strongly that
online harassers MUST be punished.  All you have to do is go to
the web site in my signature below to see what I've been through
and I had no one I could contact for help.  The local police
couldn't help me, the FBI couldn't -- no one.  So this bill WILL
help victims of online harassment, even if it means starting with
those who harass via e-mail.  I intend on seeing this kind of
statute pass, not only in Maryland, but nationwide if I have to.

Background Fact Sheet on the Raid on 700 Commercial Ave, Coos Bay, Oregon on
4/6/96 @ 0800am

The Issues:

Where is the line drawn between a legally issued (though flawed) physical
search warrant for a single individual's computer files and/or
non-electronic evidence when it is executed in an computer-networked
multi-residential building.

A Synopsis:

A contingent of local Coos Bay, Oregon and State Police, in search of
evidence in an alleged computer crime during December 1996 against Koala
Computers of  Coos Bay, executed a search warrant at 700 Commercial Avenue
in Coos Bay on 06Mar97.

The search warrant (copies available on request) served by Oregon State
Police Detective  In Charge, Randy Becker, initiated a total building search
lasting eight and one half hours, including the private residences of the
twenty people living there, even though the warrant lists only one resident,
Dan Parker, as a suspect in the alleged crime and is addressed only to Mr.
Parker.

The four story ex-hospital houses a hi-tech community and staff for a
future, not-for-profit, cultural center and is slated to be the new home for
the CyberCat Cafe, a computer coffee house recently forced to vacate its
previous locale due to a notice to vacate their prior location without a
written cause.  Additional technologically-based businesses have applied to
lease space to operate from the location once zoning issues are settled with
city officials.

The in-house computer network in question was installed in late February
1997 and provides Internet connectivity to the residents as well as access
to a shared printer.  It does not provide file server functionality which is
the  the ability to share files between computers.  Mr. Parker was attached
to the network for a total of three days prior to the raid.

Although Mr. Parker neither owned nor had access to the other computers on
the network, inhabitants were detained in their residences until they were
removed during the search, which entailed the copying of hard drives and
other storage media as well as a physical search of the individual premises.

Vacant rooms in the building where the network does not extend and which
contain no computers were also searched. No residents were allowed to
witness the search of their living quarters or property. Additionally, one
corporate entity in the building, after threatening legal action subsequent
to a physical search, had their computers left untouched.

Floor plans detailing the commercial and residential space were submitted to
Coos Bay city officials as part of a zoning review three weeks prior to the
raid.  The same plans, which provide both the inhabitant's name and their
location within the building have been available on a web page since early
January 1997.

Additional Background:  CyberCat Cafe

Owner: Andrea Wasson
      700 Commercial Avenue
      Coos Bay, Oregon xxxxxx
      (541) 269-7491
      e-mail:  admin@cybrcat.com

Business:  The CyberCat Habitat , an Internet Coffee House  (currently
closed) struggling through zoning issues to reopen in a new location in Coos
Bay, Oregon as the only all ages business that offers indoor activities to
area teens and their families, in a well supervised, drug and alcohol-free
environment).

History:  Opened April 1996 at 184 Market Avenue in Coos Bay, Oregon,
offering computer access, espresso, coffee, soft drinks, juices, and
prepackaged snacks, plus acoustical entertainment on Friday/Saturday
evenings, and Saturday afternoons.  Customer base highly varied,
including teens, college age, siblings, parents, senior citizens.  In other
words, people of various racial, ethnic, sexual orientation, physical
abilities, and economic backgrounds within the community.  The CyberCat was
immediately discovered by area youth and was busy from its inception.

 Pressure is applied by several area police officers within
a couple months of opening for Ms. Wasson, as a business owner, to assume
responsibility for  controlling the actions or suspected actions of any and
all teens in the general area of the business, regardless of their
participation or lack of participation in the business as customers. Several
initiatives by Ms. Wasson for a joint effort between the CyberCat and
members of City Hall to find a solution for this problem are politely but
bureaucratically ignored prior to receiving a notice to vacate and being
forced to close the doors in October 1996.

Several police "encounters"  with both  younger customers and  the owner of
the business, lead to a filing a complaint with the city of harassment
against the police department after these encounters directly or indirectly
provoked the notice to vacate from the landlord at  that location.  The
building manager refused an actual written reason for the lease termination
but implied that the interest in CyberCat activities by the Coos Bay Police
Department (CBPD)  was a determining factor.

An internal investigation of the complaint found that neither CyberCat,
certain customers, nor the CBPD was guilty of any wrong doing and that all
of us were "mere victims of different people's perceptions".  Statements making
reference to interviews done during that investigation proved to be less
than truthful, as many who were listed as interviewed in the process of that
investigation claim they were never approached for interviews.  Letters of
support bearing witness to the harassment events which were sent to city
hall during the investigation were ignored.

Following the CyberCat's closing, Ms. Wasson and several volunteering
residents set out to renovate a large, unproductive building located at 700
Commercial Avenue to create a not-for-profit,  cultural activity center for
area youth, a project directly motivated by experiences encountered through
interaction with area youth at the coffeehouse.

The volunteers range in age from 18-67, and number at thirteen adults and
three children.  Additionally, four people related to the current building
owners with whom Ms. Wasson is negotiating the sale, also reside within the
building.

Each person/ or family has independent living quarters within the building,
clearly defined in their mailing addresses and on a floor map posted on the
Internet on a public access page which until the first week in March 1997,
also outlined the group's intentions for the building.  This page is being
updated after receipt of a notice of zoning issues was received from the
city regarding the need for a conditional use permit in order to reopen the
coffeehouse here.  However,  the basic information remains up on the web.

Additional Background:  The Raid

Pertinent questions are:

If this warrant was to secure evidence against one person, why were the
rights , personal property and/or computer files of 19 other people in the
building impacted and in my opinion, their civil rights violated?

Why did the warrant offer no definition of the crimes suspected and more
specific information of the evidence that was sought clearly outlined?

This "investigation" had been ongoing for over 2 months according to State
Police Press releases, why were no female officers dispatched when it was
known that women would be included in the raid?

Why was a generic search warrant issued against a whole building when
separate living quarters were well defined in a publicly accessible forum,
in the possession of city officials and also explained first hand to the
officers on the scene?

Why were people within the building refused the right to basic privacy to
get dressed when ordered from their beds, forced to be publicly humiliated
while dressing in front of officers on the scene? If all residents were to
be impacted by the warrant, why were ALL residents not included and given
copies of the warrant?

Where does the 4th amendment rights regarding search and seizure stop in
regards to a network connection to the Internet when no file sharing
capabilities are built into that system?


Additional Background:  Dan Parker

 It is interesting to note that there is a current conflict in process
between Dan and Koala Computers, his prior employer and the company filing
the charges of unauthorized access of a system against him.

All of his personal files which were maintained on an in-house terminal at
the business (which they claim were deleted through remote access in
December 1996) were in fact deleted prior to his leaving their employment.

Dan has been seeking payment from them for software programs he developed
for them under a separate contract since his employment was terminated and a
letter demanding payment for these programs was issued to them via
registered mail approximately one month ago after several personal contacts
demanding
payment failed.  He has been aggressively seeking resolution via legal channels
regarding this dispute.

      have the impression it will help users such like us to filter
      this junk away.

      The main problem with spam is that unless it titles some
      well-known Subject--(uppercase, $ signs, "money", "read this",
      etc...) or emanates from a notorious spamming domain, it is
      impossible to filter it automatically. And while it only takes a
      second to read and hit "delete", it's still both money and time
      wasted.

      Now, the spam king (no capital) is saying all the spams will
      come from one same domain : his. Great ! On an individual basis,
      it will allow us to tune our filter software more accurately. On
      a broader basis (a whole domain, or an ISP), I am persuaded that
      sysadmins will be easily convinced to completely block receipts
      of mails from this (these) domain, avoiding users to pay for
      junk mail since it will never reach their mailbox.

      Now, there is a real threat behind all this, though : if the
      spam king realizes this, and decides to change regularly the
      domain from which spams are issued. Registering a new domain name
      say, each week, is a no-cost for a successful company, and I'm
      afraid he *will* be successful... Sigh.

(As long as I'm replying, I'd like to mention that I seem to have
accidentally deleted (including in the version sent to CuD) the last
section of that last sentence - it was supposed to have been
"Cooperation between the CyberAngels and such government organizations
as the FBI does not discourage the dread of the aforementioned
phenomenon.")

Thank you for this information; I will avoid thinking of the Red Cross as
competent in the future. In the specific context - namely, how the
phrase in question was _allegedly_ applied to CuDigest participants - my
definition, related to the imposition of regulations (or cooperation in
the imposition of regulations) for allegedly beneficial purposes, does
appear to still be valid.

>Be very careful when you start generalizing, and defining terms for people.

It is admittedly possible that "Gabriel" was instead meaning an accusation
against CuDigest participants for being suspicious of the _competencies_,
not intentions, of the CyberAngels. Given that he did not cite any
examples of opposition to _non-regulatory_ agency "do-gooding", this
interpretation would make his point even more invalid. (In other words,
he claimed that CuDigest participants were generally disparaging of
"do-gooding." If, by this, he accused CuDigest participants of a cynical
distrust of anyone trying to help (instead of my more specific
interpretation of anyone trying to help via regulation), he would need
to bring up examples of such alleged distrust when not dealing with
regulatory agencies and proponents.)
