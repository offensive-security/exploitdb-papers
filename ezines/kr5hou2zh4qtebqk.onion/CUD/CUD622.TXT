Subject: File 1--CuD typos (6.21-"Rape in Cyperspace / 6.21-Newsday article)

In CuD 6.21, the moderators' note indicated that the Village Voice
"Rape in Cyberspace"  "...may not be reprinted *WITH* the author's
permission."

This should have read: "...may not be reprinted *WITHOUT* the authors
permission." Readers who distribute CuDs should correct this typo
before redistributing.

In CuD 6.19, we indicated in the CuD response to the Newsday article
(File 3) that in the '93 Congressional hearings on wire fraud one of
the participants judged 2600 Magazine to be a primer for crime. In an
inadvertant typo, the line appeared "which we" (ie, CuD), when the
line should have been "when *HE*" (the participant) considered 2600 to
be "dangerous." CuD does not consider 2600 "dangerous" or an advocacy
manual for crime.

We apologize for both errors and thank the readers who brought them to
our attention.

"CYBERSPACE SUPERHIGHWAYS: ACCESS, ETHICS and CONTROL

Cyberspace, Information Superhighway, National Information
Infrastructure, Open Platforms, Computer and Communications
Revolution, Electronic Networks, Digital Data Bases and Information
Society are words and phrases common to the rhetoric of our modern
era.  The relationships between and among individuals, society,
nations, government entities and business organizations are in
constant flux as new stresses and alliances change the old "rules
of the game."  Today's challenges are to define what is the "game,"
who owns the "franchises," who can play, what are the rules and who
calls the shots.  Information and communications technology raise
new issues for freedom and privacy in this new era.  Such questions
are on the agenda as the participants in CFP'94 consider the
alternatives and seek some solutions.  Come, join in the dialogue
that will help to shape the world's future!

PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS

On Wednesday March 23, the day before the formal conference begins,
CFP '94 is offering a number of in-depth tutorials covering a wide
variety of subjects on five parallel tracks.  These presentations
will be interesting, educational, thought-provoking and often
controversial.  The tutorials are available at a nominal additional
registration cost.

CONFERENCE NEWSPAPER

On each of the three days of the conference, a daily newspaper will
appear to highlight what has transpired and announce important
coming events.  The staff of "The Decisive Utterance," The John
Marshall Law School's student newspaper, is providing this service.


CONFERENCE RECEPTION AND TECHNOLOGY DISPLAY

On Wednesday evening, from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m., you are invited
to meet new and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception
at the John Marshall Law School from 6:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. The School
is only two blocks from the conference hotel.  A state-of-the-art
computer lab will be used to demonstrate high-tech applications in
academia and registrants will be invited to take part.

SINGLE-TRACK MAIN PROGRAM

The technological revolution that is driving change in our society
has many facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit
together, especially those parts that lie outside one's own daily
experience. An important goal of CFP '94 is to bring together
individuals from disparate disciplines and backgrounds and engage
them in a balanced discussion of CFP issues.  To this end our main
program, starting on Thursday, March 24, is on a single track
enabling registrants to attend all sessions.  The concurrent Birds-
of-a-Feather meetings Thursday after 9:15 p.m. are exceptions.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER SESSIONS (BoF)

CFP '94 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to
interested individuals for informal "Birds of a Feather" sessions
after the formal program Thursday, from 9:15 p.m. - 11:15 p.m.
These sessions will provide an opportunity for special-interest
discussions. For further information or to request a BoF contact
CFP '94 Program Coordinator, Gary Gassman, at the John Marshall Law
School (6gassman@jmls.edu)


MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY GALA

Registrants are invited to a very special reception and buffet at
Chicago's famed Museum of Science and Industry where they also will
be treated to a private showing and demonstration of the MSI's
newly-opened Communications and Imaging Exhibits.  These multi-
million dollar presentations occupy 15,000 sq.ft. of museum space
and required three years to develop.  "Communications" is a
panoramic display of how technology has transformed our lives by
dissolving distance and and making connections; visitors can even
enter the unreal world of virtual reality. "Imaging" is a mind-
boggling journey through modern applications of imaging technology.
Visitors can even play the role of brain surgeon, using
radiosurgery made possible by 3-D imaging, or explore imaging in
forensic science by using MRI, fingerprint enhancement, face aging
and other modern technologies to solve a crime!

REGISTRATION WILL BE LIMITED

CFP '94 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise
you to register early to assure admission and to take advantage of
the early registration discounts.

MEALS AND RECEPTIONS

A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction
between the diverse communities that constitute our audience.  To
promote this interaction CFP '94 provides three luncheons, three
receptions and three evening meals with the price of registration.

EFF PIONEER AWARDS

All conference attendees are invited to the EFF Pioneer Awards
Reception sponsored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation on
Thursday evening.  These, the third annual EFF Pioneer Awards, will
be given to individuals and organizations that have made
distinguished contributions to the human and technological realms
touched by computer-based communications.

CONFERENCE BUSINESS OFFICE

The Conference business and registration office will be open from
8:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on Wednsday thru Friday, and until 6:00
p.m. on Saturday, for registration and general information.

NOTE: The following program content and schedule is subject to
change. The Information Superhighway is a fast track!

Wednesday, March 23, 1994
Pre-Conference Tutorials

9:00 a.m. - noon

     Cyberspace Law for Non-Lawyers
     This tutorial presents an outline of the law for laymen,
     dealing with Constitutional and legal issues that confront
     those concerned with privacy, crime, and freedom of expression
     in cyberspace. There will be summaries of recent cases,
     legislative proposals and government activities.
          Mike Godwin, Online Counsel, EFF

     Rules of the Road for Network Travelers. (CLE Credit Approved)
     The information superhighway presents a variety of rights and
     risks.  Learn about the legal issues of computer networks,
     services and bulletin boards, including on-line property
     rights; protecting personal privacy and business information;
     electronic publishing and multimedia rights; viruses, adult
     materials and other no-nos.
          Lance Rose, Attorney and Author of "Syslaw."

     Get Mad, Get Motivated, Get Moving!
     The focus of this panel is on citizen action for privacy
     protection: how to reach and organize constituents; support
     legislation or other privacy protection measures; conduct
     public education activities; use the technology in program
     activities, etc.
          Robert Ellis Smith, Privacy Journal

     Exploring Internet: A Guided Tour
     This tutorial gives participants a practical introduction to
     the most popular and powerful applications available via the
     world's largest computer network, the Internet.  There will be
     hands-on demonstrations of communications tools such as e-
     mail, conferencing, Internet Relay Chat and resource discover,
     and navigations aids such as Gopher, WAIS, Archie and World
     Wide Web.  Extensive documentation will be provided.
          Mark Graham, Pandora Systems

     Using the Freedom of Information Act
     The Federal FOIA is the principal focus of this tutorial
     though some attention is given to the use of  state FOIAs.
     The session will cover procedures for making requests,
     identifying the information desired, differences between
     electronic and hard copy responses, and the appeals process
     within agencies and the courts.
     David Sobel, Counsel, Computer Professional for Social
     Responsibility

     2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

     Cryptography: What, and How?
     Data encryption is in the cyberspace limelight as perhaps the
     only technique to ensure digital privacy and security; it is
     also the subject of sharp debate regarding control of the
     development and use of the technology.  This tutorial will
     display what encryption is, how it works, and some of the
     options for its use.  Computer animations and graphic displays
     will be used to help make cryptography comprehensible; the
     audience will engage in some hands-on encryption exercises.
          Mark Hellmann, Pattishall, McAuliffe et.al, Chicago

     Electronic Detectives: Critical Issues for Public and Private
     Investigators.
     Both governmental and private sector investigators have
     unprecedented access to "open" sources that were practically
     inaccessible a few years ago.  This information environment
     poses opportunities and risks that will be the focus of this
     program.  Investigative techniques via networks will be
     demonstrat
ed and the legal, ethical and practical issues will be explored.
Actual case-studies will be utilized.
     Michael Moran, CCO; Michael Robertson, CFE

     Hi-Tech Intellectual Property Law Primer (CLE Credit Approved)
     This panel will cover the special problems in patent,
     copyright and tradmark law engendered by computers and digital
     technology, with attention to the impact of recent cases.  The
     differences in European protection will be surveyed as well as
     technology export restrictions.
          Raymond Nimmer, University of Texas Law School
          Leslie A. Bertagnolli, Baker & McKenzie, Chicago

     Transactional Data Analyses: Making FOI Access Useful
     Electronic communication, coupled with federal and state
     Freedom of Information Acts, has made a great deal of data
     available to the public regarding the activities and policies
     of government enforcement and regulatory agencies.  Knowing
     how to evaluate and use this information is critical to
     understanding and demonstrating what the data really means.
     The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of
     Syracuse University uses its various knowledge-bases to
     demonstrate the power of transactional data.  Colorgraphics
     and analytic techniques are combined in demonstrations of how
     otherwise drab statistics can be displayed dramatically to aid
     in policy analyses and advocacy.
          David Burnham, former New York Times Investigative
          Reporter;
          Susan Long, Co-director, TRAC, SUNY-Syracuse

     Election Fraud and Modern Technology
     There has been increasing attention, in the U.S. and abroad,
     to the use of modern technology in the electoral process.
     Buying votes, stealing votes, changing votes -- whether in the
     environment of punch-cards or fully automated voting machines
     -- is the subject of this tutorial.  Mock elections will be
     staged in which the participants have roles in planning to
     perpetrate as well as prevent vote fraud.  Voter registration,
     phone-based voting, cryptography and verification are among
     the strategies and technologies to be considered.
     Russel L. Brand, Reasoning Systems.

SPECIAL EVENTS ON WEDNESDAY, Mar. 23:

Noon - 4:00 p.m.,  Privacy International Business Meeting
     This meeting, at the John Marshall Law School, begins with a
     buffet luncheon.  Non-members interested in learning about
     P.I. and the Illinois Privacy Council are invited to be guests
     for lunch and a briefing. Guest space will be limited so
     attendance on a "first come" basis MUST be confirmed by
     March 8, 1994.

6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m.  Conference Reception
     All CFP registrants are invited to a reception and open house

     computer lab.  This also is an opportunity to "network" the
     old-fashioned way, meeting old friends and making new ones
     while enjoying the reception and buffet. This state-of-the-art
     facility will display information and communications
     technology being used in the educational environment. Guests
     also may participate in hands-on demonstrations of the
     technology under the tutelage of JMLS faculty and staff.

Thursday, March 24, 1994

8:30 a.m., CFP'94 Official Opening

     Welcome to the Conference: George B. Trubow, General Chair
     Welcome to Chicago: Hon. Richard M. Daley, Mayor (Invited)

9:00 a.m.  Keynote Address:  Mr. John Podesta, Assistant to the
          President, Washington, D.C.

10:00 a.m. Break

10:30 a.m.  The Information Superhighway: Politics and the Public
           Internet.
     The Administration and Congress propose policies that will
     lead to a digital multimedia highway.  How can the road be
     built at affordable cost while serving the public interest and
     our constitutional values?
     Chair: Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation


12:00 p.m.  Lunch
               Speaker: U.S. Senator Paul Simon (Invited)

1:30 p.m.  Is It Time for a U.S. Data Protection Agency?
     Beginning with the Privacy Act of 1974, proposals to establish
     an oversight body for data protection have been offered but
     not adopted; another proposal is currently pending in
     Congress.  Against a background of almost twenty years
     experience under the Privacy Act, the panel will consider
     whether the current political, economic and technological
     mileau favors establishment of a data protection agency.
     Chair: Priscilla M. Regan, George Mason University

 2:45 p.m.  Break
  3:00 p.m.  "Owning and Operating the NII: Who, How, When?"
     The National Information Infrastructure is an important
     initiative for the present Administration.  This panel will
     explore policy and technical issues such as equity and access,
     connectivity and standards, funding and regulation, privacy
     and security, ownership and operation.
     Chair: Marc Rotenberg, Computer Professionals for Social

 4:15 p.m.  Break

 4:30 p.m.  Data Encryption: Who Holds The Keys?
     Recent attempts, led by federal law enforcment agencies, to
     control the development and dissemination of strong
     cyptography programs has engendered considerable discussion
    and disagreement.  The interests of law enforcement agencies
     may conflict with the need for data security and personal
     privacy demanded by users of electronic networks.  This panel
     will evaluate proposals to deal with the question.
     Moderator: Willis Ware, Rand Corporation

5:30 p.m. Adjourn

6:00 p.m.  EFF Awards Reception
     Once again, the Electronic Frontier Foundation hosts a
     reception prior to its annual Pioneer Awards presentation.
     All CFP attendees are invited to enjoy the recepiton and
     congratulate the new honorees.

7:00 p.m.  Conference Banquet (Speaker to be announced)

Friday, March 25, 1994.

8:30 a.m.  Keynote: David Flaherty, Data Protection Commissioner,
           Victoria, British Columbia

9:15 a.m.  Health Information Policy
     The Clinton Health Reform Plan, and variations on that theme,
     stress the use of information technology to help the
     efficiency and effectiveness of health care.  Expert
     consultation, improved service delivery through new
     technology, and improvements in the processing of health
     insurance claims bring promise of cost cuts as well as the
     possibilities of threats to personal privacy.  This panel of
     experts will form the "CFP Group" to explore these promises
     and threats.
     Chair: Robert R. Belair, Mullenholz & Brimsek, Wash., D.C.

10:30 a.m.  Break

10:45 a.m.  Can Market Mechanisms Protect Consumer Privacy?
     When does protection of consumer privacy require legal
     standards and government regulation and when can bargains and
     agreements in the market suffice?  What role do new
     technological options for individuals and organizations play
     in facilitating private choice and market transactions?  Is
     "ownership" of personal information a useful concept or a dead
     end for privacy protection in an information age?
     Chair: Dr. Alan F. Westin, Columbia University

Noon      Lunch, Speaker: Philip Zimmerman, PGP

1:30 p.m.  Creating an Ethical Community in Cyberspace
     The fundamental ethical questions posed by the "settlement" of
     cyberspace are not new.  What is new is that the relationship
     between behavior and the ethical conceptions by which we judge
     behavior shift and become more ambiguous and vague.  This
     sessions examines the ethical dilemmas brought about by the
     "colonization" of cyberspace that must be resolved to
     establish and maintain a stable, humane environment.
     Chair: Prof. Jim Thomas, Northern Ilinois University

3:00 p.m.  Standards for Certifying Computer Professionals
     The subject of licensing of computer professionals is
     receiving increased attention by professional organizations
     and by state legislatures.  Both the ACM and IEEE have
     proposals under study, and perhaps a half-dozen states are
     considering licensing bills.  This panel will consider the
     pros and cons and suggest some standards for certification.
     Chair: Donald Gotterbarn, East Tennessee State Univ.

4:30 p.m.  Hackers and Crackers: Using and Abusing the Networks
     This session will explore issues surrounding the "fringe" of
     network use.  What can and should be exchanged?  Who will
     monitor "appropriate" use?   What's the current difference, if
     any, between "hacker" and "cracker"?  What should be expected
     and accepted regarding the role of law enforcement agencies?

9:00 a.m.  The Role of Libraries on the Information Superhighway
     As the information landscape changes dramatically the historic
     role of libraries as the "information commons" is challenged.
     How will the Carnegie ideal of free, public access be
     implemented by the library community?  Should it be?  This
     panel will consider policy for an information network in the
     public interest.
     Moderator: Tamara J. Miller, President, Library and
                Information Technology Association

10:30 a.m.  International Governance of Cyberspace: New Wine in Old
               Bottles -- Or Is It Time For New Bottles?
     Much discussion transpires between members of the Economic
     Community, the O.E.C.D., the Council of Europe, and the United
     States, regarding data protection, intellectual property
     rights, transborder data flow, the mediation of disputes, etc.
     This panel will consider whether existing mechanisms can solve
     the problems or a new structure for the governance of
     cyberspace is needed.

          International

1:30 p.m. The Electronic Republic: Delivery of Government Services
        over the Information Superhighway
     State and local governments use computer networks to deliver
     a wide range of services and information to the public;
     electronic "kiosks" are moving to "government by ATM."  How
     will this interaction between government and the people affect
     the process of American government in the future?
     Chair: Dennis McKenna, Publisher, "Government Technology."

2:45 p.m.  Break

3:00 p.m. Education and NREN, K - 12
     Internetworking is a very new technology being rapidly
     deployed to conventional classrooms, a very old technology.
     The panel will explore the clash of contradictory assumptions
     embedded within these systems -- a clash which has profound
     implications for the future of both the network and the
     classrooom.
     Chair: Steven Hodas, NASA NREN Project


4:00 Break

4:15 p.m.  Guarding the Digital Persona
     After this panel has established the threats to personal
     privacy from individual profiling and target marketing, and a
     regime to legally recognize and protect an "electronic
     personality" is put forth, Bruce Sterling will offer to
     explain why much of that worry is misdirected!
     Chair: Roger Clarke, Australian National University
