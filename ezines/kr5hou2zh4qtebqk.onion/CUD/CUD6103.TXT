We have a Problem . . .

H. Keith Henson

Part of the Federal Government's law enforcement mechanism is under
the control of the Religious Right.

By reaching out thousands of miles through cyberspace connections, the
RR is using Federal power to suppress constitutionally protected
activities which they find offensive.

I expect the RR people involved feel that what they are doing is fair
return for Federal power being used to suppress the school Christmas
pageant in a thousand sleepy little towns in middle America--and less
dangerous than offing abortion doctors, or killing gays.

Most of you reading these groups are familiar with the AA BBS case.

In a nutshell, a postal inspector in Memphis called Amateur Action BBS
in California, downloaded a dozen files, ordered other stuff, shipped
the sysop some unsolicited kiddy porn, then arrested the sysop (Robert
Thomas) and his wife (Carleen) for kiddy porn and (by Memphis standards)
obscenity.  They were tried in Memphis last summer by an obviously
biased court.  (The judge and prosecutor made no attempt to hide their
longstanding mutual admiration.)  The Memphis jury found the sysop
and his wife guilty of obscenity, but even they couldn't buy the kiddy
porn charges, and acquitted on that charge.  Friday (Dec. 2, 1994), in
the worst perversion of justice I have ever witnessed, the sysop and
his wife were sentenced to three years.

They were lucky to get that little time.

I got a look at the pre-sentencing report.  (I may be able to post
some of it later.)  The recommended sentence included about twice this
amount of time based on the kiddy porn charge they were *acquitted*
of.

Those reports are simply *amazing*.  They cover family members and
history out a generation or so in all directions, not to mention
school, medical records, tax filings, and any police record--even if
you were found innocent!  It seems to be the function of these things
to put your entire life in the worst possible light.

Someone should take the form and do one for Christ just prior to the
Crucifixion.  It would run something like:

   ". . . questionable father, . . low class occupation (carpenter), .
   . . accused of impersonating a doctor by healing sick, . . . known
   to associate with low class persons, . . . travels about
   (vagabond), . . ."

Back to the problem.

I find the situation intolerable--without having a clear idea of how
to deal with it.

With little more effort (though a lot more skill than the postal
inspector demonstrated) the RR-controlled Feds can create crime and
venue problems for just about anyone running a BBS or net node.

Certainly *any* system which carries alt.sex.* is subject to the same
treatment by the Religious Right (in the guise of the Memphis Feds) as
AA BBS.  In fact, the very .gifs that were found obscene in Memphis
were made "freely distribute," by Robert and have been posted *many*
times to the net.

Could we use economic retaliation?  I won't use Federal Express any
more because it and Graceland (and the cat houses near Graceland) seem
to be the economic mainstays of Memphis.  Unfortunately, even a very
effective economic boycott is not going to have an effect on the
zealots, and depressing that area further might make it an even *more*
repressive backwater because the last of the intelligent/tolerant
people would move out.  On the other hand, economic pressures might
induce the more sensible part of the community to pressure the zealots
into being more tolerant (at least of people 3 time zones away!).  In
recent years economic pressure has induced two states to change laws.
A positive sign that economic pressure might be effective is that the
local newspaper did *not* support the prosecution.  Research question:
Why did the Memphis Feds back off after the Deep Throat trials?

Is the law any help?  After nearly a year of watching the process, I
am *quite* pessimistic.  In its own way, the court system is deeply
corrupt.  I think even the RR folks know this is a political case and
not a criminal one.  In political cases, leaving a person out on bail
during appeal is normal, but in this case, it is very much in the
government's interest to have Robert out of circulation so he cannot
pursue the Electronic Communication Privacy Act suit and other causes
of action against them in civil court.  Robert's motion for bail
during appeal was denied.

Are there political routes?  Yes, but chancy.  It is possible that a
political fight with the RR might backfire and result in heavy
restrictions on the nets.  Coming down hard on the nets would be very
popular with the Administration forces after the Clipper debacle.  The
power of the net to organize political force must be quite worrying
to those in power. (It is clear to me that modern day revolutions,
anywhere in the world, and peaceful or not, would be organized through
the net.  In some places this has already happened.)  It may be that a
general cutting down on the powers of the Federal Government is in
order.  This has pros and cons, and support (in some areas) even from
the RR.  How *does* one shrink the unshrinkable?  Tax revolts (in the
form of massive political pressure) seem to come about when the tax
rates get as high as they are now.  Another possibility is that the
formation of private money may greatly shrink the ability of
governments everywhere to collect taxes.

Should people start thinking about direct action?  I hope we don't
come to this!  There is nothing I can think of worse than arousing the
technically knowledgeable to take the infrastructure apart.  Problem
is that pinpoint damage (like taking the 901 area code down for a few
days or weeks) is somewhere between impossible and probably
impossible.  (Though ATT managed to take down their entire phone
network for a day with a missing "case" statement.)

Your thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated.  Please post
encrypted through a remailer chain if you absolutely *must* post ideas
about the last paragraph!

Article follows:
MICROSOFT LEAD BROKE COMPUTER OBSCENITY CASE
12/2/94
by Jonathan Sidener
The Arizona Republic

 The key elements of an obscenity investigation against a state Department of
Public Safety officer were gathered by the world's largest developer of
software, not by public law-enforcement officers.
 According to court records released late Thursday, a principal investigator
in a case that led to the seizure of computer equipment and the temporary
shutdown of a pay-for-access bulletin board is an employee of Microsoft Corp.
 A leading computer-rights attorney said Microsoft's role in the
investigation was unusual.  But authorities defended Microsoft's role as
routine and appropriate.
 When asked why a private corporation was involved in a criminal
investigation of obscenity rather than in copyright or other corporate
issues, an official with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office said it is
common for software, telephone or credit-card investigators to pass along
information of possible crimes to law-enforcement investigators.
 The Microsoft investigator prowled the Phoenix "Wish Book" bulletin board in
August, September and October and downloaded electronic images of bestiality
and sexual acts involving excrement, according to the records in a
search-warrant affidavit.
 The records say David Swartzendruber investigates software piracy for
Microsoft's law and corporate-affairs department.
 The Wish Book was a bulletin board raided Tuesday by the DPS.  DPS Officer
Lorne Shantz, 38, who operated the bulletin board from his Phoenix home, was
suspended with pay pending the outcome of the investigation.
 Warrants also were served on the residences of Bob Barbee and Stan
Rosenblatt, who were co-operators of the system.
 Shantz, a 14-year veteran of DPS, began the bulletin board in August 1988.
 No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three.  Shantz has
declined to comment on the advice of attorneys.
 The affidavit gives this account of the steps leading to the investigation:
 Officials received allegations from DPS Sgt. Dan Mitchell and two
"confidential informants" that Shantz's bulletin board was distributing child
pornography.  No evidence of child pornography has been found.
 Swartzendruber began searching for copyright violations and child
pornography in late August.  On at least two occasions in September and at
least one in October, he found what was called "obscene materials" and
downloaded them.  Swartzendruber provided the files to DPS investigators.
 Deputy County Attorney Gail Thackeray defended Microsoft's role in the
investigation.  She said she and DPS already had opened an investigation into
Wish Book when Microsoft approached them with information about the reputedly
obscene materials.
 Thackeray said a Phoenix police detective who had been brought into the
investigation by the County Attorney's Office later found on his own in Wish
Book the images Microsoft had provided to investigators.
 "Private investigators routinely exchange information with law-enforcement
officials, and it's not unique to the computer industry," Thackeray said.
 But Michael Godwyn, an attorney for the Electronic Freedom Foundation,
questioned Microsoft's role in the Wish Book case.
 Godwyn made his comments Thursday before the affidavits were released and
before the full extent of Microsoft's role was made public.  He could not be
reached late Thursday.
 A call to Microsoft's public-relations office in Redmond, Wash., was not
returned.
 Barnett Lotstein, special assistant to County Attorney Rick Romley, said
Arizona obscenity statutes specifically define as obscene materials depicting
bestiality or explicit materials involving excrement.
 "This is Justice Stewart stuff," Lotstein said, referring to Supreme Court
Justice Potter Stewart, who said that he couldn't define obscenity, but that
he knew it when he saw it.
 "This clearly falls within our statute," Lotstein said.
 Lotstein said the seizure of computer equipment was not intended to shut
down the bulletin board.  He said the equipment will be returned after
authorities are able to copy all of the computer files.
 The search warrant specifies that only the electronic mail of the three
system operators would be read.

                             K.K. CAMPBELL


In that insatiable quest for coverage of the 3 Ps -- pornography,
pedophilia and piracy -- reporters will stop at nothing. Hell, they'll
even manufacture the tale.

On Oct. 10, some person named Tom Kavanagh (tomk@io.org) wrote a post
called "RESEARCHING COMPUTER PORN _ HELP WANTED" to newsgroup
ont.general. Ol' Tom posted for reporter Jeffrey Kofman.

CBC's Kofman [CBC is Canada's national broadcast outlet] writes: "Have you
discovered the limitless range ofcomputer porn? Have you discovered your
kid/student discovering thesame? I am a CBC- TV journalist preparing a report
on computerpornography and I am looking for people who are prepared to talk
abouttheir own experiences.

"I'd like to meet some teenage kids who can navigate through the world
of computer porn and who can show me what they've found. I'd also like
to meet parents and teachers who have come across their kids/students
exploring this world."

Ain't that special?

Kofman doesn't even have a net account. He has to get some third person
to post his request. Yet he's the one who's going to "inform" the
public about the porn-percolating net.

When are large news organizations going to wake up and realize they
have to hire someone who has a working knowledge of the net? General
assignment reporters can't be expected to know everything, but come on,
people -- do you send someone to cover Queen's Park who doesn't even
understand what the hell Ontario is?

The only public response I saw came the next day from Justin Wells
(rjwells@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca) -- a satire of Kofman's post:

"I am a yellow journalist preparing a sensationalistic story on the
information superhighway, and I am looking for people prepared to
provide me with shocking and unrepresentative anecdotes from their own
experiences."

                       TO BOLDLY GO BRAIN-DEAD

Not to be outdone, CTV proudly entered its candidate for eye's First
Annual Stupid Net Coverage Awards with a full-page ad for some TV show
called William Shatner's Tekwar. The Nov. 2 ad ran in Starweek (The
Star's TV guide thing) featured the bold headline: "In 2044, drugs
aren't sold on the street. They're sold on the Internet." The ad shows
some white-bread male model pointing a plastic space-gun (it's 2044
after all!) at some darker-skinned non-white-bread male model --
clearly right in the middle of an exciting  drug bust on the Infobahn.

Brilliant work, Captain.

                       JANET MARSTEN REPORTS...

Displaced Torontonian Janet Marsten (janet.marsten@almac.co.uk --
that's Scotland) writes to EYE.NET: "After reading your article on the
media and the net a few weeks back [August 4], I thought you might
enjoy this little piece of misinformation and hype. I wanted you to
know that the media hype on this side of the Atlantic is just as
ignorant, inaccurate and sensationalist as it is there. The only
difference is that few people have even heard of Karla Homolka!"

Net.trooper Marsten sends an article from the Oct. 8 edition of The
Scotsman -- Scotland's national newspaper -- called "Cook Book With A
Nasty Taste." It's a story about The Anarchist's Cookbook and how the
unregulated net corrupts children!

The Anarchist's Cookbook dates back to 1971, long before the net as we
know it. It circulates cyberspace and I've seen it a few times. Last I
checked, you can grab a copy at anon FTP extro.ucc.su.oz.au in
/tmp/apple .

It tells how to make bombs, how to make LSD, etc. -- guerilla warfare
stuff. It's generally shunned as poorly researched. Indeed, some even
suggest it was created by some disinformation agents during the
turbulent '60s and early '70s by something like COINTELPRO, the FBI
counter intelligence program which tried to fuck-up radicals by
disseminating incorrect info.

Anyway, three Scottish kids (all under age 16) were dragged before the
court for credit card fraud. They scammed ^\1,734 of computer gear and
games. To hear the adults tell it, the kids were corrupted by the
"evil" Cookbook file circulating the net. The Scotsman uses the file as
a peg to mention that the net has mountains of dirty pictures... and
even images of people being beheaded in Vietnam! What a bunch of sickos
these netters are.

Shovel away this panic-mongering, what did the kids actually do? They
picked up the phone and called people, hoping to find adults stupid
enough to give out their credit card numbers to a complete stranger.
The kids then used info given them by mentally-challenged adults to
order computer stuff. As if anyone needs the Cookbook to figure that
out.

The mother of one of the boys says she's only speaking out to warn
mothers everywhere about the evil Cookbook and the net. She notes,
ominously, that the disk with the Cookbook file on it "looked no
different from any other in the disk box." The judge ordered the disk
confiscated, hoping that would end the matter. But the mother warns
"the disk" has been circulating "in the south of England."

Unfortunately mom lets slip the real story here: "The boys phoned about
15 people and of the 15 they got 11 'no's. I'm quite convinced that if
the other four had told them to 'bugger off,' then the boys would have
just given up."

No protecting people from their own stupidity. Of course, when news
media try to whip up hysteria, the stupidity of others becomes a
control weapon.

Oh yeah, BTW -- you can buy civilization-threatening The Anarchist's
Cookbook at the World's Biggest Bookstore (Barricade Books, $34.75
cloth).  [World's Biggest Bookstore is nothing but a huge Toronto bookstore.]

Personal computers are being used more and more as a source of

 evidence of "double-book" accounting or hidden personal assets. Not
 only can a spouse's computer contain financial records but
 information relative to the calendared activities of a person. Many
 states, however, have written their computer crime laws so that such
 access may be a crime.

The Technology Revolution is touching every aspect of our lives.
Its impact has perhaps been most profound on the way things are
made, and with it, on jobs.

The Midwest Conference on Technology, Employment and Community
will focus on the impact of the Technology Revolution on economic
life, and its social consequences. With the impact of new
technologies on production, transportation, and communications, we
are entering a new historical period of change.

The conference is appropriately set in Chicago, once synonymous
with heavy industry. But with the shrinkage and disappearance of
the steel mills, the meat-packing plants, and other large scale
production, the industrial job loss has devastated many of
Chicago's working class neighborhoods. This pattern has been
repeated in communities throughout the region.

At the same time though, the productivity of new technologies
offers great promise for satisfying the basic needs of all
citizens, of delivering the world's information to every home, and
of providing new and exciting ways of developing as human beings.

This conference will provide an opportunity for scholars,
community leaders, trade unionists, and anyone else concerned
about the future of their communities and livelihood to discuss
the impact and possibilities of the Technology Revolution, and
look at how new technologies can be deployed to raise everyone's
standard of living. The conference will also provide technology
demonstration sites, and provide opportunities to learn about the
new technologies.

The Midwest Conference on Technology, Employment and Community
will mix plenary sessions with workshops. We encourage your
participation both through attending the conference and through
conducting a workshop or organizing a panel. We are currently
soliciting workshop proposals. We suggest proposals on the themes
below, but any topic related to the conference purpose is welcome.
Community activists and off-campus researchers are encouraged to
organize panels.


 Employment                      Community

  + Privacy
  + Access to information
  + Electronic town meetings
  + Technologies of surveillance and control
  + The new eugenics movement

Workshops and panels will be an hour and half in length. The
proposal should include title, presenter, purpose of workshop,
references, and plan. We encourage workshops that substantially
involve the audience; and proposals in which some group product or
action plan is created are preferred. As the proposals may be
collected into a book, workshop proposals should be clear and
informative to people who don't participate in the workshop.

Proposals are due January 8, 1995 and acceptance and rejection
notices will be sent by February 1, 1995. Electronic submissions
are encouraged but paper versions are also acceptable.

      ANNOUNCING NEW ACTION-ORIENTED, POLITICS OF SCIENCE &

             TECHNOLOGY ELECTRONIC DISCUSSION LISTS:

                          POL-SCI-TECH

                               and

          FASTnet (FEDERATION OF ACTIVISTS ON SCIENCE &

                       TECHNOLOGY NETWORK)

     Many recipients of Loka Alerts have been asking for some
time:  How can I communicate and collaborate directly with others
on the Loka e-mail list?  Two, complementary answers are now at
hand:

     (1) If you are interested in promoting a more democratic
politics of science and technology within the United States,
please join the new electronic discussion list: FASTnet
(Federation of Activists on Science and Technology Network).

     To subscribe to FASTnet send an e-mail message to:

          majordomo@igc.apc.org

     Leave the subject line blank.  The text of the message
should be:

          subscribe FASTnet


     (2) If you are interested in discussing democratic politics
of science and technology anywhere in the world (i.e., not only
in the U.S.) and forging new transnational collaborations, please
join FASTnet's new sibling list: pol-sci-tech.
     To subscribe to pol-sci-tech send an e-mail message to:

          majordomo@igc.apc.org

     Leave the subject line blank.  The text of the message
should be:

          subscribe pol-sci-tech


     (Of course, you are welcome to subscribe to both FASTnet and
pol-sci-tech.)  Upon subscribing, you will receive a message
describing each list's purpose and operation in greater detail.

     NOTE TO NEW SUBSCRIBERS:  As with all pioneering electronic
ventures, please be a little patient during the inevitable period
of start-up wobbles and glitches.  FASTnet and pol-sci-tech
represent important new attempts to foster cross-issue awareness
and alliances that can help promote a more socially responsive
politics of science and technology.

     Loka Alert subscribers who wish to keep their e-mail traffic
low need do nothing.  Loka Alerts will continue to arrive at
periodic, well-spaced intervals.  However, you may also choose to
subscribe temporarily to FASTnet or pol-sci-tech whenever you
want to post your own alert or inquiry, and then unsubscribe
after receiving replies.

                       *        *        *

     Loka Alerts, FASTnet, and pol-sci-tech are activities of the
broader Public Interest Technology Policy Project (a
collaborative effort of the Loka Institute and the Institute for
Policy Studies).  The Project is pleased to announce that its
1994 start-up grants from the Menemsha Fund and Rockefeller
Family Associates have just been supplemented by a $50,000 grant
from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

     Unlike the open electronic conferences FASTnet and pol-sci-
tech, Loka-L (the distributor of Loka Alerts) represents a one-
way news-and-opinion dissemination service.  If you would like to
be added to, or removed from Loka-L, please send an e-mail
message to that effect to: resclove@amherst.edu
