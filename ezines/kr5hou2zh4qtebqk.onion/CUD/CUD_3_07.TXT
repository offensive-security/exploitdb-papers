Apology to a valuable contributor
++++++++++++

Sometimes letters are published that were not so-intended by the authors to be
published. We indicate in the header that we assume notes may be published,
and as a rule, even though we assume letters may be published, we double check
"just in case." When we ask for a copy of an article or note that someone has
written, we generally assume, whatever wording we use, that it's understood
that it is for publication. Even if a note has been posted publicly on the
nets and an author sends us a copy, we still try to check. Unfortunately,
signals are sometimes crossed and an article slips into publication which an
author prefered to not to be. We regret when this occurs, but it is the result
of legitimate misunderstandings and not the result of any attempt to bypass
author prerogative. Given the amount of mail we receive and weekly schedule, in
addition to net-lag that may delay a response until *after* a post has been
published, miscommunication can arise. We regret such occurances and apologize
to a recent valuable contributor to whom this happened.

+++++++++++++
Corrected NIA Address
+++++++++++++

In the last issue of CuD, the wrong nuchat address for NIA was listed by
mistake. The *CORRECT* address for NIA submissions and correspondence is:
   ELISEM@NUCHAT.SCCSI.COM
We regret any inconvenience caused to those on the mistakenly
listed account.

Call for Articles
+++++++++++++++++

For the next few issues, we are especially looking for articles from
readers on: (1) State of the CU (p/h and pirate) BBS community; (2) Views
on such issues sysop liability on BBSs, e-mail privacy on BBS and mainframe
(university or employer) systems,; and (3) Surveillance of BBSs by local,
state or federal LE agents.

Subject: Robert Miles - "computer wizard"
Date: Sat, 23 Feb 91 23:08:00 PST

*Very* interesting article "The FBI comes rapping...".
But, on Robert Miles being a "computer wizard", well, in his own words:

"...in a computer journal, called PC/Computing, a nationwide publication,
out of Cambridge, Mass., there is an article by some lying idiot...in which
he calls me a computer wizard, and states that I was a defendant in the Berg
case in Denver. Sorry, about that old boy. I was never tried in Denver. The
friends who were, will be amazed to learn that I was a co-defendant in that
trial. And as for me being a 'computer wizard', wow, did that crack up
Dotty... I can hardly fix the toaster. ... So, what you read in this
article.... ha! ... Yesterday, ah couldn't spell one, now ah is one.....
.....a real live Computer Wizard."

"..." is where I have deleted irrelevant sections. "...." and "....." were
in the original text.

Not that this proves much, -- I trust Miles about as much as I trust the
media --  but in the pictures I've seen of him, he certainly doesn't *look*
like a techie type.

Subject: Civil Liberties and the Computer Underground
Date: February 23, 1991

Has CuD been intentionally backing off their earlier defense of civil
liberties? Recent issues lack the spark of earlier ones.  What's happening
with Len Rose? Why aren't there more articles on follow-ups to
investigations, Ripco, Secret Service activities, searches, Steve Jackson
Games, and all the issues that CuD started with? I enjoy the news and some
of the articles, but I subscribed because of you guys seemed about the only
ones willing to take a strong stand and speak out. Whatever happened with
the informant thing? Another issue I'd like to see raised is all the
anonymous posts in CuD and on the nets.  In one issue you said you publish
anonymously when people are afraid of reprisals. This reminds me of
McCarthyism, where people were afraid to speak out for fear of being
listed. Maybe the fear that the nets are monitored by vindictive types
(and there are a few of these on comp.org.eff.talk) or law enforcement.
Plus the fact that it's so easy to send hate mail and otherwise harass on
the nets. If you're being pressured or if people are complaining about you
being too pro-hacker or too radical, would you publish it, or would you
just allow yourselves to be co-opted? I'd personally like to see more fire
in between the other material.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(Editors' response: No, we haven't been pressured or in any way or
"encouraged" to change our position. Quite the opposite. Yes, we may have
become less strident--although there would be a few who would claim
otherwise. We have been advised to refrain from publishing anything
substantive about on-going cases by those involved in them for fear of
putting the principles at risk or of subverting legal strategies responding
to what many see as abuses of authority.  We're willing to publish articles
that are both radical and conservative, and we generally have not had many
articles from either extreme.  However, we do have two special issues
planned (tentatively 3.09 and 3.10) on government surveillance and what
people in the CU can do about it.

                Electronic Frontier Foundation
                        Job Announcement

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is looking to hire a Boston-based Director
of Communications (DoC) to become its second full-time employee.

A key aspect of the EFF's mission is to educate the public about the
opportunities and challenges posed to society by technological developments
in computers and telecommunications.  The Foundation has taken a leading
role in the effort to make sure that civil liberties are protected in the
exercise of communication through computer networks and electronic bulletin
boards.

The EFF's public education activities are carried out through a variety of
media including computer conferencing systems, public speaking, writing
articles for periodicals and newspapers, appearances at public and private
forums, its own publications including online and print newsletters, and a
variety of special projects and publications.

EFF Board members, staff, volunteers, and legal counsel all participate in
these activities.  The DoC will serve as a dedicated resource in these areas
in order to provide oversight and co-ordination, as well as to be a
principal contributor to the activities.

The ideal candidate will possess:

%       the ability to think clearly

%       the writing, editing, and speaking skills to convey ideas with
impact.  Needs to be able to deal with complex technical and legal issues by
simplifying without trivializing.

%       an understanding of the theory and practice of "The Marketing of
Ideas",  in order to reach journalists, computer professionals, politicians,
hackers, lawyers, and other groups

%       comfort with the world of  online communications and its "savage user
interfaces".

%       a strong idealistic streak, tempered by a knowledge of what is
possible.

%       perseverance and patience.

%       knowing when to use volunteers and when to use experts.  Has to be
able to co-ordinate the two in order to maximize limited resources. Needs to
know how to nudge.  A facilitator, not a dictator.

 General legal knowledge is a plus.

The position  is available immediately.  For  further information, contact:
        Mitchell Kapor
        Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc.
        155 Second St.
        Cambridge, MA 02141

        (617) 864-1550
        (617) 864-0866 (fax)

        mkapor@eff.org

Please post and circulate this announcement.

                         * CUD Goes To The Movies *

Jim Thomas challenged some friends and I to come up with the worst "hacker"
films that we'd seen.  What follows is only a partial list, and you've
probably got your own favorites, if that's the right word.  They're in no
particular order.  I know that I'm leaving a gold-mine of bad plot ideas
untouched by ignoring commercial television.  There's been one awful Booker
episode that weighed in at the Cargo Cult level of sophistication, for
example.  You probably can think of more.

          -- Bob

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
          Eight Bad Bits:  The Computer Underground Film Hall of Shame
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

          [ 1 ]     War Games.  The first of the big "Swatch hacker"
          movies.  It spawned a wave of original thinkers with "joshua"
          as their user id or password.  Were NORAD computers ever
          this insecure?  For about ten seconds back in the Dark Ages,
          maybe.
          [ 2 ]     Malibu Express.  High tech and low morals,
          courtesy of ex-ABC Sports producer Andy Sidaris.  I could
          say that this is a tightly plotted adventure which treats
          today's computer embezzlement headlines as a starting point.
          If you'd stop staring at the bimbos for a minute, you might
          agree with me.  The opening credits roll over some serious
          Nail Slicks risking death on an Atari keyboard.  This sets
          the tone for the whole film.
          [ 3 ]     Prime Risk.  Komputer Kids with job and bank
          problems spoof their least favorite bank's ATM network, only
          to find someone doing it on a bigger scale, for money
          instead of curiosity and revenge.  The understanding and
          empathetic Federal agent rescues them and thanks them for
          their vigilance.  Uh huh.  Note how Toni Hudson's character
          is scripted as a Renaissance nerd, as far above Gilda
          Radner's Lisa Lubner character as amoebas are above Dan
          Quayle.
          [ 4 ]     Colossus: The Forbin Project.  Jim Thomas voted
          for this one, in appreciation of a malevolent defense
          computer with no off switch.  It's the system manager's
          fairy tale:  it never crashes, never needs new parts, never
          has transmission problems.  How long it takes us to reach
          this cybernetic state of grace is left to the viewer's
          imagination.
          [ 5 ]     The Manhattan Project.  There's a reason, you
          know, why electrical supply houses aren't found in high-
          dollar shopping malls.  I'm sorry, but hipper-than-thou
          nerds are the stuff of Hollywood's Summer Slump cure.  Not a
          computer in the picture except as props, but there's a bit
          of hacker curiosity and humor in the script.
          [ 6 ]     Electric Dreams.  Computer oversell proves
          truthful when digiphobe Lenny Van Dohlen competes with his
          "Pineapple" computer for his neighbor's affections.
          [ 7 ]     The Running Man.  Hahahahahahahahah.  Arnold in
          Spandex yellow leotards.  Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa
          running the Revolutionary Left.  One hundred years from now,
          "Richard Bachman" will spin in his grave like a turbine
          whenever this is shown.  The "Weiss" character plays video
          skittles for a minute to crack the Secret Network Code. Rick
          Moranis says it best in Spaceballs:  "That's the combination
          an idiot would have on his luggage!"
          [ 8 ]     Tron.  A bitter triumph of Big Special Effects
          Bucks over story, guaranteed to make anyone who's ever heard
          of Mike Jittlov cry in anguish.  Picture the scriptwriter's
          meeting:  "You're not leaving this room until you've used
          every buzzword in this book!"  Must material to show off
          that new videodisc player or 50" monitor, however.  (No
          "bit player" jokes here, I gots too much class fer that.)

                              Dishonorable Mention
                            ------------------------

          [ 0 ]     Evilspeak.  The Devil's in my disk drive!  Military
          prep Clint Howard gets hazed by classmates, then seeks
          Satanic assistance from behind his keyboard.  Carrie without
          tampons for the high-tech set.  The Bad Sci-Fi numerologists
          hint that this (666) must be the sequel to The Andromeda
          Strain (601), digitwise.  Jeez, experts.
          [ 0 ]     The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes.  Always consider
          the Classics.  A kinda porky Kurt Russell gets a jolt and
          leaves Jockville behind for Braintown.  Old Walt might have
          known as much about computers as he did about animal
          behavior, but he did cut an acceptable teen yarn.
          [ 0 ]     Forbidden World.  Show this and you'll disappoint
          computerists and sci-fi fans alike.  Some gene-spliced oil
          slick expresses a difference of opinion about who's the Food Of
          The Future around here, anyway.  Later, it grows teeth and
          is found to have bio-hacked the base computer.  Type type, munch
          munch.  Stay tuned for (or beware of) the scientist who cuts

Subject: Sounds good... court ruling on BBS in SW Bell

From: Jim.Bellotte@f2.n106.z1.fidonet.org (Jim Bellotte)
Newsgroups: alt.cosuard
Subject: settlement
Date: 19 Feb 91 12:15:38 GMT

On January 9, 1991, the Texas Public Utilities Commission, on a vote of
3 to 0 approved a negotiated settlement in Texas PUC docket 8387.  This
is the case of Reginald A. Hirsch, et. al. vs Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company.  This case grew from Southwestern Bell's attempt to
assess business rates to all known BBSs.

The negotiated settlement provides for the following provision to be
added to the Southwestern Bell tariffs:

-------------Begin quotation from proposed stipulation---------------

          2.   Southwestern Bell agrees to amend Section 23,
Paragraph 3.1 of its General Exchange Tariff defining business
service to include the following footnote:

As a result of a Stipulation in Docket No. 8387 approved by the
Commission on ______, Southwestern Bell agrees that all Bulletin Board
Systems ("BBS") that are located at residence locations that do not
solicit, require, or receive monetary compensation and that use three or
fewer local exchange access lines shall be permitted to subscribe to
local exchange access service at the approved residential rates.  BBSs
that are eligible to subscribe to local exchange access service at
residential rates may publish their name, telephone number and technical
information in a listing of BBSs by location or subject matter.  Such
listings must be purely informational to advise readers of the BBS's
name, telephone number, location, subject matter, hours, baud rates, and
other technical information.  BBSs that do not meet these conditions
will be considered businesses, and approved business rates will apply
for all local exchange access lines used by such BBS.

-----------------------------End Quotation--------------------------

The stipulation also provides that Southwestern Bell will provide a
single point of contact for BBS operators and that for a period of 90
days after the PUC decision, they will waive service charges on orders
to change service from one class of service to another in order to
comply with settlement.

This has been a long fight.  The settlement is not what any of the
parties would consider perfect.  It does give BBS operators in Texas a
firm set of guidelines in which to operate.  They no longer have to play
"Russian Roulette", hoping that they reach a SWBT business office that
understands the rules.

    Michigan to Overhaul Telecom Rules  by Michael E. Marotta

    On February 19 and 20, companion bills were introduced into the
    state house and state senate of Michigan.  "The Michigan
    Telecommunications Act" is House Bill 4343  and Senate Bill 124.
    The two versions are identical.  HB4343 was introduced by Alma G.
    Stallworth (D-Detroit), chair of the House Public Utilities
    committee. SB124 was introduced by Mat J. Dunaskiss (R-Lake
    Orion), chair of the newly-created Senate Technology and Energy
    Committee.  If passed by October 1, 1991, the bills become law on
    that date and have sunset limits of four years, expiring on
    September 30, 1995.

    The Michigan Telecommunications Act would, if passed into law,
    accomplish the following:
        (*) establish a new regulator, the Michigan Telecommunications
            Commission, removing telephone from the Public Service
            Commission and bringing cable television under the new
            agency's scope.
        (*) de-regulate local exchange providers, allowing them
            monopoly status and the right to sell other services,
            including long distance, cable television and information.
        (*) freeze local rates at the current level, allowing no
            increase beyond the maximum rate as of Nov. 1, 1990.
        (*) require 911 service to be provided to any county that
            wants it.  In fact, there are 48 separate provisions for
            911 service, significantly more than any other section of
            the act.  (Mandatory service for the hearing impaired runs
            a mere 42 lines.)
        (*) Outlaw unsolicited advertising via fax.  (This provision,
            like many of the 911 rules, is already in place.  It was
            created in 1990 as an amendment to the Telephone Act of
            1913 and is being carried over.)

    The Michigan Telecommunications Act specifically seeks to overturn
    the "Modified Final Judgement."  Its goal is to allow Michigan
    telecom providers the freedom to develop products and services.
    Whether and to what extent it meets those goals will be determined
    in part by what happens to the bills in committees and on the
    floors.

Subject: 2600 banned from Texas Prisons
Date: March 4, 1991

MIDDLE ISLAND, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1991 MAR 4(NB) --
Emmanuel Goldstein, editor and publisher of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, has
told Newsbytes that The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has prohibited
delivery delivery of the fall 1990 issue of 2600 to a subscriber
incarcerated in a Texas prison.

The official "Publication Denial Notification" form, dated January 9, 1991,
was received by Goldstein and published in the Winter 1990-91 issue that
was released on March 1st. The form indicates that the denial was
instituted because "Publication contains material on the setting up and
operation of criminal schemes or how to avoid detection of criminal schemes
by lawful authority charged with the responsibility for detected such
illegal activity."

The specific reasons for determining the basis for the ruling are listed as
"Pages 18, 19, 20, 21, 29, 42 and 43 contain information on misusing
telephone equipment to make telephone calls illegally and to obtain cash
and credit cards illegally."

Goldstein, commenting on the ban to Newsbytes, said "Inside of prison,
there is not much freedom so I guess it's not surprising that they do
things like this. What is surprising is that the article which they were
most concerned with was written by the Fraud Division of the U.S. Secret
Service and was clearly indicated to have been so authored."

Newsbytes examined the Fall issue of 2600 and found that the Secret Service
technical synopsis is contained on pages 18-21 while page 29 is part of the
letters from readers section and contains a letter from a prisoner in an
unnamed prison explaining how he or she makes unpaid telephone calls. Pages
42 and 43 contain an article by "Crazed Luddite & Murdering Thug", "An
Algorithm For Credit Cards", which explains the checksum verification of
credit card numbers.

Also contained in the same issue is an interview with security expert Dr.
Dorothy Denning, an explanation of caller-id and an article by Goldstein on
alleged BellSouth plans for monitoring telephone lines.

A supervisor at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional
Division told Newsbytes that "Inmates may subscribe to any publication they
choose but they understand that the magazines are subject to review for
appropriateness. If they contain any material that does not meet or
standards, either the articles in question or the entire magazine will be
rejected." The supervisor, who could not speak for attribution, explained
that, if the objectionable passages were 5 pages or less, they would have
been removed and the remainder of the magazine delivered. She also said
that both the inmate and the publication have the right to appeal the
decision.
