* OECD releases Crypto Guidlines

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last
week announced its new Cryptography Policy Guidelines. Despite
pressure from the U.S. government to adopt a U.S.backed key escrow/key
recovery system, the leading industrial democracies took a stand that
instead strongly suppots privacy rights, and rejects key escrow.

International support for a market diven and voluntary system is a
huge step, and one the ACLU fully supports. The Global Internet
Liberty Coalition (GILC) and the ACLU held a conference in Paris in
September during the OECD gathering which contributed to a favorable
climate for the guidelines. Both the ACLU and GILC are appreciative of
the steps the Organization has taken towards protecting privacy and
urging removal of restrictions on cryptography.



The Guidelines set out eight basic Principles for cryptography policy:


 1.Cryptographic methods should be trustworthy in order to generate
confidence in the use of information and communications systems.

 2.Users should have a right to choose any cryptographic method,
subject to applicable law.

 3.Cryptographic methods should be developed in response to the needs,
demands and responsibilities of individuals, businesses and
governments.

 4.Technical standards, criteria and protocols for cryptographic
methods should be developed and promulgated at the national and
international level.

 5.The fundamental rights of individuals to privacy, including secrecy
of communications and protection of personal data, should be respected
in national cryptography policies and in the implementation and use of
cryptographic methods.

 6.National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to
plaintext, or cryptographic keys, of encrypted data. These policies
must  respect the other principles contained in the guidelines to the
greatest  extent possible.

 7.Whether established by contract or legislation, the liability
ofindividuals and entities that offer cryptographic services or hold
or access cryptographic keys should be clearly stated.

 8.Governments should co-operate to co-ordinate cryptography policies.
As part of this effort, governments should remove, or avoid creating
in the name of cryptography policy, unjustified obstacles to trade.

Subject: File 2--OECD Guidlines Released

The OECD Cryptography Policy Guidelines were formally announced
today, following an intensive year-long negotiation.
EPIC will be posting a complete copy of the Guidelines at our
web site [http://www.epic.org/] along with a detailed analysis.

Journalists interested in a briefing should contact the Communications
Division of the OECD. For further information and inquiries, please
contact the Information, Computer and Communications Policy Division
(fax (33) 01 45 24 93 32).

General information about the OECD may be found at the OECD web site
[http://www.oecd.org]. Specific information about the work of the OECD
in the areas of security, privacy, intellectual property, and cryptography
is available at http://www.oecd.org/dsti/iccp/legal/top-page.html.  The
OECD Privacy Principles are online at
http://www.oecd.org/dsti/iccp/legal/priv-en.html

Among the key outcomes:

 -- Recognition of commercial importance of cryptography.  The Guidelines
    recognize that cryptography is an effective tool for the secure use
    of information technology by ensuring confidentiality, integrity and
    availability of data and providing authentication and non-repudiation
    mechanisms.

 -- Rejection of key escrow encryption. The US sought endorsement
    for government access to private keys. Initial drafts of the
    guidelines included this recommendation. The final draft does
    not. OECD countries rejected this approach.

 -- Endorsement of voluntary, market-driven development of crypto
    products.  The OECD emphasized open, competitive markets to
    promote trade and commerce in new cryptographic methods.

 -- Endorsement of strong privacy safeguards. The OECD adopted one of
    strongest privacy principles found in any international agreement,
    including the obligation to apply the OECD privacy principles to
    crypto products and services.  The OECD also noted favorably the
    development of anonymous payment schemes which would minimize the
    collection of personal data.

 -- Removal of Restriction on Cryptography. The OECD urged member
    countries to remove, and avoid creating, obstacles to trade
    based on cryptography policy. This guideline should lead to
    further liberalization of export control policies among the
    OECD member countries.

EPIC will also provide briefings for organizations interested
in the intent and application of the OECD Cryptography Guidelines.

OECD News Release

          Paris, 27 March 1997

 OECD ADOPTS GUIDELINES FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

The OECD has adopted Guidelines for Cryptography Policy, setting out
principles to guide countries in formulating their own policies and legislation
relating to the use of cryptography.

The Recommendation which came before the governing body of the OECD, the
Council, on Thursday 27 March, is a non-binding agreement that identifies the
basic issues that countries should consider in drawing up cryptography policies
at the national and international level. The Recommendation culminates one
year of intensive talks to draft the Guidelines.

The need for Guidelines emerged from the explosive worldwide growth of
information and communications networks and technologies and the
requirement for effective protection of the data which is transmitted and
stored
on those systems. Cryptography is a fundamental tool in a comprehensive data
security system. Cryptography can also ensure confidentiality and integrity of
data and provide mechanisms for authentication and non-repudiation for use in
electronic commerce.

Governments want to encourage the use of cryptography for its data protection
benefits and commercial applications, but they are challenged to draft
cryptography policies which balance the various interest at stake, including
privacy, law enforcement, national security, technology development and
commerce. International consultation and co-operation must drive cryptography
policy because of the inherently international nature of information and
communications networks and the difficulties of defining and enforcing
jurisdictional boundaries in the new global environment.

The Guidelines are intended to promote the use of cryptography, to develop
electronic commerce through a variety of commercial applications, to bolster
user confidence in networks, and to provide for data security and privacy
protection.

Some OECD Member countries have already implemented policies and laws on
cryptography, and many countries are still developing them. Failure to
co-ordinate these national policies at the international level could introduce
obstacles to the evolution of national and global information and
communications networks and could impede international trade. OECD
governments have recognised the importance of international co-operation, and
the OECD has contributed by developing consensus on specific policy and
regulatory issues related to cryptography and, more broadly, to information
and communications networks and technologies.

The Guidelines set out eight basic Principles for cryptography policy:

    1.Cryptographic methods should be trustworthy in order to generate
       confidence in the use of information and communications systems.

    2.Users should have a right to choose any cryptographic method, subject
       to applicable law.

    3.Cryptographic methods should be developed in response to the needs,
       demands and responsibilities of individuals, businesses and
       governments.

    4.Technical standards, criteria and protocols for cryptographic methods
       should be developed and promulgated at the national and international
       level.

    5.The fundamental rights of individuals to privacy, including secrecy of
       communications and protection of personal data, should be respected
       in national cryptography policies and in the implementation and use of
       cryptographic methods.

    6.National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to plaintext, or
       cryptographic keys, of encrypted data. These policies must respect the
       other principles contained in the guidelines to the greatest extent
       possible.

    7.Whether established by contract or legislation, the liability of
       individuals and entities that offer cryptographic services or hold or
       access cryptographic keys should be clearly stated.

    8.Governments should co-operate to co-ordinate cryptography policies.
       As part of this effort, governments should remove, or avoid creating in
       the name of cryptography policy, unjustified obstacles to trade.

The Guidelines advise that the eight elements should be taken as a whole in an
effort to balance the various interests at stake. These Principles are
designed to
assist decision-makers in the public and private sectors in developing and
implementing coherent national and international policies for the effective use
of cryptography. Member countries should establish new, or amend existing,
policies to reflect them. Any national controls on use of cryptography should
be stated clearly and be publicly available.

Drafting of the Guidelines for Cryptography Policy began in early 1996, when
the OECD formed an Ad hoc Group of Experts under the chairmanship of Mr.
Norman Reaburn of the Attorney-General's Department of Australia. More
than 100 representatives from OECD Member countries participated, including
government officials from commerce, industry, telecommunications and
foreign ministries, law enforcement and security agencies, privacy and data
protection commissions, as well as representatives of private sector. The
Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD was involved and
experts on privacy, data protection and consumer protection also participated.

The policy recommendations in the Guidelines are primarily aimed at
governments, but it is anticipated that they will be widely read and
followed by
both the public and private sectors. Governments will now engage in further
consultation to co-ordinate and co-operate on the implementation of the
Guidelines. In the future, the Guidelines could form a basis for agreements on
specific issues related to international cryptography policy. The
Guidelines will
soon be published as an OECD document for broad distribution to promote
awareness and public discussion of the issues and policies related to
cryptography.

From: Crypt Newsletter <crypt@sun.soci.niu.edu>
Subject: File 4--Moynihan Commission hoisted on petard of Penpal hoax

From the pages of Crypt Newsletter:

April 3, 1997

Pasadena, CA -- In an astonishing gaffe, government intelligence
experts writing for the Moynihan Commission's recent "Report . . . on
Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy" reveal they've been
hooked on one of the Internet's ubiquitous e-mail computer virus hoaxes
known as "Penpal Greetings"!

In a boldly displayed boxed-out quote in a part of the report
entitled "Information Age Insecurity" authors of the report
proclaim:

"Friendly Greetings?

"One company whose officials met with the Commission warned its
employees against reading an e-mail entitled Penpal Greetings.
Although the message appeared to be a friendly letter, it
contained a virus that could infect the hard drive and destroy all
data present. The virus was self-replicating, which meant that
once the message was read, it would automatically forward itself
to any e-mail address stored in the recipients in-box."

The Penpal joke is one in half-a-dozen or so permutations spun
off the well-known GoodTimes e-mail virus hoax.  Variations on
GoodTimes have appeared at a steady rate over the past couple
years. Real computer security experts -- as opposed to the
Moynihan commission's -- now occasionally worry in the press that
they spend more time clearing up confusion created by such
tricks than destroying actual computer viruses.

The report's authors come from what is known as "the Moynihan
commission," a group of heavy Congressional and intelligence
agency hitters tasked with critiquing and assessing the Byzantine
maze of classification and secrecy regulation currently embraced by
the U.S. government.

Among the commission's members are its chairman, Daniel Moynihan;
vice-chairman Larry Combest, Jesse Helms, ex-CIA director John
Deutch and Martin Faga, a former head of the super-secret, spy
satellite-flying National Reconnaissance Office.

The part of the report dealing with "Information Age Insecurity"
merits much more comment.  But in light of the report's contamination by
the Penpal virus hoax, two paragraphs from the March 4 treatise become
unintentionally hilarious:

"Traditionally, computer security focuses on containing the effects of
malicious users or malicious programs. As programs become more complex,
an additional threat arises: _malicious data_ [Crypt Newsletter emphasis
added] . . . In general, the outlook is depressing: as the economic
incentives increase, these vulnerabilities are likely to be
exploited more frequently.

---W. Olin Sibert, 19th National Information Systems Security
Conference (October 1996)"

And,

"Inspector General offices, with few exceptions, lack the personnel,
skills, and resources to address and oversee information systems
security within their respective agencies. The President cannot turn to
an Information General and ask how U.S. investments in information
technology are being protected from the latest viruses, terrorists, or
hackers."

Got that right, sirs.

Notes: Other authors of the commission report include Maurice
Sonnenberg; John Podesta, a White House Deputy Chief of Staff and
also, apparently, a visiting professor at Georgetown
University's Cyberlaw Center; Ellen Hume, a former reporter for the
Wall Street Journal; and Alison Fortier, a former National Security
Council staffer and current Rockwell International employee.

Subject: File 6--UPDATE: Computer Security Script Database

The following is an update to a message posted to CU Digest in recent weeks.

The Banzai Institute - Computer Security Scripts and Software Database
has been a tremendous success.  We currently have over 200 scripts and
programs that can be used to test the security on several types of
systems in many different ways.  As a result of the recent success, we
have decided to lower the price of a subscription to this database.

OLD SUBSCRIPTION    $40.00 per month

NEW SUBSCRIPTION    $25.00 per quarter
       $50.00 per six months, etc...

We at the Banzai Institute believe that site security is a very important
concern. It is for this reason that we have decided to offer this service.
The idea being that the only way to truly know how secure your site is, is
to hack that site like any other hacker would.  We believe that this
database will be very useful in securing your site.  It makes no sense to
pay thousands of dollars for a limited program to check for a limited
number of security holes. We provide the user with a continually growing
list of bug exploits that include and go beyond those provided by most
security auditing software.  We do NOT condone the use of this information
for illegal or illegitimate use.  The database currently contains Sendmail
Bugs And Holes, ICMP Bombs, Sniffer Programs, Keytrap Software, Process
Manipulators, Password Crackers, Spoofers, Login and Process Monitors,
Many root Access Utilities, rdist Tools, passwd file tools, tty Utilities,
rexd, yp, etc...  Exploits, Packet Re-Routers plus Much, Much More!
