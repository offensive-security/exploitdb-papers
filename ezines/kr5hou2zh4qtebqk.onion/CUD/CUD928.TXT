Subject--Suicide, The Net and MCI
Date--Fri, 28 Mar 1997 17:34:55 -0500

When the story on the "Young Web Programmers who committed suicide"
broke, the world was shocked ...

But morbid curiousity would turn into a nightmare for the ISP who
provided domain hosting for the cult, and the netowrk providing THEIR
service. Forty hours after the story broke, thousands of hits per
minute are STILL being recorded at their site. Worse still, the
overwhelming volume slammed the Tennessee DNS provider hosting the
site to the point that MCI's links in the southeast were interrupted
for forty-five minutes shortly after 5PM EST Thursday evening. I
personally suffered some major problems with my provider next door in
Kentucky, who himself was isolated for nearly an hour. Calls to MCI
revealed that they were indeed aware of the problem, and 'taking steps
to correct it'.

The process repeated itself again at 8PM EST when the story hit the
west coast television stations, but the outage only lasted for a few
minutes.  Regardless ... a moderately heavy amount of volume basically
stormed a small DNS provider, and affected MCI's network service in
four adjacent states, proving that the internet is now pretty close to
capacity, and bandwidth upgrades at ALL points are sorely needed.

Big 'boats' like Sun, Microsoft, and the like can readily handle tens
of thousands of hits per minute, but other sites lack even the simple
infrastructure from the communications companies *themselves* to even
stay afloat should everyone rush to one side of 'their ship'.

It is unknown whether any of the people shown above were among those

NS.VALLNET.COM is Valley Internet services in Tennessee, apparently
administrated by Holly Craig (and her husband William) in Dellrose. I
was unable to reach them at their contact number for comment on the
incident, and/or any background info. One thing is certain: their
servers, and MCI will continue to suffer from elevated (morbid) volume
until this thing dies down ...

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The news came over the television here
about 8:00 PM and their reference was to 'late this afternoon in
California' meaning, I would guess, about 4:00 pm, a couple hours
earlier by California time.

Already the sick jokes are starting on this one. Every tragedy has to
have a few sick jokes go along with it, and this one was making the
rounds by fax machine on Friday evening:

Name two major milestones in transportation technology which have
occured in the past five hundred years.

    In 1492, Columbus sailed the blue ...
    In 1997, spaceship rides to Heaven ...

In 1978 at the time of the Jim Jones affair, the jokes dealt with
'Kool Aid Communion'.

The media certainly has messed up this latest story. When they
broke in on the Wheel of Fortune game on ABC with the first
report, it was 'in excess of thirty young men ages 18-24, all
computer web site programmers ...' Later they decided the count
was 39 (which is, admittedly in excess of thirty) but they kept
on saying the ages were 18-24 and all of them were male and that
all were 'internet programmers on the web'. Finally on Saturday
here, they decided that actually 21 were female and 18 were male
and that the ages were middle twenties through (in one case) 72!

Well, I guess they could not have picked a better weekend for it,
this being Easter. Maybe they planned it that way. My wishes for
a happy holiday to those of you who celebrate it.   PAT]

From: RMT <rmt@formal.com>
Subject: File 2--Heaven Gate - A Formal (HTML)  Autopsy

Thirty-nine lives may be a powerful statement, if their deads and
deeds are clear and pure.

This is the judgement of their Form and Substance.

Specifically, by their works, in this case, the tangible results
are 39 dead bodies and some HTML pages.

With an autopsy, it is appropriate "to see" the objects of which
we speak and thus, here is the complete HTML for the "Heaven's
Gate - How and When It May Be Entered" page
at http://www.heavensgate.com/

---html---

The first formal comment regarding this HTML is that
there is *no* convention regarding the formal distinction
between the formal HTML Tags and substantive content of the
document.  Because content may be arbitrarily capitalized,
the optimum convention for facilitating the visual distinction
and recognition between HTML Tags and document content is
to uniformally capitalize the HTML Tags, which are *not*
case sensitive.

And, at a formal level, no DOC HTML Version Tag was included.

So, now we look at the Head of the page and the title is well-formed.
( From this point on, formal comment lines will begin with "***** ". )

<head>

<title>Heaven's Gate - How and When It May Be Entered</title>

***** Okay, these folks are aware of Meta-Tags for facilitating hits
***** and "top-of-the-pile" retreival, hence, more potential customers.
***** The first Meta Tag is for summary descriptions and gives a lot of
***** clues of where these folks are coming from.

<meta name="description" content="How
and When Heaven's Gate, the Door to the Physical Kingdom Level Above
Human,
May Be Entered. Organized Religions Are Killers of Souls. UFOs and
Extraterrestrials - Sorting the Good from the Bad. Final Warning for
Possible Survivors.">

***** Now we get into the keywords and and these folks know how to pack
***** the deck. My favorite reference for how this game of Search Engine
***** registration is at
http://www.digital-cafe.com/~webmaster/set01.html
***** The pure iterative nature of the repetition forces a high score,
***** but is pure formal and represents no additional substance.
***** Cheap, but it works, here and now.

<meta name="keywords" content="Heaven's Gate,

Heaven's Gate, Heaven's Gate, Heaven's Gate, Heaven's Gate, Heaven's

***** Okay, so much for the Head portion.
***** Clearly, these folks understand hexadecimal arithmetic,
***** as they must, in order to even be here. Okay.
***** However, there is a horrible flaw here, in that
***** an attempt to print a hardcopy with this color scheme
***** will produce a very light and bearly readable printed page.
***** This is because text colors are quite dim relative to a
***** pure white background, which is what is used in lieu of
***** printing a complete page of black background.
***** Ironic there their work is dim when transformed from
***** the medium of CyberSpace to the medium of the printed page.

<body bgcolor="#000000" background="img/tile.jpg" text="#33ffcc"
link="#cc99ff" vlink="#66cccc" alink="#ff0066">
<center>

***** This is a *cool* graphic, but the IMG SRC Tag is terrible.

<img src="img/redalrt3.gif" alt="Red Alert --">

***** Failure to include the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes force the
***** browser to wait until the image is downloaded before the
***** browser can lay out the page.  With cut and paste, it is so
***** easy to carry allong all the attributes and turn one the
***** one that are appropriate. It is also a constant reminder
***** of what all the options are. For example:

<IMG SRC = "bitmaps/hr_rnbow.gif"
     BORDER = 0 ALT =  "-------------------------------"
     VSPACE = 0 HSPACE = 0 WIDTH = 585 HEIGHT = 2>

***** is a more complete and useful Tag.

<br>
<font size="6"><font color="#ff0000">HALE-BOPP</font color>
<font color="#66ffff"> Brings Closure to:</font color></font size>

***** Playing with the text colors too much obsecures the hyperlinks.
***** This is slick, but not professional.

<img src="img/hbhgtd.jpg" align=center alt=Welcome to Heaven's Gate>
<a name="top"></a>

***** This is a relative complex table structure.
***** They have a high knowledge of HTML.
***** Note well that HTML is a "Mark Up" set of Tags,
***** and, that HTML is *not* a programming language
***** such as ALGOL, COBOL, PASCAL, or JAVA.

<td><font size=+1>Whether Hale-Bopp has a "companion" or not is
irrelevant from our perspective. However, its arrival is joyously very
significant to us at "Heaven's Gate." The <strong><em>joy</em></strong>
is that our Older Member in the Evolutionary Level Above Human (the
"Kingdom of Heaven") has made it clear to us that Hale-Bopp's approach
is the "marker" we've been waiting for -- the time for the arrival of
the spacecraft from the Level Above Human to take us home to "Their
World" -- in the literal Heavens. Our 22 years of classroom here on
planet Earth is finally coming to conclusion -- "graduation" from the
Human Evolutionary Level. We are happily prepared to leave "this world"
and go with Ti's crew.
<p>
If you study the material on this website you will hopefully understand
our joy and what our purpose here on Earth has been. You may even find
your "boarding pass" to leave with us during this brief "window."

From: Paul Kneisel <tallpaul@nyct.net>
Subject: File 3--"Response to K. Arromdee"

Ken Arromdee's defense of the 200+ news groups in <gov.*> centered on one
generic and one specific psychiatric point, specifically that I (as the
leading <gov.*> critic) am "paranoid" and that I somehow believe that the
creation of the groups is a "sinister government conspiracy" directed
against me personally.[1]

Surely the supporters of the 200+ <gov.*> new groups can do better than this!

I believe that Arromdee's personal attack is consistent with the past
approach of the Old Boys Club on Usenet, which is increasingly becoming
irrelevant as the Internet expands. John C. Dvorak of _PC Magazine_ has
described these long-time net residents as the "Newsgroup Charlies" who are
increasingly damaging meaningful discourse on the net with their
unsubstantial charges and off-topic claims. "There is a certain air to
these messages," Dvorak wrote,  "as though they'd been written by someone
knowledgable. Unfortunately, it's really the air of authority without any
experience necessarily behind it. And guys like Newsgroup Charlies are
quick to flame others."[2]

In this sense then, I invite him to further develop the analysis he wants
the world to believe. I think it involves three points:

1) He should explain to everyone the education and training that qualifies
him to psychiatrically label those with whom he disagrees politically;

2) He should present the facts observable to the classical "reasonable man
[and woman]" that I am "paranoid" and that justify his conclusion that I
believe that <gov.*> is a "sinister government conspiracy" against me
personally, and;

3) He should explain what possible relevance such psychiatric
material--even if true--has on the real political issues in this case. In
other words, let us imagine that I posted to CuDigest from a hacked
computer inside Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital where I imagine I am the
Queen of England and Napoleon rolled into one. Would this change a single
thing about the nature of <gov.*> or the issues involved in its creation
and functioning?

I think that we will soon discover an additional three points: that
Arromdee has no qualifications behind his claims, that he has no data of
any sort to back his claim that I believe that <gov.*> was aimed at me
personally, and that his whole approach is nothing more than the classic
"Good Ol' Boy" flamefest aimed at critics of the Old Boys (Inter) Network
to suppress rather than expand the political debate.

The issue of "info-warfare" and its economic consequences and purposes is
not new. It existed long before the Internet. The only two basic changes
are that with the demise of the former Soviet Union it is done far more
openly and now--via developments like <gov.*>--it can use the net as a form
of transmission.

The first of these developments is advocated by such conservative thinkers
as Walter Laqueur who wrote in his article "Postmodern Terrorism" that
"America should pursue a vision of benevolent hegemony as bold as Reagan's
in the 1970s and wield its authority unabashedly."[3]

Elsewhere, Joseph S. Nye, Jr. and Admiral WIlliam Owens wrote how the
Internet could be incorporated into this process as part of an
international "soft power" strategy.[4]

One need not be paranoid to note this. The _New York Times_ printed the
early pre-net history of such federal info-interventions on its 31 March
front page.[5]

"Congress routinely appropriates tens of millions of dollars in covert and
overt money to use in influencing domestic politics abroad," Broder wrote.
"The National Endowment for Democracy, created 15 years ago to do in the
open what the C.I.A. has done surreptitiously for decades, spends $30
million a year to support things like political parties, labor unions,
dissident movements and the news media in dozens of countries, including
China."

Later in the story, Broder provided a figure of "countless billions [not
millions]" on such acts as "secret support for political parties of close
allies like Japan, fomenting coups, spreading false rumors, and swaying
public opinion."

Why shouldn't the net be used for such things, especially with so many
academics and Pentagon-thinkers advocating exactly this.

So, paranoid? Perhaps so, but then so are the editors of the _Times_. In
one sense, the editors are even more paranoid than I.

I only posted my material to <news.groups> and CuDigest. They posted theirs
to the front page of the _The New York Times_.

Nye had earlier defined "soft power" in his book _Bound to Lead: The
Changing Nature of Power in America_ as: "the ability to achieve desired
outcomes in international affairs through attraction rather than coercion.
It works by convincing others to follow, or getting them to agree to, norms
and institutions that produce the desired behavior. Soft power can rest on
the appeal of one's ideas or the ability to set the agenda in ways that
shape the preferences of others. If a state can make its power legitimate
in the perception of others and establish international institutions that
encourage them to channel or limit their activities, it may not need to
expend as many of its costly traditional economic or military resources."
