CA-91:04                       CERT Advisory
                               April 18, 1991
                 Social Engineering

DESCRIPTION:

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received several incident reports concerning users receiving requests
to take an action that results in the capturing of their password.
The request could come in the form of an e-mail message, a broadcast,
or a telephone call.  The latest ploy instructs the user to run a
"test" program, previously installed by the intruder, which will
prompt the user for his or her password.  When the user executes the
program, the user's name and password are e-mailed to a remote site.
We are including an example message at the end of this advisory.

These messages can appear to be from a site administrator or root.  In
reality, they may have been sent by an individual at a remote site,
who is trying to gain access or additional access to the local machine
via the user's account.

While this advisory may seem very trivial to some experienced users,
the fact remains that MANY users have fallen for these tricks (refer
to CERT Advisory CA-91:03).

IMPACT:

An intruder can gain access to a system through the unauthorized use
of the (possibly privileged) accounts whose passwords have been
compromised.  This problem could affect all systems, not just UNIX
systems or systems on the Internet.

SOLUTION:

The CERT/CC recommends the following actions:

    1)  Any users receiving such a request should verify its
        authenticity with their system administrator before acting on
        the instructions within the message.  If a user has received
        this type of request and actually entered a password, he/she
        should immediately change his/her password to a new one and
        alert the system administrator.

    2)  System administrators should check with their user communities
        to ensure that no user has followed the instructions in such a
        message. Further, the system should be carefully examined for
        damage or changes that the intruder may have caused.  We also
        ask that you contact the CERT/CC.

    3)  The CERT/CC urges system administrators to educate their users
        so that they will not fall prey to such tricks.

SAMPLE MESSAGE as received by the CERT (including spelling errors,
etc.)

     OmniCore is experimenting in online - high resolution graphics
     display on the UNIX BSD 4.3 system and it's derivatives [sic].
     But, we need you're help in testing our new product -
     TurboTetris.  So, if you are not to busy, please try out the
     ttetris game in your machine's /tmp directory. just type:

     /tmp/ttetris

     Because of the graphics handling and screen-reinitialization
     [sic], you will be prompted to log on again. Please do so, and
     use your real password.  Thanks you for your support. You'll be
     hearing from us soon!
