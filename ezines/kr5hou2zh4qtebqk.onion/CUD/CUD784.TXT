Subject: File 1--CuD Goof "cancels" CuD 7.83 (e-oops)

A too-hasty return key deleted CuD 7.83 from Usenet Tuesday.  Rather
than re-send this close to #7.84, we simply point readers to the CuD
http site at: http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest

Those receiving CuD on the mailing list were unaffected.

The issue emphasized Spam artists, and detailed Telecom Digest
editor Pat Townson's successful tracking down of spammeister "Spam
King" and a few others. Pat did a great job, and we encourage
readers to take a look at it.

We apologize for the goof, and we will dock Etian Shrdlu's pay.

Subject: File 2--Retort to: Attention Spammer: The War Has Started

I would like to retort Patrick Townson's comments. I don't believe
methods are the best.  Think about it.  They  are spamming the usenet.
What do we do?  We screw the bank account or leave messages on his
voicemail.  Are we being any better?

Also you have to take a look at the legal issue.  Ok..You have his bank
account number.  What are you going to do?  Forge checks?  That is a
crime. Where are spamming the newgroups (contrary to popular oppion) is
not a legal crime.

Please, I know how much spamming bothers me, but lets not revert down to
their level.  E-mailing Admins expressing concern (when you know who did
it.) is a good option.  For those you don't know..LET the USENET admin
deal with it.  For ever spam that occurs on UseNet I swear there is at
least 10% to 20%  MORE bandwidth WASTED  on flames and bitchings on
UseNet itself.   Unknown how much E-mail (if it's  a valid address) are
sent.

To save yourself from hell and damnation of the law, don't even think about
getting back at spammers via illegal actives (as the letter Mr. Townson
presented).

ANNOUNCEMENTS

The "bill-monitoring" section of BillWatch will be omitted for the next
few issues, since very little legislation related to VTW's issues seems
to be moving through the process.  The only exception is the Telecomm
Deregulation Act, which is moving, but in conference committee.  As you
probably know, this is not a process which is easily monitored by the public,
so there aren't the same sorts of checkpoints as one is used to with the
standard committee-hearing-vote-chamber-debate-vote process.

In this issue we bring you three offerings:

-a profile of the conference committee that has Internet regulation in front
 of it,
-a letter to the editor of Hemispheres, an airline magazine, and
-the final tally of companies and bulletin boards signed onto the business
 and BBS "letter to Congress opposing net censorship"

Note that the bill status section will be back soon, as soon as we have
compressed it to cram the most information into the fewest characters
possible.  At BillWatch, our aim is to be as compact as possible while
being your most informative source of legislative and policy information.

PROFILE OF THE TELECOMM BILL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE (NET FREE SPEECH FOCUS)

It's been a busy year.  First Amendment advocates have seen four different
pieces of legislation regulating free speech on public networks attach
themselves to the Telecommunications bill and proceed into the conference
committee.  They are:

HR1978: "Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act" (Cox/Wyden) This
bill takes the approach of encouraging industry to provide parents with
tools to restrict their childrens' access to the net.  It contains no
new criminal provisions.  This approach was affirmed by the House
421-4 on August 4, 1995.  (Yes, that's a landslide)

S314: "The Communications Decency Act" (Exon/Coats) This bill makes
many types of constitutionally-protected speech (including lewd,
lascivious, and indecent speech) criminal when used through a
telecommunications device.  This provision was affirmed by the Senate
84-16 on June 14, 1995.

House amendment to HR1555: "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Act" (Klink/Leahy) This bill
directs the Department of Justice to study and see if there are places
in current law where existing obscenity laws are unenforcible on computer
networks.  This approach was affirmed by a committee voice vote on May 24,
1995.

House amendment to HR1555: <unnamed>  This amendment was submitted at
the last minute through the Manager's Mark, a collection of several
amendments to HR1555 that were voted on as a block on Aug 4, 1995.  This
amendment takes constitutionally-protected speech and criminalizes it when
it is expressed online.  Most legislators had no idea that they voted on
this last amendment; the summary of the Manager's Mark did not mention
these new criminal provisions.  There was no applicable House vote on
*just this* provision.

Once into conference, free speech activists began to examine who would
end up on the conference committee.  Several draft lists have been
circulated previously in other publications.  Here is the latest list
that was read on the House floor.  We have included below a tally of how
each member voted, if they were a co-sponsor of the Cox/Wyden bill, and
if they spoke on net censorship during the Telecomm bill debate.  Most
of this information was gleaned from a previous issue of BillWatch,
BillWatch #13 (http://www.vtw.org/billwatch/issue.13).


Y = voted or spoke in support of free speech on the net (HR1978)
N = voted or spoke in opposition to free speech on the net  (HR1978)
A = did not vote or chose not to speak on the issue
(a blank implies an A)

Totals
33 Representatives on the Conference Committee
33 of them voted in favor of the Cox/Wyden Internet Freedom bill in a
   recorded vote
 1 Representative who sponsored the Cox/Wyden bill - White (R-WA)
 5 Representatives who stood up and spoke in favor of the Cox/Wyden bill
   during the floor debate on the Telecomm bill


These are encouraging numbers.  Note that I checked for cosponsors of
other free-speech related bills, or floor debates where one of these members
might have spoken up on the issue either for or against, and found nothing
relevant.
Now let's take a look at the Senate side where the story gets a little grim.


Y = voted or spoke in favor of censorship (S314)
N = voted or spoke in opposition to censorship (S314)
A = did not vote or chose not to speak on the issue
(a blank implies an A)

                Vote      S314   Spoke at
Senator         S314    sponsor? debate?
  ------        ----    -------- --------

Exon (D)         Y         Y       Y
Ford (D)         Y
Gorton (R)       Y         Y
Hollings (D)     Y
Inouye (D)       Y
Lott (R)         Y
McCain (R)       Y
Pressler (R)     Y
Rockefeller (D)  Y
Stevens (R)      Y


Totals
11 Senators on the Conference Committee
11 Senators voted in favor of the Exon/Gorton Internet Censorship bill (S314)
 2 Senators who sponsored the Exon/Gorton bill - Exon (D-NE), Gorton (R-WA)
 1 Senator who stood up and spoke in favor of the Exon/Gorton bill
   during the floor debate


As you can see, these numbers for the Senate are not so encouraging.  There
are two things that you need to know when looking at this chart.  First,
not all members of Congress are allowed to work on all parts of the bill.
The section which contains the net censorship language may be weighted
evenly with Representatives and Senators, which would make those that oppose
net censorship evenly matched (11 to 11) with those that previously voted
in favor.

Secondly, support in the Senate for the Exon/Gorton bill is weak.  There was
a perceivable amount of rumbling about the bill after the vote, so
it wouldn't be surprising to see some of the Senators that previously voted
in favor of the Exon bill to change their position once in the confines of the
conference committee.

On the House side, support for the Cox/Wyden bill was strong and is not
expected to wane at all.  Although Reps. Cox and Wyden are not on the
conference committee, there is one cosponsor and five supportors present.
It is likely that at least one of these people will choose to continue to
support this issue once the committee begins its deliberations.

VTW will continue to monitor the conference committee process and bring
you news as soon as we get it.

LETTER TO HEMISPHERES MAGAZINE FROM MARK ECKENWILER

VTW has long been a fan of Mark Eckenwiler's work.  Apparently Mark's
flying a lot these days, and was irked by an editorial in United Airlines'
airborne print totem, Hemispheres.

VTW encourages you to write a letter to the editor whenever you see
incorrect information about the Internet being portrayed.  If you do,
send a copy to vtw@vtw.org and we'll publish the best ones.

Thanks Mark, for letting us publish your letter, and for setting United
Airlines straight on the status of speech on the Internet.

Letters
Hemispheres
1301 Carolina St.
Greensboro, NC 27401
hmsphrlet@aol.com

To the Editor:

     In "Surf's Up" (Oct. 1995), Montieth Illingworth glibly
endorses proposed federal legislation to regulate pornography on
the Internet by saying that "some loss of liberty is . . . the
price to pay for protecting those who can't protect themselves
[i.e., children]."  Mr. Illingworth is wrong for three reasons.

     First, there are already federal and state laws barring the
transmission of obscene materials.  (Bear in mind, however, that
the First Amendment protects even pornography so long as it is not
legally obscene.)

     Second, the legislation now before Congress would not merely
impose "some loss of liberty"; on the contrary, it would reduce the
Internet to a children's library.  As the U.S. Supreme Court said
so colorfully forty years ago in striking down a similar law,
banning all adult materials to protect children would be "burning
the house to roast the pig."

     Finally, Mr. Illingworth mistakenly implies that the only way
to protect children is by passing laws.  As the father of two young
boys, I suggest that he consult the word "parent" in his
dictionary; it is a verb as well as a noun.

Sincerely,

Mark Eckenwiler

<HR>

Welcome to the Cybercop Home Page on the WELL.<P>

My name is Kevin Manson. Professionally, I teach cybercops
to obey the law as they enforce it. Personally, I am a Net
traveller and explorer who calls a number of 'places' on the
Matrix, like the WELL, home. I'm a converted Mac user,
member of the Internet Society and EFF. In the "real
world" I drive a 10 year old Toyota, in the virtual world
I cruise about in the latest model of Netscape.<P>

Two years ago I developed the first BBS and pioneered
Internet training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center (FLETC), where I serve as a Senior Instructor in
the Legal Division. FLETC is located 70 miles north of
Jacksonville, Florida on the Georgia coast.<P>

Bruce Sterling wrote about FLETC in his cyber-classic
"The Hacker Crackdown...Law and Disorder on the Electronic
Frontier" and the Center was featured in a January 23,
1995 cover story in US News & World Report written by
Senior Editor Vic Sussman.<P>

As we WELLbeings know, this community typically "polices"
itself, so I've set up a "community relations" cybercop
substation where defining issues regarding "policing
cyberspace" can be disseminated and links can be made
to other significant Internet sites where cyberlaw issues
are catalogued. <P>

We're the Cyber-Dunkin' Doughnuts in this little community
on the Net. Come on in, grab a cup of Hot Java, pick up that
rumpled-up 'zine' in the booth next to you, and catch up on
some cyberlaw news.<P>

If you are not familiar with the eclectic community that
resides here on the WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link), you
owe it to yourself to stroll about a bit on the WELL gopher
or check out <A HREF = "http://www.well.com/user/hlr/">
Howard Rheingold's home page</A> for a run down on this
small town on the Net that has garnered so much attention.
<P>

"The Hacker Crackdown" serves as a paradigm for this Web
Site. Bruce Sterling mailed me my first issue of <A
HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/Signal/Surf//">WIRED
magazine</A> two years ago (WIRED'S premier issue) and
cyberspace hasn't looked the same since.<P>

Yes, you'll find Netcop views here, but in the context of
the diverse views of civil libertarians, hackers,
journalists, academicians and industry leaders. Vic
Sussman's critically acclaimed January 23rd <A HREF =
"http://www.well.com:80:/user/kfarrand/usnews1.htm">
US News & World Report cover story</A> on "Policing
Cyberspace", which provides a compact overview of the
many complex issues surrounding law on the digital
frontier that will be covered here.<P>

I'm fortunate that WELLhelpers like David Gans, Matisse
Enzor and many other WELL volunteers have generously
shared their extensive knowledge about navigating about
on the WELL and I'd like to thank them for their on-line
help. The WELL community service of live on-line help
from WELL volunteers is one of the amenities of 'living'
in this community.<P>

One interesting site is found on <A HREF = "http://
www.phantom.com:80/">Mindvox</A>. Started
by Kim Clancy, the "Round Table" Forum  brings together
journalists, law enforcement, civil libertarians, and
many others who are interested in issues related to
freedom, security and privacy in cyberspace. Check out
Mindvox for a Gotham slant on the Net. You'll need to
join the 'Vox' to get on the Round Table.<P>

Dorothy Denning, professor of Computer Science at
Georgetown, has written extensively on crypto subjects.
When Dorothy was with Digital Equipment Corporation
she wrote an interesting <A HREF = "http://
www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/hackers/
Hackers-NCSC.txt/">piece on the need to open a dialog
with hackers.</A>Dorothy mailed me the June 11, 1995
<A HREF = "http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/
hackers/Hackers-Postscript.txt/">"postscript"</A>
to this three year old piece - with a different "take"
on the subject. Dorothy maintains a home crypto page
at <A HREF = "http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning
/crypto/">ttp://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/
crypto/Crime-and-Crypto.txt</A> (Article on Crime &
Crypto on the Information Superhighway) The term
"hacker" has gathered much baggage and deserves its
own serious discussion here in the near future.<P>

Public cryptography has become the proverbial "two
edged sword" that concurrently serves as a talisman
of freedom, anarchy, security, privacy and anonymity.
Cryptography has become a defining "boundary issue"
separating the hacker, civil libertarian and law
enforcement communities. Phil Zimmerman, has
become the point man (or lightening rod, depending
on one's perspective) of public key cryptography which
aids the public citizen and terrorist with equal facility.
I met Phil at the FLETC where he gave a presentation
earlier this year. Mike Godwin has also trekked to our
training facility to present the views of the "loyal
opposition" to  cybercops in training.<P>

Secure transmission of data on the Net is only part
of the challenge presented to commerce as that data
becomes a vessel for the fuel of commerce. Digital
cash is now a reality. As Bruce Sterling penned in a
message to me
<A HREF = "http://www.well.com:80/user/kfarrand/digicash">
"Oh dear--call IRS"</A><P>

Without robust debate and communications about
these issues across a round table, the essential
element of trust of a community in its agents tasked
with preserving security cannot be created or
maintained. To that end I have dedicated this Web
site.<P>

The concept of scenario planning, so successfully
practiced by the digital heavy hitter futurists of
the Global Business Network (who have an address
here on the WELL), challenges us to manage change
rather than being passively swept up by it.<P>

Respected police futurist, Bill Tafoya, was instrumental
in bringing investigations like the UNABOMB case to the
public's attention on the Net. Larry Coutorie, who is
with the University of Texas System and the HTCIA,
has produced a
<A HREF = "http://www.well.com:80/user/kfarrand/COUTORIE.TXT">
Delphi Study</A> of High Tech Crime that "attempts to
forecast the future nature of high-technology crime"<P>

The administration's cut on the future government
involvement in this red-shift technology target is found
in its recent "
<A HREF = "http://www.well.com:80/user/kfarrand/FEDROLE.TXT">
NII Security: The Federal Role</A>"<P>

Protecting children from "adult content" on the Internet
is one of the most important challenges for our nation
and the Net community. Will a workable solution come
from the  Federal Government via legislative fiat or
from empowered families? Take a look at a very
interesting product from SurfWatch (www.surfwatch.
com/index.html/) regarding the latter approach, and
<A HREF = "http://www.cdt.org/">The Communications
Decency Act</A> as to the former. The fear of parents
is real and new software solutions are appearing on
the horizon. Solid Oak Software of Santa Barbara
recently released its CYBERsitter that blocks on-line
and disk access. I would imagine it's only a matter of
ime before some enterprising programmer will reverse
engineer a product that will hone in on the very content
these products are seeking to block.<P>
