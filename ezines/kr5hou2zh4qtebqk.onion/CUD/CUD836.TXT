(1) Court Orders DOJ to Halt "Reviews" Under the CDA

In response to a complaint filed last week by the CIEC, a Federal Judge in
Philadelphia Wednesday ordered the Justice Department to stop all "reviews"
of complaints under the Communications Decency Act until the three-judge
panel rules on the constitutionality of the law.   The order was issued by
Judge Stewart Dalzell, one of the three judges presiding over the case.

CIEC and ACLU attorneys filed the compliant after several national
newspapers reported last week that the FBI had opened an investigation of
Compuserve for violations of the CDA.  The FBI has since denied that any
investigation is or was underway, though the stories sparked a great deal
of confusion and created a significant public relations problem for the
commercial online service.

In the order Judge Dalzell stated that "the government's conduct in
subjecting a content provider to private and public scrutiny for displaying
material that is neither obscene nor child pornography clearly runs afoul
of both this Court's orders and the government's promises."

Closing arguments in the case concluded on Friday May 10, and a final
decision on the constitutionality of the CDA is expected soon.  While
Wednesday's ruling by Judge Dalzell provides little insight into which way
the court will rule on the constitutionality of the CDA, the speed with
which the order was issued does show that the court appreciates the
tremendous free speech and commercial concerns riding on this case.

The full text of the seven page order, tramscripts from Friday's oral
arguments, and with other relevant information, is available at the
Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition web page:

  http://www.cdt.org/ciec

BACKGROUND ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT/AFA FOLLIES

After a Philadelphia federal judge granted a temporary restraining order
against the CDA in February, the government agreed not to prosecute or
investigate anyone for violations of the CDA until the court challenge had
been completed.   However, recent events have called the government's
commitment to the February agreement into question.

In early April, the conservative American Family Association (AFA) filed a
complaint with the Justice Department accusing Compuserve of violating the
CDA for material in a forum called MacGlamour, despite the fact that the
site was labeled for adults only and Compuserve provides its users free
software to block access to unwanted material.

Last week in response to pressure from the AFA, acting Chief of the DOJ
Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section Terry Lord sent a letter to AFA
director Patrick Truman indicating that the Department "has referred [the
AFA] letter and accompanying materials to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for further review."

The FBI denied it was investigating, which would have been a violation of
the February court agreement, but said it was "reviewing" the AFA
complaint.  CIEC attorneys asked the court to clarify if such a "review"
violated the government's promise not to investigate or prosecute under the
CDA.

In granting the motion for clarification, Judge Dalzell ordered Attorney
General Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI to stop all "reviews" of
online indecency complaints pending a decision regarding the
constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act.

Subject: File 2--LAWSUIT: Dalzell's Court Order

My apologies to one and all for yesterday's failed attempts to update
you on Judge Dalzell's court order reaffirming the injunction that
blocks the DoJ from "reviewing" potentially "indecent" violations of
the Communications Decency Act.

Many thanks to all those who alerted me to the problem of the
mysteriously truncated messages.  Such are the perils of life in this
technological age.

In compensation -- and in the true spirit of open government -- I'm
passing along some highlights of Judge Dalzell's order.  It's a
powerful document that is worth getting to know.

After all, for the time being, this text is our only bulwark against
the censor-happy thugs from the American Family Association and their
eager accomplices at the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Division of
the U.S. Department of Justice.

( ... Assuming, of course, that this message doesn't get truncated
too.)

Work the network!

JUSTICE, et al.                  :  NO. 96-1458

ORDER

AND NOW, this 15th day of May, 1996, upon consideration of
plaintiffs' Motion to Clarify and Restate the Court's Orders
Concerning Defendants' Actions Pending Resolution of Plaintiffs'
Motions for Preliminary Relief, and the response of the Government
thereto, and the Court finding that:

(a) On February 15, 1996 this Court entered a Temporary Restraining
Order enjoining "[t]he defendant, her agents, and her servants . . .
from enforcing against plaintiffs the provisions of 47 U.S.C.
223(a) (1) (B) (ii), insofar as they extend to 'indecent,' but not
'obscene'" Internet content, see docket no. 14;

(b) Thereafter, the parties entered a stipulation in which the
Attorney General promised that "she will not initiate any
investigations or prosecutions for violations of 47 U.S.C.  223(d)
for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision until
the three-judge court hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary
Injunction... and has decided the motion" see docket no. 18;(1)

(c) This Court approved the Stipulation on February 26, 1996,
giving it the force of an Order of this Court;

[ DELETED SECTION (A chronology of the AFA's dispute with CompuServe) ]

(j) The plaintiffs in C.A. No. 96-1458 have now moved this court
for an Order to clarify the February 15th Temporary Restraining
Order and the February 26th Stipulation and Order to prevent the
Department of Justice from "reviewing" Internet Content that falls
within the scope of the prohibitions in those two Orders;

(k) In its written response to the motion, the Government has
emphasized that the Attorney General retains her full discretion to
prosecute the CDA as it relates to obscenity and child pornography,
see defs.' resp. at 5-6;

(l) The Government echoed these arguments at oral argument on May
10, 1996, see Transcript of May 10, 1996 at 150, 154-55;

(m) Although the Government is correct about the Attorney General's
continued discretion under the obscenity and child pornography
provisions of the CDA, this point misses the mark entirely, for the
following reasons:

i. Under the Government's view of this case, nude depictions of
sexual organs alone are almost certainly not obscene,

[ ... ]

ii. The women in the photographs are almost certainly not minors;

iii. At most, then, the Government has initiated a "review" of
CompuServe purportedly for obscenity and child pornography based
only on the availability of indecent material there;

(n) Thus, neither actual obscenity nor child pornography provided
the impetus for the Department of Justice's referral of CompuServe
for "review" by the FBI;

(o) Notwithstanding the Government's post hoc rationalization for
the actions of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Division,
its conduct in subjecting a content provider to private and public
scrutiny for displaying material that is neither obscene nor child
pornography clearly runs afoul of both this Court's Orders and the
Government's promises, as made in the Stipulation we approved on
February 26, 1996;

It is hereby ORDERED that:

1. Plaintiffs' Motion to Clarify and Restate the Court's Orders
Concerning Defendants' Actions Pending Resolution of Plaintiffs'
Motions for Preliminary Relief is GRANTED;

2. "Review" by the Attorney General or her agents, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, of sexually oriented Internet
content falls within this Court's Temporary Restraining Order of
February 15, 1996 and the Stipulation this Court approved by Order
on February 26, 1996, when that "review" is triggered by (1)
content that is neither obscene nor child pornography, or (2)
complaints of Internet content that, as described, constitute
neither obscenity nor child pornography;

3. The Attorney General and her agents are ENJOINED from engaging
in "review" of a content provider if that "review" is triggered by
either of the two circumstances described in paragraph two of this
Order; and

4. The Attorney General and her agents retain their full power to
"review" complaints regarding Internet content that constitutes
obscenity or child pornography, provided that, if, upon "review" it
appears that the material complained of is neither obscene or child
pornography, the "review" must then immediately cease.

Subject: File 3--Letter From Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) On Encryption

     Please post where appropriate

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

     LETTER FROM SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON ENCRYPTION

May 2, 1996

Dear Friends:

Today, a bipartisan group of Senators has joined me in supporting
legislation to encourage the development and use of strong,
privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet by rolling back
the out-dated restrictions on the export of strong cryptography.

In an effort to demonstrate one of the more practical uses of
encryption technology (and so that you all know this message
actually came from me), I have signed this message using a
digital signature generated by the popular encryption program
PGP.  I am proud to be the first member of Congress to utilize
encryption and digital signatures to post a message to the
Internet.

As a fellow Internet user, I care deeply about protecting
individual privacy and encouraging the development of the Net as
a secure and trusted communications medium.  I do not need to
tell you that current export restrictions only allow American
companies to export primarily weak encryption technology.  The
current strength of encryption the U.S. government will allow out
of the country is so weak that, according to a January 1996 study
conducted by world-renowned cryptographers, a pedestrian hacker
can crack the codes in a matter of hours!  A foreign intelligence
agency can crack the current 40-bit codes in seconds.

Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet and
similar interactive communications technologies by Americans to
obtain critical medical services, to conduct business, to be
entertained and communicate with their friends, raises special
concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of those
communications.  I have long been concerned about these issues,
and have worked over the past decade to protect privacy and
security for our wire and electronic communications.  Encryption
technology provides an effective way to ensure that only the
people we choose can read our communications.

I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet about how
human rights groups in the Balkans have had their computers
confiscated during raids by security police seeking to find out
the identities of people who have complained about abuses.
Thanks to PGP, the encrypted files were undecipherable by the
police and the names of the people who entrusted their lives to
the human rights groups were safe.

The new bill, called the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the
Digital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996," would:

     o    bar any government-mandated use of any particular
     encryption system, including key escrow systems and affirm
     the right of American citizens to use whatever form of
     encryption they choose domestically;

     o    loosen export restrictions on encryption products so
     that American companies are able to export any generally
     available or mass market encryption products without
     obtaining government approval; and

     o    limit the authority of the federal government to set
     standards for encryption products used by businesses and
     individuals, particularly standards which result in products
     with limited key lengths and key escrow.

This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with Senator
Burns and other congressional colleagues this year. Both bills
call for an overhaul of this country's export restrictions on
encryption, and, if enacted, would quickly result in the
widespread availability of strong, privacy protecting
technologies. Both bills also prohibit a government-mandated key
escrow encryption system.  While PRO-CODE would limit the
authority of the Commerce Department to set encryption standards
for use by private individuals and businesses, the first bill we
introduced, called the "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act",
S.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement to
follow to obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to read
the plaintext of encrypted communications obtained under court
order or other lawful process.

It is clear that the current policy towards encryption exports is
hopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs of
individuals and businesses in the global marketplace.  Encryption
expert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted that current
U.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption are
having a "deleterious effect ... on our country's ability to
develop a reliable and trustworthy information infrastructure."
The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our national
encryption policy on the right course.

I am looking forward to hearing from you on this important issue.
Throughout the course of the recent debate on the Communications
Decency Act, the input from Internet users was very valuable to
me and some of my Senate colleagues.

You can find out more about the issue at my World Wide Web home
page (http://www.leahy.senate.gov/) and at the Encryption Policy
Resource Page (http://www.crypto.com/). Over the coming months, I
look forward to the help of the Net community in convincing other
Members of Congress and the Administration of the need to reform
our nation's cryptography policy.

Sincerely,

Patrick Leahy
United States Senator

From: anonymous@netcom.com
Subject: File 4--Remaining Scientology Secret Scriptures Posted to Usenet

In article <noringDr3F19.1M1@netcom.com you write:

[Carefully note that followup discussion has been set to the
newsgroups alt.religion.scientology and comp.org.eff.talk, so
subscribe accordingly if you are at all interested in following this
thread.]


Last last week, a series of anonymous postings were made to the
Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology.  Contained in these
postings were the complete NOTS materials (NEDs for OTs), the last
remaining, and highest level, secret materials ("scriptures") of the
Church of Scientology (CoS).

Late last year, the OT materials, a related set of high-level secret
"scriptures" were similarly posted to Usenet.  This action destroyed
what was left of CoS' claims the OT materials were "trade secret" and
may have cast doubt on the validity of the copyrights to some of
them.  Copies of the Fishman affidavit, a Federal court document
which includes the OT materials as exhibits, can be read via several
Web sites in the Netherlands, where the Dutch courts ruled earlier
this year the Fishman affidavit could be maintained on Web pages
there.  The court ruling is being appealed by CoS and even if CoS
gets the ruling overturned (unlikely), the trade secret status of the
OT materials is all but lost, with ramifications for ongoing
litigation here in the U.S. between CoS and several critics.

The NOTS are considered even higher level than the OT materials, and
CoS has gone through extraordinary lengths to try to suppress their
dissemination on the Internet.  In the last few months, Ms. Helena
Kobrin, a Scientology attorney representing the Religious Technology
Center, who defends the intellectual property rights to all the AT
("Advanced Technology") materials for the owner, the Church of
Spiritual Technology, legally threatened any person who simply posted
a *request* to purchase a *legal* copy of the NOTS materials!  Her
threats enraged the Internet community, and probably led someone who
happened to possess the NOTS to scan and anonymously post them in
order to end the egregious and unwarranted harassment of ordinary
users.

What is interesting about both the OT and the NOTS materials is that
they are, as a whole, quite boring, even though there are a few
glimmers of "excitement" here and there, such as in OT3 which depicts
a "space opera" (Xenu, the Marcabs, hydrogen bombs, etc.) and in the
OT8 (which CoS disputes is a forgery) which says that Jesus was a
pederast.  However, the value of these materials to CoS is obviously
monetary;  for a person to advance to these levels requires them
paying hundreds of thousands of dollars or serving as a slave to the
organization for many years.  This is in contradiction to nearly all
legitimate religions which essentially teach their spiritual "truths"
for free or for a very nominal fee to cover expenses.  The
ramifications to CoS are obvious if their "secret" AT materials are
disseminated and commented upon in public.

Thus, it is clear by CoS' actions, as well as comments from former
high-level Scientologists, that (from CoS' perspective) the posting
of the NOTS is a disaster of the first magnitude, comparable to the
impact on the tobacco industry by the recent leak of the "tobacco
papers", and the impact on the Federal Government by the leak of the
"Pentagon papers" during the Vietnam War.

Following the posting of the NOTS, the infamous "CancelBunny"
appeared, a throwaway account at Netcom used to cancel the NOTS posts
(such cancellation is probably a violation of Federal Law).  Thus,
the NOTS postings have been cancelled and are no longer available at
many sites except at those sites which do not honor cancels.
However, if past experience with the OT levels is any indication, the
NOTS might be reposted over and over again to minimize the actions of
the "CancelBunny."  No doubt tens of thousands of copies of the NOTS
have already been downloaded and are sitting on computers all around
the world.  Pandora's box has been opened and public access and
commentary of the NOTS in the public interest can no longer be
stifled.

The next few days and weeks should be watched very closely.  It has
been predicted that the anonymous remailers in the Netherlands
(through which the NOTS were posted) may be put under extraordinary
legal pressure to try to shut them down since they are the easiest
means for a person to anonymously repost the NOTS (which CoS is
deathly afraid of).  Also look for CoS to get a court order to access
the logs/records for all anonymous remailers in the U.S. in the hope
(a long shot at best) of finding the person who posted the NOTS (they
may have used a chain of remailers to post the NOTS), and possibly to
help with discovery in other related litigation they are now involved
in.  Another benefit of such a court order is that it simply puts
more pressure on anonymous remailers, and may cause many of them to
simply "throw in the towel."

It's also been suggested that CoS may accelerate their
long-anticipated filing of a RICO suit against scores of net.critics,
attornies, journalists (such as Leiby at the Washington Post) and
other non-net.critics.  The hope behind this RICO suit, which will
ultimately fail since it has absolutely no merit, is that it will
shut down, even if temporarily, critical discussion of CoS on the
Internet.  CoS has shown themselves by their actions to be a paranoid
and schizophrenic organization who cannot tolerate or ignore even one
word of criticism.

I urge everybody reading this post to become familiar with what is
occuring and to keep a close eye on events.  Ron Newman maintains a
wonderful Web page describing what's happened in the Scientology vs.
Internet war in the last 18 months, and has links to many other
sites, including Scientology's (while Scientology refuses to link to
Ron's page in a show of good faith).  It will give a good background
as to what is currently happening.  The URL to Ron's page is:
http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html

The integrity of the anonymous remailers, an important component of
cyber liberties, is being gravely threatened.  And many people on the
Internet who are exercising their Freedom of Speech to comment and
criticize the Church of Scientology may come under severe attack --
if CoS can get away with this, then other groups who also cannot
tolerate any criticism or public exposure will be encouraged to
follow in CoS' footsteps, with grave ramifications to the integrity
of our net.freedoms.

I urge the Internet community to closely monitor the unfolding events
and to become active should CoS overstep the bounds of accepted
decency and attempt to bully their way around the Internet.  Read
Ron's Web page, read the Usenet newsgroup 'alt.religion.scientology'.
Become involved!

Subject: File 6--Judge Denies Bond to Accused Hacker


JUDGE DENIES BON TO ACCUSED HACKER
St. Louis Post Dispatch (SL) - Saturday, April 6, 1996
By: Tim Bryant Of The Post-Dispatch Staff

After another prisoner said accused computer hacker Christopher
Schanot was planning a quick escape from his parents' home near High
Ridge, a federal magistrate decided Friday to keep Schanot in jail.

Schanot was close to being released on bond when the prisoner told
his story. In computer lingo, that kind of bad luck is called a
crash.

                           ..................

Releasing Schanot, 19, under even the most stringent conditions
would be "very risky," ruled U.S. Magistrate Judge Lawrence Davis.
The judge ordered that Schanot remain in custody pending trial, set
to begin June 10.

Schanot's lawyer, federal public defender Norm London, told Davis
that the alleged conversation between the young man and Esposito
never happened.

Schanot had been close to release on $150,000 bond earlier Friday.
That was before Esposito told his lawyer about a conversation he
said he had with Schanot on Thursday night in the jail in Jennings.

                           ..................

Esposito testified that after he asked Schanot about his bond
hearing Thursday, Schanot replied that he planned to stay at his
parents' house briefly, then flee.

                           ..................

Authorities say Schanot left the St. Louis area shortly after
graduating in May from Vianney High School, where he had been an
honor student. A federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has called
Schanot a computer genius capable of entering almost any computer
system.

An indictment returned here March 14 accuses Schanot of hacking into
the computers of Southwestern Bell, Bell Communications Research,
Sprint and SRI International, a research and development contractor
with government contracts.

As part of the hearing Friday, the government played a tape-recorded
telephone conversation several months ago between Schanot's father,
Michael Schanot, and Netta Gilboa. Christopher Schanot had been
living with Gilboa in the Philadelphia area.
