3. More About IRG
-----------------
        Well IRG is not working out as I had planned.  I had recieved no
letters and it was December 30, two days before IRG-03 was going to come out.
Luckily The Spectral Demon came through and uploaded a letter on NUI's that he
had hacked out.  I hope by next time I will get two or three letters.  IRG news
will be produced bi-weekly, to get this info out to faster.  So lets get those

        Well there you go!  Next, is the beautiful and useful skill of how to
use a garrot.
        How To Use A Garrot:
              Here's a quick and simple why to get rid of your boss...The Use
of the garrot.  The Garrot is a ultra-effective device for beheading people.
It incorporates all the facets which make up a great weapon: speed, silence,
simplicity, and deadliness.  It is constructed from two pieces of wood with a
section of piano wire attached.
        Upon approach, they are raised, crossed as the wire is brought forward,
down and over the head of the enemy.  Thus at the back of the head the wires
are crossed over and left hand pulls to the left, and the right hand to the
right.  Pop!  And there you go on beheaded enemy...
        How To Make Smokeless Gunpowder:
                This is a simple way to make smokeless gunpowder.
        1.Boil cotton for 30 minutes, in a 2 percent solution of sodium
hydroxide.
        2.Wash the cotton in hot water and allow it to dry.
        3.Mix slowly and carefully at 25 degrees Centigrade, 250 cc. of
concentrated sulfuric acid, 150 cc. of concentrated nitric acid, and 20 cc of
water.  They must be kept at 25 degrees C.
        4.Next place the dried cotton in the acid solution, and stir well with
either a glass or porcelain rod (do not use metal).  This should be done for 35
minutes.
        5.After nitration, the acids are washed away, and the cotton is washed
in boiling water five times, each time for 25 minutes.  The cotton is given
several tests with litmus paper.  If litmus test proves that there is still
some acid present, a 2 percent solution of sodium bicarbonate should
neutralize whatever is left.  This is important, since any remaining acid acts
as an impurity to make the explosive more unstable.
        And there you have how to make Smokeless Gun Powder.
        How To Make Tetryl:
        Tetryl is commonly used as and with TNT.  It act in almost the same way
as TNT when detonated.  Heres a four step way to make tetryl.
        1.A small amount of dimethyllanilime is dissolved in an excess amount
of concentrated sulfuric acid.
        2.This mixture is now added to an equal amount of nitric acid.  The new
mixture is kept in an ice bath, and is well stirred.
        3.After about five mintues, the tetryl is filtered and then washed in
cold water.
        4.It is now boiled in fresh water, which contains a small amount of
sodium bicarbonate.  This process acts to neutralize any remaining acid.  The
washings are repeated as many times as necessary according to the litmus-paper
tests.  When you are satisfied that the tetryl is free of acid, filter it from
the water and allow it to dry.

5. Letters From Prison
----------------------
        I am going to include a recipe on LSD 25 and a few other LSD recipes.
The LSD 25 recipe is the exact patent that was registered to the United States
Government. The other recipes someone else made...
        WARNING: Do not fuck around with any drugs unless you know what you're
getting into, LSD can fuck you up bad...But I do it anyways!
        This is directly out of The Anarchist Cookbook.  Any comments in this<>
kind of bracket is something I put in.  Remember the Anarchist Cookbook was
written in 1971.  Also in here is a little background and how to deal with the
blackmarket!
        The other section of Letters From Prison was writen by The Spectral
Demon.

5a. Background on LSD:
----------------------
        I think, of all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is the most
interesting and the strangest.  It is the most recent major drug<Besides
Ecstacy> in the psychedelic subculture.  Huxley experimented with mescaline
many years before psychedelics reached their mass-market proportions, but this
expertimentation was not with the same frame of mind as these drugs are handled
today.  Probably the greatgranddaddy to the whole psychedelic community was
Antonin Artaud, who personally experimented with peyote in Mexico.  The
difference between Huxley's and Artaud's experimentation was that Huxley
managed to keep his experiences under laboratory controls, which he set up
himself, whereas Artuad allowed his experiences to become part of his life.
Artuad was changed by his encounters with Peyote, but is this bad?  A dirty
shirt is also changed when it is washed.  Through this change, Artuad was able
to see and understand ideas and concepts on a different level.  He was able to
tear apart rationalizations, without regard for contemporary methods of
organization, or even contemporary versions of truth.  Artuad found, in his own
way, his own truth and his own structure of values.  They locked him up....

        I died at Rodex under electroshock.
        I died.  Legally and medically died.

        Electroshock coma lasts fifteen minutes.  A half an hour or more and
then the patient breathes.
        Now one hour after the shock, I still had not awakened and had stopped
breathing.  Surprised at my abnormal rigidity, an attendant had gone to get
the physician in charge, who, after examining me with a stethoscope, found no
more signs of life in me.

        This passage is taken from The Artuad Anthology, published by City
Lights Publishers.  I find it extremely difficult to throw this off as the
ravings of a madman for, if that be true, then there can be no truth, only
madness and sanity, logic, and illogic.  If one then accepts the acceptable, he
finds a narrow channel is clear, but the presence of illogic and the so-called
insanities will always pry and harp in the distance.
        LSD has NEVER caused insanity.  It does not have that power.  Only man
can distinguish between sanity and insanity.  I have never seen an insane bird.
 Granted there are some individuals who shouldn't take psychedelics, but this
is, and must be, their choice.  All LSD does is allow a man to look upon
ordinary things, everyday things, and even on himself, many times for the first
time, with clarity of vision.  He can look and not be hampered by false-propped
values and socially limited scope.  He can look upon the world and see beauty
where it did not exist before.  He can perceive the ugliness for the first
time. He can roar with laughter at the multitude of absurdities surrounding
him.  He can look into himself and see truthfully the mildew and the rot.
        LSD cannot bring out latent qualities in your personality.  It cannot
make you into a crazy, just as it cannot make you into a warmer, more
beautiful, person.  What LSD can do is show you what you as a person are
comprised of, and break down truthfully your make-up.  LSD is not a religion,
and I've never found<Same for me>anything really divine about it at all.  The
real religion, if you want to put it in those terms, is the being itself.  LSD
is nothing more than a medium to discover the essence of being.
        Buy LSD On The Street:
        LSD, or acid, has been illegal for the last few years;<more like the
last 20 years>therefore it is readily available on the black market.  When
buying anything on the black market, there are a couple of things to note, but
these are especially important with acid.<Even worse today>
        1. Never buy from a stranger, or on the street.<Actually its ok to buy
           up to about 15 hits on the street, just in case it bunk stuff>
        2. Never front money. 
        3. If you are holding large amounts of money, do not go anywhere alone
           with someone you don't trust.  Many people who have got into dealing
           pot and acid are, in reality, junkies.
        4. When going to make a deal for dope, don't take a weapon with you.
           This is provoking violence and legal hassles.  If you don't trust
           the guy, then don't deal with him.<I carry a gun, if I can, but I
           never show it>
        5. Never buy a large quanity of any drug without first sampling it.
        6. When making a deal for acid and you are at the dealer's apartment,
           do not accept food or drink from him; for the real acid may be in
           the food rather than the cap you sample.<Never had this happen, for
           it would be a waste of a customer, and no one would ever go to him
           again after they heard that he had sold someone bunk hits.>
        7. Bad acid is usually nothing more than speed, or rat poison.
        8. About a year ago<Again about 20 years ago> there was a substance
           called L.B.J. going around.  If you happen to come across it, DO NOT
           buy it.  L.B.J. is a mixutre of acid, belladonna, and heroine.  It is
           the freakiest, worst, most fucked-up trip you will ever go on.
           Belladonna in quantity is a deadly poison.
        9. About 99 percent of all of what is claimed to be T.H.C(synthetic
           pot) that is for sale on the street is not realy T.H.C at all.  The
           expense of making synthetic pot is said to be about 15$ per capsule,
           and a capsule of alleged T.H.C usually sells on the street for about
           $2.50.<Of course that was in 1971, I have never seen THC sold on the
           streets, but if it still is, it will be a hell of alot more then
           $2.50>Obviously the vendors are either philanthropists(not likely)
           or they are selling you something other then T.H.C.
        10.When buying grass,watch out for damp grass or grass sprayed with
           suger, as this adds a lot of weight to the dope.<There is pot that
           has either crystal or cocaine on it that is sold on the streets.
           Of course it cost alot more and gives you a totaly differnt high.
           It looks alot like pot with sugar on it so ask what you're buying>
        11.Another favorite con game is "in the front, out the back." This
           usually occurs when your dealer tells you he is going up to an
           apartment to get your stuff, but you have to front the money, and
           wait for him on the street.  You may be waiting a long time.
        12.Do not attempt to smuggle any drugs across the border from Mexico.
           The federal government has imposed a crackdown and they're busting
           people left and right.
        Making LSD In The Laboratory:
        To make synthetic acid, you need a basic understanding of chemistry and
access to a lab.  Since I don't quite understand all the chemical hocus-pocus,
I'm going to copout and quote you the patent for it.  If you don't understand
chemistry, just skip this recipe and go on to the next one for acid, it's much
simpler. 
        Preparation for Lysergic Acid Amides:
        United States Patent Office                     2,736,728
                Patented February 28, 1956
        Richard P. Pioch, Indianapolis, Indiana, assignor, to Eli Lilly and
Co.,Indianapolis, Indiana, a corporation of Indiana.
        No drawing.  Application December 6,1954, Serial No. 473,443. 10
claims. (Cl. 260-285.5)
        
        This invention relates to the preparation of lysergic acid amides and
to a nover intermediate compound useful in the preparation of said amides.
        Although only a few natural and synthetic amides of lysergic acid are
known, they possess a number of different and useful pharmacologic properties.
Especially useful in ergonovine, the N-(1(+)-1-hydroxyisopropyl)amide of
d-lysergic acid, which is employed commercially as an oxytocic agent.
        Attempts to prepare lysergic acid amides by the usual methods of
preparing amides, such as reacting an amine with lysergic acid chloride or with
an ester of lysergic acid, have been unsuccessful.  United States Patents No.
2,090,429 and No. 2,090,430, describe processes of preparing lysergic acid
amides and, although these processes are ffective to accomplish the desired
conversion of lysergic acid to one of its amides, they are not without certain
disadvantages.
        By my invention I have provided a simple and convenient method of
preparing lysergic acid amides, which comprises reacting lysergic acid with
trifluoroacectic anhydride to produce a mixed anhydride of lysergic and
triflouroacetic acids, and when reacting the mixed anhydride with a nitrogenous
base having at least one hydrogen linked with nitrogen.  The resulting amide of
lysergic acid is isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional means.
        The reaction of the lysergic and the triflouroacectic anhydride is a
low temperature reaction, that is, it must be carried out at a temperature
below 0 degrees C.  The presently preferred temperature range is about -15 C.
to about -20 C.  This range is sufficiently high to permit the reaction to
proceed at a desirably fast rate, but yet provides and adequate safegaurd
against a too rapid reaction which would result in a high reaction temperature
and consequent excessive decomposition of the mixed anhydride.
        The reaction is carried out in a suitable dispersing agent, that is,
one which is inert with respect to the reactants.  The lysergic acid is
relatively insoluble in dispersants suitable for carrying out the reaction, so
it is suspended in the dispersant.
        Two gallons of triflouroacetic anhydride are required per mol. of
lysergic acid for rapid and complete conversion of lysergic acid into mixed
anhydride.  It appears that one molecule of the anhydride associates with or
favors an ionic adduct with one molecule of the lysergic which contains a basic
nitrogen atom and that it is the adduct which reacts with a second molecule of
trifluoroacectic anhydride to form the mixed anhydride along with one molecule
of trifluoroacetic acid.  The conversion of lysergic acid to the mixed
anhydride occurs within a relatively short time, but to insure a complete
conversion the reaction is allowed to proceed for about one to three hours.
        The mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacecetic acids is
relatively unstable, especially at room temperature and above, and must be
stored at a low temperature.  This temperature instability of the mixed
anhydride makes it desirable that it be converted into a lysergic acid amide
withuot unneccessary delay.  The mixed anhydride itself, since it contains a
lysergic acid group, also can exist in the reaction mixture in large part as an
ionic adduct with triflouroacetic anhydride or trifluoroacetic acid.  It is
important for maximum yield of product that the lysergic acid employed in the
reaction be dry.  It is most convenient to dry the acid by heating it at
105-110 degrees C. in a vacuum of about 1mm. of mercury or less for a few
hours, although any other customary means of drying can be used.
        The conversion of the mixed anhydride into an amide by reacting the
anhydride with the nitrogenous base, such as an amino compund, can be carried
out at room temperature or below.  Most conveniently the reaction is carried
out by adding cold solution of the mixed anhydride to the amino compund or a
solution thereof which is at about room temperature.  Because of the acidic
components present in the reaction mixture of the mixed anhydride, about five
mols or equivalent of the amino compund are required per mol or equivalent of
mixed anhydride for maximal conversion of mixed anhydride to the amide.
Preferably a slight excess over the five mols is employed to insure complete
utilization of the mixed anhydride.  If desired, a basic substance capable of
neutralizing the acid components present in reaction mixture, but incapable of
interfering with the reaction, can be utilized.  A strongly basic tertary amine
is an example of such a substance.  In such case, about one equivelent of amino
compound to be converted to a lysergic acid amide, as well as any unconverted
lysergic acid, can be removed from the reaction mixutre and can be re-employed
in other conversions.
        A preferred method for carrying out the process of this invention is as
follows:
        Dry lysergic acid is suspended in a suitable vehivle as acetonitrile,
and the suspension is cooled to about -15C. or -20 C.  To the suspension is
then addes slowly a solution of about two equivalents of triflouroacetic
anhydride dissolved in acetonitrile and previously cooled to about -20 degrees
C.  The mixture is maintained in a low temperature for about one to three hours
to insure the completion of the formation of the mixed anhydride of lysergic
and trifluoroacetic acids.
        The solution of the mixed anhydride is then added to about five
equivelents of amino compund which is to be reacted with the mixed anhydride.
The amino compund need not be previusly dissolved in a solvent, although it is
usually convenient to use a solvent.  The reaction is carried out with the
amino compound or solution of amino compound ar or about room temperature or
below.  The reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for one or
two hours, preferably in the dark, and the solvent is then removed by
evaporation in vacuo at a temperature which desirably is not greatly excess of
room temperature.  The viscous residue, consisting of the amide together with
excess amine and amine salts, is taken up in a mixture of chloroform and water.
 The water is separated and the chloroform soltuion which contains the amide is
washed several times with water to remove excess amine and the varous amine
salts formed in the reaction, including that of any unconverted lysergic acid.
The chloroform solution is then dried and evaporated, leaving a residue of
lysergic acid amide.  The amide so obtained can be purified by any conventional
procedure.
        Disperants suitable for the purpose of this invention are those which
are liquids at the low temperatures employed for the reaction and are of such
an inert naturethat they will not react preferentially to the lysergic acid
with trifluoroacetic anhydride.  Among suitable dispersants are acetonitrile,
dimethylformamide, propionitrile, and the like.  Additional suitable agents
will readily be apparent from foregoing enumeration.  Of those listed above,
acetonitrile is preferred since it is non-reactive and mobile at the
temperature used, and is relatively volatile and hence readily separable from
the reaction mixture by evaporation in vacuo.
        A wide variety of nitrogenous bases such as amino compunds can be
reacted with mixed anhydride to form a lysergic acid amide.  As previously
stated, the amino compund must contain a hydrogen atom attached to nitrogen to
permit amide formation.  Illustrative amino compounds which can be reacted are
ammonia, hydrazine, primary amine such as glycine, ethanolamine,
diglycylglycine, norephedrine, aminopropanol, butanolamine, diethylamine,
ephedrine, and the like.
        When an alkanolamine such as ethanlamine or aminopropanol is reacted
with the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacectic acids, the reaction
product contains not only the desired hydroxy amide but also, to a minor
extent, some amino ester.  These two isometric substances arise becuase of the
bi-functional nature of the reacting alkanolamine.  Ordinarily the amino ester
amounts to no more then 25-30 percent of the total amount of reaction product,
but in cases where the amino group is esterically hindered, the proportion of
amino ester will be increased.  The amino ester can readily be converted to the
disired hydroxy amide, and the over-all yield of the latter incressed by
treating the amino ester, or the mixture of amide and ester with alcoholic
alkali to cause the rearrangement of the amino ester to desired hydroxy amide.
Most conventiently the conversion is carried out by dissolving the animo esther
or mixture containing the amino ester in a minimum amount of alcohol and adding
to the mixture a twofold amount of 4 N alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution.
The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for several hours, the
alkali is neutralized with acid, and the lysergic acid amine is then isolated
and petrified.

often I will have a master list printed.  All changes to VMBs will be posted in
each IRG News.

8.Running The ShadowNet
-----------------------
        ShadowNet is the newest addition to IRG.  It is a information service
for anyone willing to pay.  ShadowNet works the way a Private Investigator
works...you pay us to find out information on people, except we will do much
more than that.

        We will go one step farther than any PI would go.  We will change his
phone #, send him 100 pizzas, or ruin his credit rate.  Of course the more you
pay the better you get.  At the beginning we will work for free to show that we
can do what you ask.  So get your orders in fast.  All we need is a name, phone
number, handle, whatever.  The more information you start giving us the
more you will get back.  I also am in need of "agents" or people to help work
with me.  I hope to get at least one person in each area code so information
can be found easier and faster.  Of course you are not restricted to the
computer oriented community. We can and WILL find information on ANYONE. We'll
also work for anyone who is willing to pay. So let's hear from you, either on
my BBS/VMB.  Give me your voice phone number, and your name.  I will contact you
for who you want ShadowNet to find out about. If you would like to join leave
the same info but tell me that you want to join.  Simple enough. Until Next
time.


9.Hellos and Goodbyes
