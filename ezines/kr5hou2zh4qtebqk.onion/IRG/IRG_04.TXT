        Thats it folks.  Now for How to make TNT!
        
        How To Make TNT:
        Probably the most important explosive compund in use today is TNT
(trinitrotoluene).  This and other very similar types of high explosives are
all used by the military, because of their fantastic power - about 2.25 million
punds per square inch, and their great stability.  TNT also has the great
advantage of being able to be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it can be poured
into shells, mortars, or any other projectiles.  Military TNT comes in
containers which resemble dry cell batteries, and are usually ignited by an
electrical charge, coupled with an electrical blasting cap, although there are
toher methods.
        Preparation:
        1. Take two beakers.  In the first, prepare a solution of 76% sulfuric
acid, 23% nitric acid, and 1% water.  IN the other beaker, prepare another
solution of 57% nitric acid and 43% sulfuric acid (percentages are on a weight
ratio rather than volume.)
        2. Ten grams of the first solution is poured into an empty beaker and
placed in an ice bath.
        3. Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.
        4. Remove this beaker from the ice bath and grently heat until it
reaches 50 degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.
        5. Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added
and the temperature is allowed to rise to 55 gegrees C.  This temperature is
held for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will begin to form on the top
of the acid.
        6. After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice
bath, and cooled to 45 degrees C.  When reaching this temperature, the oily
liquid will sink and collect at the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the
remaining acid solution should be drawn off, by using a syringe.
        7. Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily
liquid while the temperature is slowly being raised to 83 degrees C.  After the
temperature is reached, it is maintained for a full half hour.
        8. At the end of this period, the solution is allowed to cool to 60
degrees C., and is held at this temperature for another full hour.  After this,
the acid is again drawn off, leaving once more onlt the oily liquid at the bottom.
        9. Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is
gently heated to 80 degrees C.  All temperature increases must be accomplished
slowly and gently.
        10. Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second
acid solution are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 degrees C to 104
degrees C., and is held for three hours.
        11. After this three-hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees
C, and is held for a hlaf hour.
        12. After this half hour, the oil is removed from the acid and washed
with boiling water.
        13. After the waching with boiling water, while being stirred
constantly, the TNT will begin to solidify.
        14. When the solidifications has started, cold water is added to the
beaker, so that the TNT will form into pellets.  Once this is done, you have
good quality TNT.
        NOTE: The temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are exact, and
must be used as such.  Do not estimate or use approximations.  Buy a good
centigrade thermometer.

        And there you have it.  Thats all for CyberPunk Follys this time!


5. Letters From Prison
----------------------
        This issue of IRG News we have a bunch of things, write by Control-S
and myself.  First is the rest of how to make LSD.  The end of the patent and
with some easy recipes that can be make in YOUR kitchen!

5a. The Rest of How To Make LSD
-------------------------------
        This is were I left off last time.
The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for several hours, the
alkali is neutralized with acid, and the lysergic acid amine is then isolated
and petrified.
        It should be understood that, as used herein, the term "lysergic acid"
is used generically as inclusive of any or all of the four possible
stereoisomers having the basic lysergic acid structure.  Isomers of the
lysergic acid series can be separated or interconverted by means known to the
art.
        This invention is further illustrated by the following specific
examples. 
                Example One
        Preparation of the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacectic
acids: 
        5.36g. of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml. of acentonitrile and
the syspension is cooled to about -20 degrees C.  To this suspension is added a
cold (-20 degrees C) solution of 8.82 g. of trifluoroacetic anhydride in 75 ml.
of acetonitrile.  The mixture is allowed to stand at -20 degrees C. for about 1
1/2 hours during which time the suspended material dissolves, and the
d-lysergic acid is converted to the mixed anhydride of lysergic and
trifluoroacetic acids.  The mixed anhydride can be separated in the form of an
oil by evaporating the solvent in vacuo at a temperature below about 0 degrees
C.
                Example Two
        Preparation of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide:
        A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid and trifluoroacetic
acid in 200 ml. of acetonitrile is obtained by reacting 5.36 g. d-lysergic acid
and 8.82 g. trifluoroacetic anhydride in accordance with the procedure of
example one.  The acetonitrile solution containing mixed anhydride is added to
150 ml. of acetonitrile containing 7.6 g. of giethylamine.  The mixture is held
in the dark at room temperature for about two hours.  The acetonitrile is
evaporated in vacuo leaving a residue which comprises the "normal" and "iso"
forms of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide together with some lysergic acid,
the diethylamine salt of trifluoroacetic acid and like byproducts.  The residue
is dissolved in a mixture of 150 ml. of chloroform and 20 ml. of ice water.
The chloroform layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with
four 50 ml. portions of chloroform.  The chloroform extracts are combined and
are washed four times with about 50 ml. portions of cold water in order to
remove residual amounts of amine salts.  The chloroform layer is then dried
over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the chloroform is evaporated in vacuo.  A
solid residue of 3.45 gm. comprising the "normal" and "iso" forms of d-lysergic
acid N,N-diethylamide is obtained.  This material is dissolved in 160 ml. of
3-to-1 misture of benzene and chloroform, and is chromatogramed over 250 g. of
basic alumia.  As the chromatogram is developed with the same solvent, two blue
fluorescing zones appear on the alumina column.  The more rapidly moving zone
is d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide which is eluted with about 3000 ml. of the
same solvent as above, the course of elution being followed by watching the
downward movement of the more rapidly moving blue fluorescing zone.  The eluate
is treated with tartaric acid to form the acid tartrade of d-lysergic acid
N,N-diethylamide which is isolated.  The acid tartrate of d-lysegic acid
N,N-diethylamide melts with decomposition at about 190-196 degrees C.
        The di-iso-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide which remains absorbed on
the alumina column as the second fluorescent zone is removed from the column by
elution with chloroform.  The "iso" form of amide is recovered by evaporating
the chloroform eluate to dryness in vacuo.
                Example Three
        Preparation of d-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide:
        A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid and trifluoroacetic
acid is prepared from 2.68 g. of d-lysergic acid and 4.4 g. of trifluoroacetic
acid anhydride in 100 ml. of acentonitrile by the method of Example One.  This
solution is added to 6:03 g. of diethylaminoethylamine.  The reaction mixture
is kept in the dark at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours.  The acetonitrile is
evaporated, and the residue treated with chloroform and water as described in
Example Two.  The residue treated comprising d-iso-lysergic acid
N-diethylaminoethyl amide is dissolved in several ml. of ethyl acetate, and the
solution is cooled to about 0 degrees C, whereupon di-iso-lysergic acid
N-diethylaminoethyl amide separates in crystalline form. The crystalline
material is filtered off, and the filtrate reduced in volume to obtain an
additional amount of crystalline amide.  Recrystallization from ethyl acetate
of the combined fractions of crystalline material yields d-iso-lysergic acid
N-diethylaminoethyl amide melting at about 157-158 degrees C.  The optical
rotation is as follows:
        [x] d^26<that is an exponet>= +372 gedrees (C. = 1.3 in pyridine)
        
        There has been in the last few years a great deal of discussion about
the correct treatment for victims of bad LSD trips.  When an individual does go
into a panic on acid, it is an extremely delicate situation.  Although it has
been said that tranquilizers, such as thorazine, will help to calm the person
down, be very careful, as certain drugs react violently with tranquilizers
(STP).  My advice in a situation of that sort is just to attempt to create an
atmosphere of reasurance and sympathy.  In no circumstances, except real
uncontrollable panic, should a person on acid be taken to a city hospital.  If
you want a freaky experiance, spend a couple of hours at any city hospital and
watch the people die in the halls!
        Talk to a person and remind him that he is under the influence of acid.
Try to calm him down.  Even a change of environment can effectively reverse a
bad trip.

        Making LSD in the kitchen:
        For those readers who couldn't make head or tail of the last recipe for
acid, there is a much sipler one.  It basically extracts the lysergic acid
amide either from morning glory seeds or Hawaiian wood rose seeds.  It can be
prepared in the kitchen.
        1. Grind up 150 grams of morning glory seeds or baby Hawaiian wood rose
seeds.
        2. In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
        3. Filter the solution through a tight screen
        4. Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
        5. For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
        6. Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1".
        7. Resoak the mush in 110cc of wood alcohol for two days.
        8. Filter and throw away the mush.
        9. Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1".
        10. Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.
        11. When all the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains.  This
hould be scraped up and put into capsules.
                30 grams of morning glory seeds = one trip
                15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds     = one trip
                
        Many companies, such as Northop-King, have been coating their seeds
with a toxic chemical, which is poison.  Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it
is much safer and cheaper.  Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly
from: 
                        Chong's Nursery and Flowers
                        P.O. Box 2154
                        Honolulu, Hawaii
                       
        LSD Dosages:
        The basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid a
available and what medium of ingestion is used.  Chemically the potency of
LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or mics.  If you're chemically minded or
making your own acid, then computing the number of micrograms is very
important.  Usually between 300 to 500 mics is plenty for a five- to eight-hour
trip, depending on the quality of the acid, of course.  I have heard of people
taking as much as 1,500 to 2,00 mics.  This is not only extremely dangerous, it
is also wasteful.
        LSD comes packaged in amny diffrent forms.  The proverbial suger cube
is pretty passe', in the sense that other more feasible methods have taken its
place.  The most common are listed below.
1. The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried drop of LSD on it, is
always around.  Usually one spot equals one trip.
2. Capsuled acid is extremely tricky, as the cap can be almost any color, size,
and potency.  Always ask what the acid is cut with, as a lot of acid is cut
with either speed or strychnine.  Also note dosage.
3.  Small white or colored tablets have been known to contain acid, but, as
with the capsuled acid, it is impossible to tell potency, without asking.
4. I have heard about some charaters who attempted to choot acid.  Shooting any
drug is a bad scene.  Stay way from it.  I cannot imagine what their rush was
like, but would certainly adivse against this form of drug abuse.
 
        
5b. Trashing Tips & Tricks By Control-S
---------------------------------------

Disclaimer: This phile is for information purposes only, the author
will not be responsible for any actions the reader takes as a result
of reading this, and/or printing it out and eating the paper.

WARNING: reading this file may cause mental instability.


Trashing:
--------

Trashing is one of the best ways to obtain information not readily
available to you. You can find many interesting things in other
people's garbage, the trick is knowing what is good trash and what
is useless trash. "One man's trash is another man's goldmine", words
to live by! 


1.0 - Intro to Trashing
1.1 - What you need
1.2 - Where to Trash
1.3 - How to Trash
1.4 - What to do with your trash






1.1:Trashing Tools:

Attire: You should wear the most grungy outfit you can put together.
(for some of you, this means 'dress as if you had a date' -heh.)
Ripped jeans are alwayz a plus, and a large overcoat is a nice touch.
If you have a t-shirt that sayz 'Recycle or Die' or any other social
activist type slogan, wear it, it will make you look like a social
activist type. (People rarely fuck with social activists, as they
are for the large part quite fanatical and prone to be unstable).

Carry alongs: You should have 2 large garbage bags, fill one with about
20-30 aluminum cans (it may be noisy, but its a good cover!), leave
the second bag empty, this is where you're going to stash your goodies.

Other: If you're planning on trashing someplace were you could come
across some discarded floppy disks, you should have an array of programs
at home to help you recover data from these disks, as most will either
be formatted, or riddled with bad sectors. Utilities for undeleting,
uncopyprotecting, recovering sectors and editing sectors are available
practically everywhere (even in the Public Domain!).



1.2:Where To Trash:

Depending on what you're interested in, you have to decide where you're
going to look. Dept. stores are good for credit card carbons, and TRW/
CBI accounts. Office buildings can have just about anything, from office
memos to logins and passwords. Likewise, buildings occupied by a software
or hardware company can have logins, and discarded reference manuals.
Schools/Universities are one of the BEST places to find great stuff,
there is a problem with the amount of garbage you'd have to go through
at a school, because they really generate a lot (of the worthless kind!)
so if you're going to do a school, you should hit the inside trash cans
of the Library, and the Computer Lab (if you can get in). You should also
scan desks in both, as many students, being the lazy student types, will
write passwords on desks! (I've gotten internet accounts using this method).
TelCo buildings are both hard to find, and dangerous. They are almost
universally unmarked buildings with darkened windows, absolutely no way
to tell what the building is. (typical gestapo headquarters!) They also
will be alert for people dumpster diving -- itz certainly nothing new!




1.3:Trashing:

Okay, now that you're suited up and have bags in hand, at the right
location, you're ready to get to buisness. Its good to bring a car,
or someone with a car, this will provide both a base of operation, and
a quick getaway. Ideally, you'll want the car withing a quick sprinting
distance of where you'll be trashing, if you have a few people with you,
someone should stay in the car to keep lookout and be ready for whatever.
In the dumpster, things will usually be fairly orderly, (suprising as that
may sound). You'll problably come across bunches of smaller bags, look for
any that have papers, printouts or even shorthand. Keep an eye out for
diet coke cans too, this is a favorite of fat secretaries and usually
an indication of something good to come.  Look for  for anything
resembling a binder or notebook, many refernce manuals are discarded
but still incredibly useful. A good time to trash is around tax time,
as many companies will do a severe office cleaning and put some of their
records in archives after they've filed income tax reports -- as a rule
of office cleaning, many interesting things get chucked. Try and grab
things already bundled into smaller bags, its easier to carry, and if
you get one say from a computer room or office, all the excelent stuff
will be in one catch - making life easy for the trasher. After you've
gotten a few small bags and stuffed you're large garbage bag with 
junk, throw it all in the trunk and head home, (stop off an turn in
the aluminum cans you had, because recycling really is IMPORTANT). 
Don't try and look for goodies at the site, it takes to much time and
you'll prolly be in to much of a hurry and might miss something good.
Once you get home, find a good place, like the kitchen floor, spread
your trash out and start seperating it. Look for everything, you never
know what you might find, so be alert for the most atypical type of
information. Use a little common sense and ingenuity and you're set.

 

1.4:Trash Use:

For the most part, you should be able to distinguish what might be
useful and how to use it, however there may be cases where you could
get an accountname/password or such, and not know what its to or how
to use it. If this is the case, look up the # of the place you trashed
in the phonebook, and scan the entire exchange for carrier signals.
This sounds like a pain in the ass, but really its not, scanning is
a great way to find computers, and one of my personal favorite pastimes.
Scanning a single exchange tes less than a week, and you'll prolly
find a lot of other carriers while you're at it.


Well, thatz about all there is to it, you're set to trash. Have phun!


Questions? Comments? Keep them to yerself!  -hah! j/k, I can be contacted
on The Corrupt Society, and Insanity Lane, for whatever.

Look for my scan files to be comming out soon.

5c. Interesting places to telnet to on the Internet:<Ctrl-S>
-----------------------------------------------
Note: This is by NO means an exaustive list, merely tid-bits. The 
internet is so huge, and complex, one would shutter at the mere
magnitude to trying to put together anything like a 'complete'
list of interesting things found there, so I've weeded it down to
a very few. (for infomation on anonymous FTP's, and Inet bbs'es,
there are other text files available many places, again, this list
is of only a few, and in my opinion, some of the more interesting
internet sites.

Mars Hotel: mars.ee.msstate.edu (130.18.64.3)   
login: bbs
notes: Phrack/cud/ATI/PHun/LOD/lots more, good messages, (VERY good bbs)

notes: lots of files

notes: busy chat system

notes: type 'IRC' (just an alternate route to fairhope)

TAC: (192.67.67.20)
login: tacnews
notes: CERT bulletins available



The following is a list of dialouts, reachable via telnet. Most 
have been compiled from various bbses, and a few I hunted out
myself. Please don't abuse these, there are only so many lines
on each modem, and if you piss off the administrators, they will
simply disconnect them.

Thats about it for now, I'll probably be updating this file 
every now and then, so stay tuned to IRG for more interesting
stuff found on the internet.
Questions, Comments? - I can be reached at TCS and Insanity Lane

I'd like to mention one more thing; code abuse and credit card fraud
are lame, it only increases the wrongfully portrayed image of hackers,
and harms EVERYONE. 'C0deZ' has NOTHING to do with phreaking, and
'carding' is just plain stupid. Don't be lame, and don't do them.
(my $.02)

6.BBSs From Hell
----------------
        I have found that this part of IRG news is pre–etty worthless and most
Elite users can find board numbers no problem.  I have decided to descontinue
this part.  I will keep VMBs from hell since VMBs are rather hard to find.

8.Running The ShadowNet
-----------------------
        The first use of ShadowNet has gone and passed.  As I told you last
time ShadowNet would be working for free the first few times.  Well We were
hired to find out about some by the name of Casey ?????(his last name will be
left out just in case you know him).  ShadowNet found out his phone number,
and his address.  We procceded in cansuling his credit cards, turning his phone
off, and bothering him most completely.  We figure he will never bother our
client again.
        If anyone else would like to hire us, please contact us.  We are still
going for free...
