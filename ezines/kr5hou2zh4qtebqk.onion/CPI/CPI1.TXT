                              [1.1] Introduction:
                              -------------------

      Welcome  to  "Computer  Viruses  - A Protagonist's Point Of View." This
 letter,  perhaps  the  beginning of a small newsletter. Well, this "letter,"
 is  written  by  one person right now, maybe I'll get some people to send in
 more  info,  ideas,  and  examples  to CPI. If you would like to contribute,
 please  upload  text  files to CPI Headquarters (see heading for number) and
 leave a note to me telling me you are contributing to our magazine.

      Well,  as  an  overview,  this  article will cover a few topics dealing
 with  viruses; however, there will be no examples covered as we are short of
 programmers  at  the  moment. That reminds me, if you would like to become a
 member  of  CPI, fill out the accompanying text file and upload it to CPI HQ
 as  an upload to the Sysop, then leave me and the Sysop some mail to tell us
 you  registered  to  become  a  member.  We  will get back to you as soon as
 possible.

      The  purpose  of  this  magazine  is  to expand and broaden the general
 computer  user's  view and knowledge of the dreadful computer Virus, as well
 as  a  bit  on  Trojans  (not  the hardware, the SOFTWARE!). Then, after the
 knowledge  of  these  computer  crackers  is  better  understood, the second
 purpose  of  this  newsletter  is  to  teach  both methods of developing and
 executing  a  better  virus/trojan.  We, CPI, feel viruses and trojans are a
 vital  part  of  the  computer  world,  and should stand along the trades of
 hacking,  phreaking, cracking, pirating, and pyro as an equal, not something
 to be looked down upon (unless you are hit by one...).

      In  the  future,  we  hope CPI will grow and spread, just like a virus,
 and  encompass  a large domain of the crackers, hackers, and other elite out
 there  so  that  the  life  of  this group will be maintained, and that this
 newsletter,  hopefully,  won't  be  the only issue to be released during the
 group's existence.

      Also, please note that this  newsletter is purely for the spread of new
 ideas and to educate  the reader of this "new" software technonlogy, and the
 document, and  the  author  of the document  do not encourage or support any
 illegal  use  of  the  information  contained,  and  the  reader  is  solely
 responsible for their actions after aquiring this document.

                      [1.2] Viruses- What, Where, Why, How


          If  you  are a beginner in this field, you may be curious to what
     a  virus/trojan  is.  Perhaps  you heard about it through some BBS, or
     known  someone  who had their system crashed by one. Well, this is for
     you.

          In  the  Trojan  War,  way  back  when,  there existed the Trojan
     Horse,  right? Well, nowadays, there is a modern version of the Trojan
     Horse  existing  is  software.  The  modern, computer, Trojan horse is
     really  simple,  a psychedelic hacker implants destructive code into a
     normal  (or  fake)  file.  This modified/fake file, when executed will
     destroy  or  remove  something  from the host computer, usually format
     the  hard  drive,  delete all files, or something similar. In order to
     distribute  the corrupt phile, the hacker goes and does one or more of
     various  things;  depending on how deranged this individual is (hehe).
     These things are covered in the following section.

          A  virus,  in  normal  terms  is an organism which spreads malign
     from  one  host  to  another,  transmitting  itself through biological
     lines  so  that  both  the  previous  host  and the future host become
     infected  with  the virus. Today, there are computer viruses, and just
     like  biological viruses, they spread from file to file, host to host,
     infecting  everything  it  "sees."  These  computer viruses can either
     destroy  the  code  it  infects immediately, or over a period of time,
     corrupt  or  damage  the  host  system it thrives upon. For example, a
     virus  hidden in a file on a BBS could be downloaded to a host system.
     Then,  the  user  who  downloaded it executes the file, which executes
     normally  (as  seen  by the operator), but at the same time, the virus
     attacks  other files, and infects them, so that each file owned by the
     user  becomes  infected  with the virus. Then, at a given time or when
     something  is fulfilled by the host system, the virus becomes a trojan
     and  destroys,  encrypts, or damages everything available, infected or
     un-infected.  In  general,  a  virus is a timed trojan that duplicates
     itself  to  other  files,  which, in effect sustains the virus's life-
     span  in  the  computer world, as more host systems are infiltrated by
     the disease.

          Now  that  I've given you a description of the computer virus and
     trojan, we can go onto more complex things... well, not really...

          Ok,  now, let's trace the life of a virus. A virus/trojan is born
     in  the  mind  of  some  hacker/programmer  that  decides  to  develop
     something   out   of   the   ordinary,  not  all  viruses/trojans  are
     destructive,  often, some are amusing! Anyway, the hacker programs the
     code  in  his/her  favorite  language;  viruses  can be developed with
     virtually  any  language,  BASIC,  Pascal,  C, Assembly, Machine Code,
     Batch  files,  and  many  more. Then, when the disease is complete and
     tested,  the  hacker intentionally infects or implants the code into a
     host  file,  a  file  that  would be executed by another un-suspecting
     user,  somewhere  out there. Then, the hacker does one or more of many
     things  to  distribute  his  baby.  The hacker can upload the infected
     file  to  a local BBS (or many local/LD BBS's), give the infected file
     to  a  computer  enemy,  upload the infected file to his/her workplace
     (if  desired...hehe),  or  execute  the  phile  on  spot,  on the host
     system.  Then,  the virus, gets downloaded or executed, it infiltrates
     the  host  system,  and  either  infects  other  files, or trashes the
     system  instantly.  Eventually,  the infected system's user gets smart
     and either trashes his system manually and starts fresh, or some mega-
     technical  user  attempts  to recover and remove the virus from all of
     the  infected files (a horrendous job). Then, the virus dies, or other
     host  systems that were previously infected continue, and accidentally
     upload  or  hand out infected files, spreading the disease. Isn't that
     neat?

          Now,  to  answer  your  questions;  I  already  explained  what a
     virus/trojan  is  and  how they are developed/destroyed. Now, where do
     these  suckers come from? Why, some hacker's computer room, of course!
     All  viruses  and  trojans  begin at some computer where some maniacal
     hacker  programs  the  code  and implants it somewhere. Then, you ask,
     why  do they do this? Why hack? Why phreak? Why make stupid pyro piles
     of  shit?  Think about it... This is an ART! Just like the rest. While
     Hacking  delivers  theft  of  services,  Phreaking  delivers  theft of
     services,  Cracking/Pirating  delivers theft of software and copyright
     law  breaks,  Pyro  delivers  unlawful  arson/explosives,  Viruses and
     Trojans  vandalize  (yes,  legally  it is vandalism and destruction of
     property)  computer  systems  and  files. Also, these are great to get
     back  at arch-computer enemies (for you computer nerds out there), and
     just  wreak  havoc  among  your computer community. Yeah, PHUN at it's
     best...

                       [1.3] Aspects Of Some Known Viruses


          Many  viruses  have  been  written  before and probably after you
     read  this article. A few names include the Israeli, Lehigh, Pakistani
     Brain,  Alameda,  dBase,  and  Screen.  Keep in mind that most viruses
     ONLY  infect COM and EXE files, and use the Operating System to spread
     their  disease.  Also,  many viruses execute their own code before the
     host  file  begins  execution,  so  after  the virus completes passive
     execution  (without  "going  off")  the  program will load and execute
     normally.

          Israeli  - This one is a TSR virus that, once executed, stayed in
     memory  and  infected  both COM and EXE files, affecting both HARD and
     FLOPPY  disks.  Once  executed, the virus finds a place to stay in the
     system's  memory  and upon each execution of a COM or EXE file, copies
     itself  onto the host phile. This one is very clever, before infecting
     the  file,  it  preserves  the  attributes  and date/time stamp on the
     file,  modifies  the  files attributes (removes READ only status so it
     can  write  on it), and then restores all previous values to the file.
     This  virus  takes very little space, and increases the host file size
     by  approximately  1800  bytes.  The trigger of this virus is the date
     Friday  the  13th.  This  trigger will cause the virus to either trash
     the  disk/s  or delete the files as you execute them, depending on the
     version. Whoever wrote this sure did a nice job....

          Lehigh  -  This one infects the COMMAND.COM file, which is always
     run  before bootup, so the system is ready for attack at EVERY bootup.
     It  hides  itself  via  TSR type and when any disk access is made, the
     TSR  checks  the  COMMAND.COM  to  see  if  it is infected. Then if it
     isn't,  it  infects  it,  and  adds  a  point to its counter. When the
     counter  reaches  4,  the  virus  causes  the disk to crash. This one,
     however,  can be stopped by making your COMMAND.COM Read-Only, and the
     date/time  stamp  is  not  preserved,  so  if  the  date/time stamp is
     recent,  one  could  be  infected  with  this  virus.  This  virus  is
     transferred  via  infected  floppy disks as well as a clean disk in an
     infected  system.  It can not infect other hosts via modem, unless the
     COMMAND.COM is the file being transferred.

          Pakistani  Brain  -  This one infects the boot sector of a floppy
     disk.  When  booting off of the disk, the virus becomes a TSR program,
     and  then  marks  an  unused portion of the disk as "bad sectors." The
     bad  sectors,  cannot be accessed by DOS. However, a disk directory of
     an  infected  disk  will show the volume label to be @ BRAIN. A CHKDSK
     will  find  a few bad sectors. When you do a directory of a clean disk
     on  an  infected  system, the disk will become infected. The virus has
     no  trigger  and  immediately  begins  to mark sectors bad even though
     they  are  good. Eventually, you will have nothing left except a bunch
     of  bad  sectors  and  no  disk  space. The virus itself has the ASCII
     written  into  it with the words "Welcome the the Dungeon" as well the
     names  of  the  supposed  authors of the virus, and address, telephone
     number,  and  a  few  other  lame  messages.  To inoculate your system
     against  this  virus,  just type 1234 at byte offset location 4 on the
     boot track (floppy disks).

          Alameda  -  This  virus  also infects the boot sector of the host
     system.  It  is  very  small  and  inhabits  ONE sector. This one only
     damages  floppy  disks.  If  you  boot from a diseased disk, the virus
     loads  itself  into  HIGH memory and during a warm boot, it remains in
     memory  and  infects  any  other  clean disks being booted from on the
     infected  system. It then replaces the boot track with the virus track
     and  replaces  the  boot  track  on the last track of the disk, so any
     data  located  on  the  last  track  is  corrupted.  All  floppy disks
     inserted  during  reboot can catch this virus. This virus only infects
     IBM PC's and XT's, however, it does not infect 286's or 386's.

          dBase  -  This  one is a TSR virus that works in a manner similar
     to  the  Israeli  virus. It looks for files with a DBF extension, then
     it  replicates  itself in all DBF files, preserving file size, and all
     attributes.  After  the  first  90  days, the virus destroys your file
     allocation  table  and  corrupts all data in the DBF files. This virus
     creates  a  hidden  file,  BUG.DAT that indicates the bytes transposed
     (in  order to preserve file specifications). Run a CHKDSK to make sure
     you  don't  have  any  extra  hidden  files or a BUG.DAT in your dBase
     directory.  If  you  create a BUG.DAT file manually in your directory,
     making it read-only, you will be safe from this virus.

          Screen  -  This  one  is  another TSR virus that comes on and off
     periodically.  When  it is on, it examines the screen memory and looks
     for  any  4  digits  starting at a random place on the screen. Then it
     transposes  two  of  them,  this is not a good thing. It infects every
     COM  file  in  your  directory, HARD and FLOPPY disks can be infected.
     You  can  use  a  ASCII  searcher  to  check  if  you  are infected by
     searching  for  "InFeCt"  in your COM files. If you have this written,
     read  the  4  bytes immediately preceding it and overwrite the first 4
     bytes  of  the program with their value. Then, truncate the program at
     their  stored  address. You will rid yourself of this virus. Make sure
     you use a clean copy of you editor for this.

          Other  viruses  include  MAC, AMIGA, and many other environments.
     By  the way, other computer systems other than IBM/DOS may become part
     of CPI if you qualify.

          Anyway,  these  are  a few viruses I have read on and thus passed
     the  information  to  you, I hope you can learn from them and get some
     ideas for some.

                         [1.4] Ideas For Future Viruses


          Since  I  have  covered  viruses  already in existence, lets talk
     about  viruses that can or may exist in the near future. These are not
     even   close   to   half  the  ideas  possible  for  destruction  with
     trojans/viruses  available,  but  will  pose as a challenge to you who
     are short of ideas.

          CSR  Virus  - A CMOS Stay Resident VIRUS that will implant itself
     in  the  CMOS  memory of the AT (286/386/486?) which will execute upon
     every bootup. This one would be VERY nice.

          Failsafe  Virus  - Preserves ALL attributes, Preserves file size,
     remains  TSR  but hidden to TSR location programs, Modifies attributes
     to  get  around  Read-Only  files, Infects ALL files (Not only COM and
     EXE),  encrypts  all  data  on  trigger  (irreversible)  but preserves
     original file size/attributes.

          Format  Virus - A virus which is TSR and when a DOS format or any
     other  FORMAT  type  of call is called, will FORMAT every other track,
     but will not allow DOS to notice.

          Write  Virus  -  A  virus  that  intercepts  write to disk, which
     deletes the disk write, and marks sector as bad at write point.

          ASCII  Virus  -  Virus that would scramble ASCII text in any file
     at trigger.

          Low  Level  Format  Virus  -  Virus  that  low level formats (BAD
     format)  HD  in background with data still intact. I have seen regular
     background  LLF  programs,  and it keeps data in place, but it does it
     correctly... hmmm...?

          Hide Virus - A Virus that hides files slowly.

          Crash  Virus - Virus that emulates typical system crashes/freezes
     occasionally.  Causes  BIOS to freeze and write BIOS ERROR messages on
     screen.

          Modem  Virus  -  One  that  remains  in  boot  sector and TSR and
     monitors  data  from  serial  ports,  puts in "artificial" line-noise.
     NICE!

          These  are  just  a  few  I  thought  up... these could be really
     good... Think of some more and call CPI HQ TODAY!
