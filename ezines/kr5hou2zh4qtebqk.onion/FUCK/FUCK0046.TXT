  "Many people believe that 'Elite' Died in the 80's. I think that it has just
progressed. Elite are no longer scum. They are mearly BBSers that follow
unspoken Rules. They have different standards then the run of the mill BBSer.
The Following is a list of things that the 'elite' follow, without being told
to do so."                              -AW

   another.

"My definition of elite is someone who knows what they are doing on the 
 boards.  Not much else.  If you know the software, you know the posting
 etiquette, and you know the files, and you know the users, then you are
 elite."                                -Dam

 the file might totally shatter their whole entire image of themselves 
 and their little clan."                -Zen
