                  "CIA: Conspiracies In Action"
                  -----------------------------

        In order for nations to survive and remain strong,
    there are certain factors and institutions which must blend
    together. A nation must have a social-political structure
    and a viable, functioning economic apparatus to propel it
    forward. The foundation for the United States is predicated
    on several variables, two of which are the Constitution,
    which is a "living, growing document" and an economic system
    based on free market principles, namely capitalism. For over
    two hundred years, both of these systems have functioned to
    create one of the greatest nations in the history of the
    civilized human race. For most Americans and people of the
    world, the premise of American democracy is based on a
    government run by the consent of the people. Our rights are
    protected by the Constitution, and the government itself
    functions via a system of checks and balances. Each branch
    of our government balances its' power through the others.
    But something unusual occurred after World War II. A secret
    or "invisible" government emerged from "the smoke and rubble
    of Pearl Harbor. It was still a child when the Cold War
    began after World War II, an adolescent during the 1950's,
    and it reached its majority a year after President Kennedy
    took office" (The Invisible Government, Wise and Ross, 1964)
    It is not a formal institution. In its present state
    it has grown into... "...a loose, amorphous grouping
    of individuals and agencies drawn from many parts of the
    visible government". This second unseen government is
    responsible for carrying out the policies (foreign and
    domestic) for the first or visible government.

        The primary function of the secret government is to
    gather intelligence, conduct espionage, and plan and execute
    secret operations all over the globe. It is not limited to
    the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), although the CIA is
    at its heart. There are nine other agencies that compromise
    the intelligence community. In no particular order, they are
    the National Security Agency, Army, Navy, and Air Force
    Intelligence, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence
    and Research, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation. The complexity and shadowy nature
    of the secret government is further insulated by individuals
    and businesses, some public and some ostensibly private.
    This organization is making decisions regarding peace and
    war completely out of public view. In fact, it is so
    secretive that few, if any, of our elected officials are
    involved in its decisions, and that includes the President.
    In effect, the United States has two distinct foreign policy
    agendas. One follows a public direction, which generally
    promulgates the altruistic myth of America as the good-guy.
    The other policy is carried out by the secret government and
    works in the opposite direction of the public policy.


        The premise of an intelligence gathering agency finds
    its inception under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940,
    when he created the Office of Coordinator of Information. On
    June 13, 1942, this agency was split into the Office of
    Strategic Services and the Office of War Information. The
    function of the O.S.S. was to gather information, but quickly
    expanded to include special covert operations, a policy
    still followed by the CIA. In September, 1945, President
    Truman disbanded the OSS. Four months later, he issued an
    executive order creating the National Intelligence Group
    and, under it, a Central Intelligence Group, which became
    the forerunner of the CIA. In 1947 the CIA was officially
    created by the National Security Act, and its duties were
    set forth in five specific areas, all under the auspices of
    the National Security Council. To simplify these five
    functions, the law appeared to give the CIA the task of
    obtaining, correlating, evaluating, coordinating, and
    advising the NSC. Today, the question is how could these
    guidelines be so blatantly abused? The answer lies in the
    "other functions" which the CIA may perform under the 1947
    Act. Because there is no specific provision for covert
    political operations in the 1947 Act, the NSC issued a
    "paper" in the summer of 1948 authorizing special
    operations. There were two important guidelines: the
    operations must be secret and they must be "plausibly
    deniable by the government."

       By 1951 the CIA merged and consolidated its power to
    the point where it became an operational and at times a
    policy-making arm of government, Truman was clearly
    disturbed by this diversion of the CIA, but it was during
    his presidency that the CIA began conducting special
    operations. In time, many citizens and Congressmen began
    questioning the actions of the CIA, but to no avail.
    Theoretically, Congress controls all appropriations to all
    agencies and institutions in the United States, but not to
    the CIA. In 1949 the Central Intelligence Agency Act was
    passed, exempting the CIA from all Federal laws that
    required the disclosure of the "functions, names, official
    titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the
    Agency." It gave the director of the Agency the staggering
    and unprecedented power to spend money without being
    accountable to anyone! The reasoning behind this Act was to
    protect the field agents. Without public access to records,
    vouchers, or expenditures, the identity of our agents would
    remain secure and subsequently so would our national
    security.

          Through the 1950's the CIA and the "invisible
    government" began to acquire unprecedented strength and
    further expand the scope of its operations. The emergence of
    the Agency in all of its size and power is directly
    correlated to the Dulles brothers and their relationship
    with the federal government. Uniquely, they embodied the
    dualism, and indeed the moral dilemma of the United States
    foreign policy. During the Eisenhower Administration, John
    Foster Dulles became the Secretary of State while his
    younger brother, Allen Dulles, formerly an agent of the OSS,
    became the first civilian director of the CIA. Between these
    two men, they shaped, developed, and implemented two
    distinct foreign policies. Under Foster Dulles the United
    States formulated its policy of containment, regarding the
    Soviet Unions quest to advance Communism. Publicly, the
    United States would never "adopt the evil tactics of
    subversion and secret manipulation practiced by the
    Communist enemy." In essence, Foster Dulles reflected the
    mythic America that Americans had grown accustomed to
    seeing, hearing, and reading about via the media. The CIA
    propaganda machine in conjunction with Hollywood movie
    makers worked overtime, consciously or not, to promote this
    ideal. American morality and work ethic was the epitome of
    all that was good and righteous; the world as we would like
    it to be. While he took this public position, his brother
    was free to deal with the realities of foreign policy. He
    was able to fight fire with fire. Simply put, overturning
    governments whether it occurred through economic warfare,
    coup d'etat, assassination, rigged elections, or even
    genocide was irrelevent, as long as it paralleled the public
    policy expressed by the State Department. The dark side of
    the government was in effect largely kept secret from the
    American people and Congress. Because of the relationship
    between the Dulles brothers, the natural friction between
    the State Department and the CIA never materialized.

         In order to survive, nations need strong intelligence
    services. But the idea that the CIA is primarily an
    intelligence-gathering operation is itself one of the
    Agency's greatest propaganda triumphs. Despite its name, the
    CIA's main purpose is carrying out covert operations. The
    Agency is also expert at distorting intelligence to justify
    its own goals. This disinformation leads to dangerous
    illusions amoung our policy makers. As long as the CIA exists
    in its present state, and there is no reason to believe it
    will change in the near future, our government can break and
    and all laws in the name of national security.


         Perhaps one of the most important of all operations
    began before the Agency was even born. Towards the end of
    World War II, many Nazi leaders recognized the inevitable,
    and began negotiating with the United States. These
    negotiations contained two areas of primary focus: surrender
    and receive safe passage to a neutral nation of their choice
    and the possibilty of waging a war against the new threat
    to the United States, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's
    emerging status as a super power created a "new world
    order"; a bi-polar world, and with it the onset of the Cold
    War. Both of the nations would follow a foreign policy
    designed to confront the other in every conceivable aspect
    of foreign relations. Sports, trade agreements, space
    exploration, the development of weapons of mass destruction,
    imperialism (some blatant, some clandestine) spheres of
    influence; the list is endless, and the regions of the world
    where the confrontations took place span the entire globe.
    BEfore World War II came to a conclusion, the United States
    and its allies came to comprehend this potential new threat,
    as did the Nazi leaders of Germany. What the Nazis had to
    offer the United States was a source of intelligence
    throughout Eastern Europe. As we know this region became
    the buffer zone the Soviet Union sought as compensation for
    its role in defeating Hitler's armies. The "iron curtain",
    as Churchill called it, would separate the democratic
    nations of Western Europe. The Nazi intelligence network
    was already in place and the United States recognized this
    opportunity.


        The man that put this operation in motion was an agent
    of the OSS, and future CIA director, Allen Dulles. In 1943
    he began secret negotiations with General Reinhard Gehlan,
    Hitler's Intelligence Chief for the Eastern front. When these
    secret discussions were finalized, General Gehlan was
    whisked to Fort Hunt in Virginia. His espionage network,
    which became known as the "Gehlan Org", would work for, and
    be funded by the United States. For almost ten years, the
    Gehlan Org was virtually the CIA's only source of
    intelligence regarding Eastern Europe. By 1955 it evolved
    into the BND, Germany's equivalent of the CIA. Many fled to
    Latin America to live lives in comfort, security, and to
    continue working with CIA linked groups.


        To ensure that Western Europe remained anti-Communist
    (although not necessarily democratic), the CIA organized
    secret paramilitary units, with hidden stockpiles of weapons
    and explosives. These units existed in Italy (operation
    Gladio, 1948), France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West
    Germany. Most were directed by former SS officers and had
    connections with an international fascist unbrella
    organization called the World Anti-Communist League. This
    organization was formed in 1961, and served as a worldwide
    network for extreme right wing militants. It boasts of a
    membership of extremely dubious and deviant groups. Former
    Nazis, Italian terrorists, Japanese fascists, racist
    Afrikaners, Latin American "death squads", United States
    Congressmen, and "former" CIA agents. In fact, this
    organization (WACL) played a major role in the internal
    affairs of Latin America. One of the more notable operations
    involved the assassination of El Salvador's Archbishop,
    Oscar Romero, in 1980. Romero wrote then President Carter
    regarding the numerous human rights violations occurring in
    his country. The murderous rulers, led by Roberto
    D'Aubuisson, an admirer of Hitler, orderered the hit. His
    party, known as ARENA, is still supported by the CIA and
    rules the country. Between 1979 and 1992, over 70,000
    "peasants" have been executed by the ARENA party.

         One of the more infamous operations occurred in
    Guatemala in the early 1950's. By this time, the Dulles
    brothers were firmly entrenched as the "czars" of American
    foreign policy. Both remained partners in the Wall Street
    law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. In 1951, Jacobo Arbenz
    was elected President of Guatemala by a landslide in a free
    and fair election. His primary goal was to transform
    Guatemala's backwards economy to a "modern capitalist
    state." The first orders of business was to appropriate land
    that was controlled by the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit
    Company, for which they were fairly compensated. This
    company was represented by none other than Sullivan and
    Cromwell. They immediately embarked on a propaganda campaign
    to discredit Arbenz as a Communist conspirator. The CIA
    conducted extensive propaganda operations and sabotage
    against the government. In 1954, unmarked CIA planes staged
    a series of air raids on the capital, dropping leaflets
    demanding the President's resignation. CIA-run radio
    stations warned of an impending invasion by a rebel army,
    who in actuality were mercenaries hired by the CIA. Arbenz
    fled the country and left Guatemala in the control of a CIA
    hand-picked "stooge", General Castillo Armas. Over the past
    40 years, various CIA backed regimes have murdered more than
    100,000 nationals in Guatemala.


         While in Latin America, let's examine some of the CIA's
    famous and less famous operations. In 1930, Raphael Trujillo
    took power in the Dominican Republic via a coup d'etat. He
    was enthusiastically backed by Washington for most of the
    next 30 years. Trujillo was totally devoted to the U.S. in
    the United Nations, and in return, the U.S. raised no
    objection to his methods of suppressing dissent - torture
    and mass murder. Throughout his years of rule, U.S.
    companies enjoyed a "favorable investment climate". By the
    late 1950's Trujillo controlled two-thirds of the economy.
    His incessant greed threatened the "favorable investment
    climate" for U.S. companies, and the U.S. government began
    to worry about a "Castro-type revolution." In 1961, Trujillo
    was mysteriously assassinated. His predecessor, Juan Bosch,
    was deposed by a CIA-backed coup, seven months after he took
    office. He was restored back to power in 1965 by a popular
    countercoup, only to be deposed again by a CIA invasion. A
    series of murderous regimes have maintained a "favorable
    investment climate" ever since, even while the citizens of
    this island nation suffer from acute poverty.


         In 1973, the CIA destroyed the oldest functioning
    democracy in South America, Chile. In 1970, a socialist by
    the name of Salvador Allende was elected President. The
    President of the United States, Richard Nixon, explicitly
    ordered the CIA to prevent his inauguration, and failed in an
    assassination plot. The CIA thus began a character
    assassination campaign to create a "coup climate". The CIA
    also orchestrated acts of sabotage, terror, guerrilla
    warfare, and arson. Funded by U.S. corporations with Chilean
    holdings, the CIA sponsored demonstrations and strikes. CIA
    linked media fanned the "flames of crisis". This barrage
    eventually eroded Allende's base of support, and, in
    September, of 1973, he, along with several cabinet members
    was assassinated. A military junta headed by General
    Pinochet seized power and began to purge the nation of
    radicals. Anyone who opposed his regime or was sympathetic
    to Allende was tortured and killed. Three years later, an
    exiled Chilean diplomat, an outspoken opponent of Pinochet
    (and the CIA), was blown to pieces by a car bomb. Orlando
    Letelier was not killed in Chile, but instead on the streets
    of Washington, D.C., U.S.A., along with his American aide,
    Ronni Moffit. CIA director George Bush told the FBI that
    there had been no Chilean involvement in these assassinations.
    But the CIA was quite aware of the fact that the Chilean
    secret police (DINA) had sent a hit squad to Washington.
    Soon after this incident, a Cuban airliner was blown up,
    killing 73 passengers. Investigators into the airline
    bombing found unmistakable connections to a meeting that took
    place between a "former" CIA operative, other CIA and FBI
    agents, as well as a violent group of CIA linked Cuban exiles.
    The bombing and assassinations were planned at this meeting.
    The CIA and FBI coverup is so complex that it is almost
    impossible to corroborate any reliable information
    regarding these incidents.


        One of the CIA's favorite hobbies was mind control
    experiments. Behavior control, as the CIA called it, became
    a great priority in 1953 (after the Korean War), under a
    program code named MK-ULTRA. This program was top secret and
    required the highest security clearance for anyone and
    everyone. Many of its files were destroyed when CIA director
    Richard Helms left his post in 1973. MK-ULTRA personnel
    (primarily "spooks and shrinks") tested radiation, electric
    shocks, electrode implants, microwaves, ultrasound, a wide
    range of drugs, and hypnosis on thousands of unsuspecting
    people. How they chose their "subjects" is so difficult to
    access that I cannot truly confirm all of the rumors I
    became aware of. Nonetheless, hundreds of prisoners have
    been used, voluntarily or not. During the mid to late 1950's,
    the CIA began to experiment with LSD. For many years it
    became the principle source of the drug in the U.S.. Some
    insiders insist that the "hippies" were part of their great
    experiment of the 1960's, but, personally, I think they used
    their own drugs on themselves. How else could you explain
    their bizarre behavior? LSD was also used on unsuspecting
    Vietnam personnel in the field. While in the field, I heard
    countless stories detailing these experiments. When I read
    "Jacob's Ladder", I was truly shocked, but it only
    confirmed what I thought to be true.


         The mass murder at Jonestown, Guyana in 1978 was
    actually the culmination of a massive CIA behavior
    experiment. Although reports of the incident referred to it
    as a "mass suicide", there is a lot of evidence that it was
    indeed mass murder. The coroner's report states that the 913
    victims didn't drink cyanide laced Kool-Aid. Almost 90% of
    the victims received lethal injection, while the rest were
    shot. Cult leader Jim Jones had a long affiliation to the
    CIA. When he formed his People's temple in Ukiah,
    California, he engaged his people to infiltrate
    organizations of liberal politicians. San Francisco Mayor
    George Mascone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated
    a week after Jonestown. Both owed political favors to Jim
    Jones. When reports of murders tied to his temple began to
    surface, he fled with his flock to Guyana. The Prime
    Minister at the time owed his job to a 1964 CIA sponsored
    coup. People that survived Jonestown reported that it was a
    virtual concentration camp. Black cultists worked like
    slaves enduring beatings, torture, rape, and intense doses
    of drugs used in the MK-ULTRA program. When Representative
    Leo Ryan, a key congressional opponent of the CIAm arrived
    to investigate Jones, he was assassinated. Shortly,
    thereafter, the murders began. All of Jones' white
    lieutenants escaped as did hundreds of millions of dollars.
    Supposedly, Jones died, but no proof has ever been established.


        In 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew U.S.-backed Batista
    dictatorship in Cuba. He immediately closed down the
    casinos, brothels, and nationalized the entire economy. He
    put the Mafia and U.S. based multi-nation corporations out
    of business in Cuba. He made many enemies. Vice-President
    Nixon, who had longstanding ties with the mob, through his
    friend Bebe Rebozo, began plotting with the CIA to eliminate
    Castro. Both the CIA and the mob expected Nixon to be the
    next President, but JFK was elected instead. In effect,
    Kennedy inherited the Bay of Pigs operation, which he was
    not too fond of. Kennedy did not want U.S. military forces
    to get involved, just Cuban exiles. The CIA hoped that they
    could coerce him into using the U.S. military. When this
    failed, so did the invasion and the whole operation. The
    operation called for the Mafia to assassinate Castro at the
    same time as the invasion. It was poorly planned,
    uncoordinated, and poorly executed. Kennedy took full
    responsibility and this incident brought him to the promise
    of dismantling the CIA.


        The assassination of JFK in Dallas in 1963 was truly
    the culmination of a power struggle between Kennedy and the
    secret government. After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the
    relations between the two were quite frayed at best. Kennedy
    was perceived to be soft on the fight against Communism. In
    fact, prior to his death, he planned to pull out American
    military personnel from Vietnam, something the CIA was
    unequivocally opposed to. He fired CIA director Allen
    Dulles, and, because of the Bay of Pigs disaster and his
    brother's crusade against organized crime (Robert F. Kennedy
    was Attorney General), he was hated by the Mafia. The CIA
    and the Mafia had formed an uneasy partnership in their
    quest to kill Castro. Now, they shared a common enemy, John
    F. Kennedy. They began to weave an elaborate web of deceit,
    espionage, blackmail, and inevitably murder, after 1961.
    They stretched their reach of power to the very limits, to
    plan, coordinate, and execute the coverup of this operation. Lee
    Harvey Oswald, the supposed "lone gunman", was a pawn in
    their game of chess, as were countless others who were
    sacrificed in the name of national security. The list of
    players is literally a who's who if government operatives,
    Mafia heirarchy, businessmen, politicians, police officers,
    and citizens. The coverup is so extensive and complex that
    it is conceivable that we will never know the full truth.


        In another "assassination scenario", during the last
    few years of his life, Malcolm X did several things to
    antagonize the CIA. He accused the CIA of assassinating or
    overthrowing several third world leaders and their
    countries. In fact, he met with many of these leaders, who
    were only anti-American. He believed the CIA was behind
    the Lumumba assassination (Zaire, 1960), and threatened to
    officially ask the U.N. to declare American blacks an
    oppressed minority. But what scared the CIA the most was his
    radical shift away from the separatist, militant approach to
    a more moderate one. One week after his death, he was to
    have met for the first time Martin Luther King, Jr.. It is
    believed that both the FBI and the CIA had been spying on him in
    a coordinated effort, and government agents had infiltrated
    his group as well as the Nation of Islam. After his
    assassination in 1965, by members of the Nation of Islam, it
    was revealed that the conspiracy to kill Malcolm X also
    included the FBI and CIA. The FBI and CIA decided to reach
    out to the Mafia a second time, this time to plot the
    assassination of King. The plot, coordination, execution,
    escape, and cover-up that took place was a precision
    operation. The shooter, James Earl Ray, another "stooge"
    was connected to various members of all three of these
    entities. Again, we will probably never know the true story
    in this conspiracy or any others I have mentioned. Nor will
    we ever clarify Robert F. Kennedy's assassination. Like his
    brother, J.F.K., he wanted no part of Vietnam, which of
    course was unthinkable for the industrial-military complex.
    He pushed for equal rights for blacks and was despised by
    the Mafia. People that were among those present at the scene
    of J.F.K.'s assassination and subsequent probe were also
    present for R.F.K.'s assassination. Is it a coincidence?
    Maybe... But maybe there is a common denominator that runs
    through all of these events. The evidence is too strong to
    believe that the secret government does not exist. From my
    personal experience in Vietnam, I witnessed first hand how
    "the Company" or "the Agency" operates.

        By now it is apparent to the reader, of the extensive
    scope of power the intelligence community, and in
    particular, the CIA have. Long before the U.S. military got
    directly involved there, Vietnam was the CIA's war. At
    first, they waged a fully operational clandestine war using
    locals, mercenaries, and French and Korean soldiers. They
    had the largest "private" airline in the world at the time,
    called Air America, but this effort proved to be in vain.
    The only way to free the region of the Communist plague was
    to fully involve the U.S. military. To do this, they had to
    create a favorable environment both in the region and at
    home. They accomplished both. Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand
    were home to several large, very secret, military
    installations. From these "bases of operations", the CIA
    could monitor the activities in both the North and South
    Vietnam. Through a propaganda campaign in North Vietnam,
    over one million refugees were brought to the South by CIA
    ships and planes. In the South, the CIA created the
    appearance of a democratic government by writing a
    Constitution and installing Ngo Dinh Diem as President. When
    they no longer needed Diem, he was assassinated, as was
    J.F.K.. Following the deaths of both Diem and J.F.K., they had
    successfully created the favorable environment they needed
    to involve the U.S. military. Within days of the J.F.K.
    assassination, newly installed President Johnson reversed
    J.F.K.'s plans to withdraw all military personnel. The CIA
    then fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to
    the Tonkin Resolution.


         Even though the U.S. military officially took control
    of the war after 1965, the CIA was part of the decision-
    making heirarchy. Policy, logistics, strategy, troop
    dispersal, air attacks in both the North and South, and
    clandestine operations from Laos and Cambodia were all under
    the jurisdiction of the CIA. They even dictated to the
    military what to tell the U.S. media, who were stationed in
    Saigon. This war was to be the crowning moment in the
    history of the CIA. They finally had everything they ever
    wanted: a full-blown war, with all of the trimmings. They
    controlled every conceivable aspect of the war, until
    January 1968. By 1968, over 550,000 troops were stationed in
    Vietnam. This war had grown into the "career opportunity of
    a lifetime" for the military-industrial complex, military
    career officers, and the CIA. They could extend the war for
    as long as they liked, while millions of dollars of tax
    payers' money were spent. But in January of 1968, they made
    a fatal mistake. They failed to recognize the coming of the
    TET offensive. The TET new year was to be a temporary cease
    fire, beginning on January 31. But military intelligence
    failed miserably. Instead of a cease-fire, every military
    installation in South Vietnam was simultaneously attacked,
    including the U.S. embassy in Saigon. Saigon was where the
    U.S. media resided. The war, in all of its color, glory,
    death, and mayhem finally came to Saigon. Subsequently, all
    of this was brought home to the American public via
    television. The profound results of the TET-1968 changed the
    nation, the people, Congress, and the policy regarding
    Vietnam. It was now time to figure a way out of this
    quagmire. "Peace with honor", said President Nixon. From
    1968 to 1975, at the fall of Saigon, the CIA began to expand
    the war into Cambodia and cover its tracks in South Vietnam.



         When I arrived in the Nam in 1971, the nature of the
    war had changed dramatically. My primary goal in Vietnam was
    to survive, not to win the war. My first contact with field
    overatives, known as "spooks", came in October of
    1971. I was newly assigned to the 25th infantry Division,
    located in War Zone C, III Corps, An Loc, Co Chi Province.
    We were extremely close to Cambodia, and all of my op's were
    in or near Cambodia, along the Ho Chi Minh trail. My
    previous unit, the 9th Infantry Division, stationed in the
    MeKing Delta region near My Tho, had rotated home. I joined
    this new unit primarily because of my skills as a "pointman".
    Shortly after arriving at my new area of operatives (AO), I
    was approached by a "military type" (spook), to "volunteer"
    for a new unit. This unit was to operate in total secrecy from
    the rest of the Division. Out AO was in Cambodia, deep behind
    "enemy" lines. Our unit was to be affiliated with Special Forces
    as an "elite mobilized unit". We were initially divided into
    four-men recon teams to acquire extensive intelligence. Our
    information led to air assaults by the Air Force, Army, and
    Navy on suspected V.C. and N.V.A. strongholds. In time, these
    recon teams became "sniper teams" or "hitsquads", as we
    called them. Our targets and missions were always highly
    classified. We spent days and even weeks at a time on an
    operation in the bush. We were highly trained and skilled with
    each member a specialist in one or two specific areas. I had
    acheived the highest classification for marksmanship. My other
    specialty was with knives. I remained in Vietnam for a total of
    364 days, 14 hours, and seven minutes, to be exact. I
    participated in countless numbers of missions, all of which
    were covert in nature, and answered only to the field
    operatives running these missions. When my tour of duty was
    up, I flatly refused to re-up (re-enlist), and my future
    became rather tenuous with the Army. I have run into
    countless problems and difficulties with the V.A. and the
    Army, since I left in 1972, but that is another story!
