                                Defcon ][
                                ---------

        Note: This is a story/narration about my trip to Defcon II.
In case you didn't know, Defcon II(I won't include the 'II' from here 
on out, but this is about the second, not the first) is a convention 
held for shady characters in the computer underground. For this convention,
a few more people heard about it, and more than just hackers/phreakers
showed up. Speakers talk about H/P/A/V/C stuff, surveillance, the law
relating to those subjects, etc. Anyway, this is my story, told from
a weird point because part was written during the trip, part was
written after etc. It may be a little jumpy from here to there, but
I think it will be well worth reading. This file will also probably
end up being longer than most, but once again, well worth the time
to read. I should include some great information, neat quotes, interesting
facts, and other stuff. This file will also have a lot more humor,
and not quite as serious a theme as usual, but that should help to show
other kinds of people out there, and the culture they are in. W3rd.


        Since nothing exciting happened on the way to the airport, we
will begin this from Stapleton airport in Denver Co. The cast: Me (Dam)
and Morpheus. Destination: Las Vegas, Nevada. Why: Defcon II. (note:
I had never been to Vegas, but Morpheus had). This takes place over
Friday the 22nd, to Monday the 25th of July 1994. For historical type
purposes.

                                Day 1
                                -----

        We arrived almost an hour before the flight so we decided to hit
the arcade and kill some time. Lethal Enforcers was our game of choice,
and upon playing found out we couldn't shoot the side of the screen. If 
you haven't played this game, read on but know that you can't get far 
unless you can shoot the bad guys that appear on the side of the screen.
So we try to get our money back and the guy walks to the machine and keys
in a credit for him. (Note: This guy had a barcode tatoo on his leg for
some bizarre reason). He then points out that by standing the farthest
from the screen, you can indeed shoot the sides. I asked him to shoot
out a glass window on the very side of the screen and he tries once,
realizes he couldn't do it, then shoots a bad guy and keeps going. He then
pronounces the game fine, and leaves without giving a few credits. He
tried to social engineer us. Lamer.
        The first leg of the trip was from Denver to Salt Lake City, Utah.
As we took our seats, we figured we would be fortunate enough to have all
three seats to ourselves. Right before the final call for passengers, a 
lady came up and asked if the other seat was taken. I should have said 
'yes' but didn't think to since she seemed a normal person. Bitch. She
put her little daughter beside me and moved a few seats back. The girl's
father sat a few seats up, both rid of the brat. For over an hour and
a half I put up with this girl screaming, kicking me in the leg, and tossing
her doll around by the hair. I must say that during this whole thing 
Morpheus was a complete dick as he buried himself in earphones and cranked
the volume, oblivious to the brat and me being tortured. Maybe he was right
about me bringing my own earphones. Bastard.
        Utah was dull. A three hour layover promised to bore us out of our 
minds but we were a little more creative. First things first. We called 
everyone we knew back in Denver to remind them we were going to Defcon
and they weren't(thpptt). Distortion wasn't home for some reason(or asleep
probably) so no picking on him....yet. Rage picked up on the 17th ring
with a weak 'hello?'. Yes! We had waken him just to tell him where we were
and where he wasn't! 
        As is custom with me, I decided to wonder the airport and check
things out. Three minutes later we had toured a majority of the place so
we hit a small food kiosk. Morpheus decided to get a artsy coffee or
something while I insulted him. "Capacino drinking muther fucker" and
"artsy fartsy trendy faggot" were two of my better ones while he answered
"yes, whip cream. yes, the gnu artsy kinda beans." 
        Back to the gate we went, intent upon serving the rest of our
three hour sentence in hell. Well? What would you call three hours
surrounded by mormons staring at you. From here we hit a bank of phones
beside the gate liberating them of their 'US West' signs and calling 
people in Denver, again. Cyanide had returned to work so we chatted with
her for a bit, and made sure she remembered that we were not in Denver,
and that she was working the whole time. (Morpheus is gonna get it). 
J-man the Shaman didn't get a call from us since his number was unlisted,
but we tried. Good part is, he made it to the con after all.
        Time passed as I reread _Snowcrash_ and Morpheus listened to
some music. As we boarded the plane, I couldn't help but notice as people
pushed past me holding boarding passes numbered '117' and '138'. If you 
didn't know, Morris air uses numbered boarding passes like that, then
calls 'Boarding numbers 1-30' etc. I was holding 8 and Morpheus 7.
I also couldn't help but notice they didn't speak english as they bumped
by. One other note about Morris Air. Their symbol is the same symbol 
for Chaos. Seriously. And they also have really rad safety messages at
the beginning of their flights. 
        The next plane flight was a little different for us. We sat with 
our backs toward the front of the plane and faced three other passengers.
During the flight, we talked to Sheila who worked for the University of
Utah and had a slight background in computers. We talked about 'puters,
music, mormons, and other fun stuff. Come to find this 55-60 year old lady
professor likes Ministry and has an internet email address. We said 'elite'.
        Landing in Vegas was another first. I imagine that is the only place
where you walk off the plane and trip over slot machines. The ride to the 
Mirage(our spiff hotel) was enjoyable and as we pulled up, I realized how
rich some bastards must be if they could build a hotel like this. Anyway,
on to the con!

        We walked about three miles to the con(yes, we were at the other
end of the strip) but saw all sorts of neat stuff. Arriving at the hotel we
wound our way through the casino, up the escalator, and in the dark depths
of the convention center. A small gathering of shady characters were gathered
around. We registered, and started chatting with others. From 4-10 range, we 
actually bored as hell and didn't have any choice but to watch the wierd
flicks they were playing. That included 'Computer Warriors' cartoon, some
fucked up JapAp cartoon rated NC-17 that had these chicks getting raped
by 30 foot penises and all powerful demons.
        After the movie we found out that '20 Ways to Trash a PC in ASM'
had been cancelled because the speaker was either jetlagged or drunk. 
No one knew for sure, so we decided to leave and hope the next day would
be much better. Walking back toward the casino we hooked up with the 
TNO guys and started talking to more and more people showing up late.
We chilled in the con room talking to everyone filtering in and finding
out who was who. Then it happened. I spotted a fed. I quickly got Remj,
Morpheus, and a few others and we quickly cornered him. "What agency
are you with" was the first question out. That kinda established why
we had begun conversation. Here are some things about him we found out:
        - He registered as Sid Wilson, and registered differently at
          the hotel we were in.
        - He would not give us his name, company he worked for etc.
        - He claimed he worked in the private/corporate security field.
        - He had a BA from the air force, Masters from ASU, had been
          in the military, and had at one time worked with a gov agency.
        - He said it wasn't FBI, CIA, SS, or NSA, but smaller and
          just as private as the NSA.
        - He claimed he could walk into the NSA, and have full access to
          all of their computing power, because the NSA had certain interests
          in the companies he worked for. 
        - He said he had full access to FBI, CIA, and Secret Service records.
        - He said he makes between 100 and 250k a year. (elite)
        - He said he doesn't currently work for the feds, but occasionally
          they used him for resources(information primarily).
Every question we shot at him designed to trip him up he met with a good
answer and was cool under fire. Once or twice he slipped up on wording and
resulted in him sounding like he worked for the DOD or NSA(specifically
those two agencies because we were talking about them). Either way,
everyone agreed he was a fed. I received my 'I spotted the fed' t-shirt
and he received his 'I am a fed' t-shirt. Either way, he was extremely
nice, and even if he wasn't legit, really interesting to talk to. Just for
reference, he went into great detail about everything from surveillance to
lockpicking.
        During the whole talk with him(anywhere up to 20 people were 
listening at a time) we noticed a few others acting funny. Following
up on the registry, asking questions, etc, we determined they were feds
to. That put the ratio pretty high on us/fedz. One of them later was
counted as a legit fed spot(by me but I didn't get a second shirt -
your welcome Natex!). The night wound down and we headed back to our
hotel(walked three miles at 2:00 am) and paid a dollar for a coke each
before crashing.

                               Day 2
                               -----

        10:00 sharp, and we walked through the door ready for the next
day armed with little sleep, a lot of caffeine, and a bag full of goodies.
I quickly spotted the TNO booth and we went over and talked to DeadKat.
It took less than 20 minutes to pass out 40 of the 50 disks I brought,
each containing F.U.C.K. files 1-89 and a special word to Defcon people
only found on those disks(collector's file!). Of course, yelling out
that they contained everything from current 950 codes, Mastercard numbers,
fred info, etc made them go much quicker(good idea DK!). The first three
disks were handed to confirmed feds. H0h0h0. Wait 'til they read those!
        Some people of interest: Grayarea/Netta Gilboa was there. She
is the founder/editor of Grayarea magazine. I must say I was disapointed
as I watched her give out free mags to other people of importance, but
none to me, especially after I gave her my mag. :(
        Phil Zimmerman gave a speech about PGP(duh), and told about 
his past a little. All stuff we had heard with TNO when he talked to 
us months before.
        Gayle Thackery was next, giving a speech that somehow tied in
PGP to kidnapping. I am still trying to figure that one out. She was
also the butt of several jokes later, but all in jest. :)

        (This next part written while at the con listening to a speaker)

        As I sit here at the TNO booth, things are kinda mellow, people
taking flyers, asking questions, meeting people etc. A lot of big names in
the computer underground pass by, many in the 'PD' or 'Law Enforcement'
scene as well. Of all the groups that were represented, legal or not, only
one stood out in any way. TNO. At the table we have an old computer that 
will be given out later as a doorprize. People are messing with it while 
talking about how old it is, and whether they remember a computer that
weighed about 45-50 pounds(and it did). We are also handing out flyers
with Deadkat's and Agent 866's board advertisement. Telnet to 
'Corrupted.Sekurity.Com' and logon as BBS. Rad place to be sez me. Next
we were passing out a flyer showing the prime trashing areas in the 
Denver Tech center. We commented that they would make a great shirt, and
at the next con could probably hope to see those same maps for other towns.
Beside the flyers were business cards for Phil Dubois(Zimmerman's lawyer)
and his private investigator. At the table is a scanner monitoring hotel
security so we get the drop on them(snicker). This is one social gathering
from hell in most of TNO's eyes therefore their laid back attitude.
Remj was wearing a shirt that is worth mentioning. Front said 'TNO' in
big letters, and the back said 'Fuck the Fedz' with 'No R3sp3ct!' under it.
Quite funny and great for walking through the casino.

        (end part written at TNO booth during con)

        Ate lunch after that with a number of people from the con. After 
eating the crappy buffet at the Sahara(where the con was) we talked
about several issues concerning copyrighting, encryption, and how to hack
the credit card keys they used for the hotel rooms. Natex by the first day
had deciphered the numerical code on the cardkey to his room, and figured
out how to re-write it so it could serve as a master key. Muhahaha.
Dead Addict, Juobs, Laughing Gas, DJ Ren, Root, Ezra, Bob, Natex, and myself
were present for this lunch. Hey all.
        We meandered back to the con and mixed with others, kind of getting
the feel for who was there etc. We had almost one more hour before the next
scheduled speaker. Morpheus found me and pointed out John Dvorak who had
just walked in. I thought it was kind of wild that he would show and headed
over to talk with him. First impression was that he was really laid back,
mellow, and just a good guy. Of course, I had to ask him some questions about
his book(_Dvorak Predicts_ by you know who). Since I was wearing a 'PRESS'
pass as well as my normal name badge, I decided to ask a few other questions
and told him I would relay the answers in this file to be. I asked him
two main questions. "In your opinion what is the biggest problem with Apple,
and with IBM?" He thought Apple had a lack of applications on the market
while IBM held onto a dead end architecture. True.
        Throughout the first part of the day we all noticed the decided
lack of codes at that type of convention. Dead Addict noticed the decided
lack of drugs. To each their own. :)  The night before I had traded 
a disk full of FUCK for a printed 'zine called 'The Barfing Yak'.
Pappy is the editor and I spoke with him for a little about each of our
zines and later that night read the rest of the zine. So I caught up with
him and complemented him on the Zine. It is well written, neato little
drawings, and good ideas. Call him at 800.221.3218 ext 269 for more info
on how to get it. Within a month or so they are planning on releasing
the zine in written and text format. As the mag says 'Yak on'.
        The next speakers talked about Surveillance and Anti-surveillance.
The presentation was quite interesting and here are a few things from it
I figured would be cool to relay on. Phones can't be secure no matter
what you do. You can not GUARANTEE your phone line is safe to talk on.
"Radio Shack is your spy store", And they showed it. The gave details
on monitoring people, finding bugs etc. The cool part is, most of the 
devices they showed could be replicated with cheaper parts from Rat Shack.
        Following the spy stuff, someone spoke on wire taps and other
legal aspects but told of interesting twists. I can't remember who
spoke, and for some reason didn't write it down, but two facts that were
told are definitely worth interesting. Both are based on fact which we
quoted sources for. 90% of all Law Enforcement wire taps are illegal. 
They are illegally obtained, tampered with in some way, or something
else happens to destroy their integrity. Check into it. Next was a
great statistic, and I think I got the numbers right, either way they are
close. There is a 22% conviction rate based off evidence from wire taps.
They cost around 65,000 dollars per tap and over 60,000 wiretaps were
used in 1992. You figure out how much they cost the taxpayers and tell
me if it is worth 22% convictions.
        It wasn't long before dinner rolled around(yes, that means not
a whole helluva lot happened) and a different group of us sat down and
ate. 'Repospaz' led the way to the Sahara buffet(sigh) and we grabbed 
a quick bite. Microsoft, CD Rom, OS/2, and security were the topics
of this meal. Since I was eating with one former employee of Microsoft,
one corporate security type person, and one other person that had a good
general knowledge of computers, it was quite interesting. The halibut was 
pretty good also.
        The wait after dinner was probably the most single interesting
hour of the whole con. Someone else(Frosty I believe) popped in a self
mixed tape from hell. It started out with some porn action. Then flipped
to the animations of the wall. Back to porn, then to Lawn Mower Man,
back to porn, to Minds Eye, back to porn, etc. To top that off, each
porn scene was edited as well. Keep in mind, when I say back to, it went
one frame of one topic to split second to the next, no static, no noise,
instant jump. Anyway, the porn jumped from different people to different
scene just as well, so that you couldn't follow anything at all in that
video. I was told later that it had everything from a guy with a 2 foot
penis to a hermaphrodite(remember that word this time Morpheus).
        After dinner I discovered the best part of the whole building.
For only one dollar, you could get a bottle of Heinekin. Great price
for good beer(in my opinion at least). So Morpheus and I drank quite a few
that night, yet he didn't get quite as toasted as I did. While drinking,
we listened to Winn Schwartau give an impromptu speach on monitor surveillance
and how to build a cheap but effective device that could monitor video
output of lower screen resolutions. He mentioned a place called the
Spy Supply in Denver(just moved here apparently) and a number to reach
for more information about all of that. 617.327.7272  So give it a call if
you are interested in more info on surveillance of any kind.
        Next, 'Mark' gave an impressive lecture on hacking the Oki 900
phone, how he started, what you could do with it, etc. Needless to say,
it is probably the best phone to get if you are interested in hacking
cells. For more info he told anyone to mail info@nw.com and indeed,
they will send you a three/four page letter explaining where to get more
info on the subject. By this time I was quite drunk and headed back to
a friend's room so he could grab his notebook. I ended up getting three
Long Island Iced Teas. :) While I was gone, I was told that someone else
(Drunkfux I think) gave a little info about hacking Motorola cells.
        After we got back to the convention, listened to some more stuff
from various people and things kind of broke up. Party in 1790 is where 
things went. In the first half hour there were over 30 people in the room
piling on tables, beds, and wherever else they could sit/stand. The window
opened all the way so fresh air came through(and that is a big deal since it
is against the law to have windows open more than X amount of inches -
because of suicide attempts). The party was great, Long Island Iced Teas
were mixed by a hacker who also worked as a bartender(yeah!). For a while
'Repospaz' was missing, and when he showed up, he told us he walked 
down to the casino, put three quarters in, and then showed us his back of
60 quarters. Must be nice.
        Other memorable things from 1790 that night. Didn't like the
rest of the drink? Just throw it out the window. We did. I remember
hearing this one: "I was like, three quarters of a way through the class,
and then I did some 'shrooms" referring to a college class. "..there were
dolphins in the mall..." and surprisingly, this had nothing to do with
taking drugs. Hearing all these great things I told everyone I was planning
on writing this file, and asked if anyone had any good quotes for the mag.
Here it is:

        "Don't spit out the high rise at the MGM"   - ???

        "Dvorak stole my Barfing Yak!" - Artimage

        "The only thing more fucked up than the Brotherhood of
         Railroad Signalmen, is defcon."  - Novacaine

        "And followed them was a pale horse, and upon that horse
         rode death, and hell followed with him."  - Jarik

        "Exile is too elite."  - Darkman

        "I have [a quote] on my computer, I'll give it to you
         tomorow."

Hope those mean as much to you as they do to me. :)

* Great shirt alert: "Toneloc - Over 5 Million Scanned"

        I left the party sometime after 2(i think), and found Morpheus
back at the convention room talking with more people about cells and
how to hack them, but we broke off and headed back to our room. This time
we took a cab.

                               Day 3
                               -----

        Winn Schwartau started off again with one of the best speeches
regarding new technology and today's cyberspace. He started out with
some basics, enough to get you in the mood and get you relaxed as he 
took you on a tour of "what we CAN do today, that you just don't know 
about". He quoted a movie near the start called _Prime Risk_ that I plan
on seeing pretty soon. From the sound of it, you may want to check it
out if you are interested in the following I relay on about his talk.
We have all heard of trojans and what they can do, and how dangerous
they are, but have you ever thought of a hardware trojan? Coding designed
in the chip, so that it is in your machine from day one? Think of the
potential of that. Later in this paragraph I will give you a book to 
check out, and it should tell a LOT more about these subjects, but this
will give you the gist. Herfguns and EMP/T bombs. Don't know if the 
'herfgun' part is spelled right but that is how it sounds. I have read 
a little on EMP/T to know they aren't 'Empty' bombs. Anyway, they both 
consist of ways of knocking computers offline as well as any other 
technical machine using the basic technology a computer uses. Weaker
devices of this nature will cause a system to reboot or something pretty
harmless. Bigger or more powerful weapons of this nature will kill
data on machines, cause all sorts of mayhem on the machine, and some other
stuff. He went on to tell how the media said a virus helped us win the
Gulf war, but in reality, well placed EMP/T bombs did it. From here
he broke off and started a new thread of conversation and had one good
quote in the middle of it: "In cyberspace you are guilty until proven
innocent". If you are in 'cyberspace' then you know the truth behind it
and what that means. The rules are different there. Some other points 
he made and backed up quite well were these:

        - Industrial espionage is up 400% in the last 6 years.

        - Espionage is estimated to cost 100 Billion dollars,
          creating over 3 million jobs.

        - Current U.S. policy encourages espionage.

If you want to know more about any of the above, Winn is the author
of a book called _Information Warfare_ available at Walden's and B. Dalton's
I believe. From his speech, and general attitude at the con, it is a must
get. If you wish to mail him with questions related to that, he can be
reached at P00506@PSILINK.COM . If you wish to know more about his background
I have some information, or you can mail him direct.
        After that great speech we got to listen to Phil Zimmerman come
back on stage and beg for money, software, and hardware to help fund
his new project, which is a form of PGP for voice conversation over the
telephone. If you are interested, mail him(get his address from PGP).
        In the near future should be some defcon scanned images, a good
amount of text, etc available on the net at various locations. I only
know of what is planned, so keep an eye out for it. (And pass this article
along too!)
        The best hack of the con was presented next. While a member of 
Defcon was walking through the casino the day before, a manager approached 
him and asked him about defcon. Most of us had adopted the standard line of 
"You ever seen _Sneakers_ and _Wargames_?" "Yeah" "That is what we do."
So this guy asks the hacker "Could you get me a list of Baccarat players
staying at the Sands hotel? The hacker said "No problem". The next day
the hacker handed the manager a list of 'players' in return for three days
comp at the Sahara. In case you don't know what 'comp' is, that means
his room, all food, and all beverages were paid for by the hotel.
The list of players included Gayle Thackery(mentioned above). Excellent
hack man! Two thumbs up.
        Dead Addict was next to hit the stage with his speech called
"Two Futures". He basically told us of two very real but opposite
futures, Utopia/Distopia. He told us about an 'Information Convergence'
that was likely to happen in one or both futures, and that the future
depends entirely on who controls the information. He reminded us that
'a paranoid person is one who is well informed'.

        Utopia                           Distopia
        ------                           --------
        End of limits.                   'Their dreams take place,
        End of patents.                   not yours.'
        End of copyrights.               Redundant/Suppressed research.
        Educational freedom

That should give you an idea what the two futures stand for and the
basics of what he was saying. Other things he mentioned to note:

        - "Television Programming" - That phrase is the absolute truth.
                                     Think about it.

        - "There will always be bugs in the future...at least as long
           as Microsoft is around"   This was said as his notebook beeped
                                     at him that his battery was low. :)

        - "90% of people have committed felonies in their lives"
                                     This is hard to believe, but make a
                                     perfect list of felonies described
                                     by law, and you will see that is close
                                     to the truth.

        - Hackers obtain info = crime
          Corporations pay/bribe for info = acceptable

        - Selective Enforcement is how the law works right now. It needs
          to change.

He concluded that hackers would always be around, "hacking to destroy
the corruption we perceive." This ended an excellent speech. During
his talk, he mentioned a book to check out, called _Shockwave Rider_
by John Brunner(i think).
        Mark Ludwig was next on stage, and if you don't know, he is
one of the biggest names in virus research/development. His talk was a
little chaotic as his points were not an even flow, but some very
interesting and valid points.

        - Is copying software stealing? Jesus duplicated fish/bread,
          so was he stealing from fisherman and bakers?

        - God made man, Colt made them equal. 

        - Authorities can't take our(hackers) tools of trade.
          1) Info
          2) Computers (cheap and readily available)
          3) Software (copied easily)

He mentioned one book that deals with keeping ahold of your money and making
it inaccessable to the government. Details are outlined in the book
_Offshore Nestegg Strategy_. You may have to contact Privacy Reports Inc.
at 26A Peel St, Groundfloor Central, Hong Kong to get it since the 
government has basically banned it here. Next, Mark gave out some awards
for the Virus writing contest which was kind of slow this year.
        Peter Baruk from the SPA was next in line(of fire :) ). He took
the podium knowing fully he would probably get taunted and provoked but
kept a good attitude through the whole thing. He basically told what the
SPA is, who it consists of, and what they do. Two interesting facts he
quoted: An internet site at MIT that had copyrighted software on it(warez!)
was estimated to distribute over 100 million dollars worth of software
in 2 weeks. Rusty 'n Edie's was estimated to distribute over 750,000
dollars worth in 6 weeks. This brought a question to mind, so I asked.
"How can you count that as a loss to the software company if that software
wouldn't have been DLed had it not been free?". I basically meant that
most DLing of software like that is because it is free. If it hadn't been
free, most wouldn't have been DLed. He never fully answered my question
but oh well. During his Q&A someone mentioned "Better dead than Fed".
We all got a good laugh out of that. After his speech I caught up with
him to clear one law up that I will pass along. It is a felony if you 
have over 10 pieces of software OR the software is valued over $2500 in
a 180 day period. If you have any questions about that, or anything
else related to the SPA, you can reach them at 800.388.PIR8 (neato).

Great shirt alert: "In this age of digital darwinism, some people are
                    1's. You're a zero." and on the back: "3133+3"
                    and " 'I only hack for money' - Erik Bloodaxe"

        A couple other minor speakers, the 270 meg hard drive give away,
and the convention was pronounced 'over' by Dark Tangent. DT was
the one who put this whole thing together in case you didn't know, and
deserves a tremendous amount of respect for it. Rumor has it he got stuck
with the bill for over a 1000 bucks to cover damages to the wet bar. If
you were there, and responsible for any/some damage, please get in contact
with him, anonymously even, and help him out. A Defcon ]I[ would be
nice. That wrapped the convention up, but still left a lot of people
with most of the night to waste as some of us planned on driving/flying
out the next morning. 
        After that, Morpheus and I went back to the hotel to grab a bite
to eat. Since we weren't paying for food, rooms, drinks, etc, we decided
to eat at this really nice Italian place. *Morpheus' step-father was
'comped' while we were there, thus, no paying on our part.* We walked
into the restaurant and were promptly told we could not eat there because
we were wearing t-shirts. He had on an Armani t-shirt while I had on the
more relaxed 'Defcon' shirt. We bitched a little that rules weren't posted,
bitched some more and left. The French restaurant next door would be good
enough. Low and behold we got the same thing there. This time, things
were different. From the front of the restaurant, we could see two
people wearing t-shirts. One t-shirt right in front of us was striped
but matched the shorts he was wearing. The other was a plain black
t-shirt. The manager dood told us that since it had a pocket, it was ok.
We didn't see it that way. Five minutes later we sat down and ate. After
our great meal(180 some bucks for the three of us - free) we headed
back to the Sahara.
        Room 1790 was the site of a small get together and a little drinking. 
Most of the drinks had been consumed the night before leaving a lot of 
vodka and a little orange juice. It went quickly. Goodbyes were said, 
drinks finished, last quarters were thrown into slot machines, and everyone 
parted ways. Morpheus and I walked back to our hotel. 
        I mentioned this above, but there is more to it. We stayed in
the Mirage. If you have never heard of it, it is considered to be the nicest
hotel on the strip by most people. One weird thing about it, is when
you are walking through it, you feel like you are in Big Brother Land.
Translated: You are ALWAYS being watched. I had heard about it before
arriving and had even seen part of their security setup on TV, but you
don't get the true feeling of how many cameras there are until you
walk through there. On the first floor alone where all the restaurants 
and casinos are, I would estimate over 500 cameras were watching. Each
bank of slots, each poker table, each hallway, each 'attraction', each
everything, and there would be a camera above you. Some obvious as hell,
some not quite so obvious. Places like the Mirage are prototypes of
what our culture will be going to. Everything you do will be on videotape
somewhere, stored on computer, even though you don't know it. Stickers
with the quasi-Intel logo were floating around but instead of 'Intel Inside'
it said 'Big Brother Inside'. Scary.
        The trip back was pretty uneventful: two planes rides, a car trip,
and some unpacking. Denver was quite the same as we had left it.

        Thinking back to the trip we decided to give our own set of
awards for various things at the convention. Here they are.
