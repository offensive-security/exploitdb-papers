HI@#$!#@!$#@%$#%^#%^$#!%!@#! Welcome to the first issue of System Failure.
We've spent quite a while making this zine and making it as informative as
possible. To all those who have been waiting for it for a while now: sorry for
the long-ass delay in releasing it. A lot of it is my fault (yeah, I'm a
flake), but some blame does go to others who were extremely late getting their
articles to me (you know who you are). Let me know what you think of this zine
so far, and please submit if you think we have a shot in hell of sticking
around. Find me on IRC in #rock or #peng (that goes for most of the writers as
well). FLAP.

<sargon> Set up a conf.
<sargon> Do a conf tonight.
<sargon> Go set up a conf.

        Are you sick of people asking for confs all the time? Are you the
person begging?? Here is an easy way to set up your conf, and it doesn't
involve credit cards, real inpho, or sacrificing sheep.

1. Find a payphone. It's not too hard. Most look like payphones, are labeled
"Phone" and have dial tones. It needs to be a COCOT though.. so not like
a US West or PacBell or NYNEX phone. Get the number to the phone before you
start.

2. Dial 1-800-232-1234

3. Follow this conversation:
Op : Hello, AT&T Teleconferencing, how may I help you tonight?
You: I'd like to set up a teleconference please
Op : Can I have the names and numbers of your party?
You: No, I'd like a dial-in
Op : Your name?
You: Diane Smith
Op : How many participants?
You: 11
Op : When do you want this for?
You: 8:30pm pacific
Op : Duration?
You: four and a half hours
Op : Can I have the number to your location?
You: 619-598-7128
Op : Alright, I'll call you back with the host and participant pins

4. Hang up. Wait for like 5-10 minutes. It's cool to have a friend with you
so you're not totally bored. You can beat up local shrubbery while you wait
or something.

Riiiiiiiiing riiiiiinng

5. Answer it. You're a company.

You: Hello, Datatek, how may I help you?
Op : Hello Diane, this is Mary with AT&T
You: Hi
Op : Your 800 number is 800-403-1021. Your host pin is 738 846. Your user pin
     is 539 427
You: Alright, let me verify those numbers. 800-403-1021. Host 738 846 and user
     539 427?
Op : Yes, have a nice day. Thank you for using AT&T

*click*
You: Yeah, thank you for abusing AT&T =)

6. Some important things to remember:
a. Don't let warez pups on. They'll tone it to death.
b. Don't give the info to people you don't know.
c. Don't call on the host pin from home.
d. Set the conf to run past 12:30 am so it autoextends.

Have fun.

                 How to Make Social Engineering Work For You
                 by Saint skullY the Dazed (ibaiba@dnsi.net)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
	Ok, so you're sitting there, wondering just how you can learn those
evasive little telco secrets. You've read every text file you can get your
hands on, but none of them cover things useful for your area. Well get off
your lazy ass and collect the info yourself!

	To get that ereet 0-day telco info, you have several options. You
can go to your local bell yard and do some looting/trashing. You can also
just try to figure it out on your own. But by far the easiest (And safest)
way is to Social Engineer the info using your phone.

	It's actually pretty easy to get a lot of telco info over the phone.
All ya gotta do is get your local billing office number. Let's say you want
to get your local CN/A number. You call your billing office. Explain to them
that you're So and So in Bumfuck, Egypt, and you lost the CN/A number for your
city. Here's an example. 

*Dials 1-800-244-1111*
*Punches in keys until he gets a live operator*
Operator: May I help you?
Phreak: Hello? CN/A? I need the name for 541-555-1212
Operator: I'm sorry sir, this is *some bullshit department*
Phreak: Ohh, I'm sorry. I must have dialed the wrong number. Just to make sure 
        I have the right number, can you verify the CN/A number I have?
Operator: It's 800-555-3333
Phreak: Uhh, yeah, that's what I have. I must have misdialed. Sorry for
        mistake.
Operator: No problem.

	Yes, it really is that easy. You can do that for other numbers 
too. CN/A, FACS, RCMAC (only if you're smart enough to know *how* RCMAC
works though). You can also pretend to be a tech from another area and 
tell them your local directory is outdated. Here's an example script:

*Dials 1-800-244-1111*
*Hits keys for op again*
Operator: May I help you?
Phreak: Yeah, this is Roy here in Boise, ID. My listing for the CN/A
        number for Oregon seems to be out of service. Could you please give
        it to me? It should be in your handbook.
Operator: Ok, the number is 800-555-6666
Phreak: Thank you
Operator: You have a nice day

	Sometimes they will act confused. Just insist they have the 
information you need and that it is in their HANDBOOK. If one operator is
too dumb to give it to you, just call back and get a different operator.
It won't work every time, but it should work enough of the time for you 
to get the info you're looking for. 

	Be sure not to make these calls from your own phone or one that can
be traced to you. If you do, make sure you op divert your call. To op
divert, you pick up your phone, dial the operator, and say "My 8 key isn't
working right, could you please dial this number for me?"  This will make it
harder for Ma Bell to track you.

                            The Defcon Experience
                        by Pinguino (pinguino@uix.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        In the widely accepted sense of the word, I am not a hacker. I don't
know UNIX as well as I do DOS. I don't break into systems. I don't crack
password files. I fit in the category as a person with an abnormally high
intrest in computing and telecommunications. As one who is not a regular on
#hack, #phreak, or #2600, I was unsure of who I would meeting or what to
expect.
        Tymat originally offered to take me to Defcon, and the offer was
extended by my good friend Teklord. Curious as a cat, I decided to drive,
splitting the chore with Teklord's friend and business associate Cheshire.
Teklord also invited this really annoying weird chick named Cathy, but I'm
sure she's described in other files. We also had to drive Tymat there
*getting him out of San Diego and removing him from my life* I invited my
friend Shadow Dancer to go. Teklord and his other friend HiVoltage flew in
the comfort and coolness of an airconditioned plane.
        I have the best of luck. My car ran out of gas in the middle of the
friggin desert, with the gas gage reading a good quarter tank. We walked
forever to a gas station in the middle of buttfuck Egypt, and solved the
problem with a nervous mindset.
        Las Vegas was nothing like what I expected. The glitter, the glam,
the lines of people... it was all a facade. Fake. A front for the greed and
corruption that makes only a few become wealthy and the many poor. It was
also way too hot (I thought that San Diego was hot) like the temperature was
120 average and 90 at night. Dust blew into your eyes, blinding you from the
glittering lights and forcing you to stop all activity to brush it from
yourself. Vegas sucks.

:p :( :) :D :) :P gUi H/\X0r! :) :( :D :P :) :( #etc..

        Las Vegas also has a rather large problem with SPAM (SYNTHETIC PORK
AIN'T MEAT!).  They were everywhere... and we only saw 5 cops the entire 6
days we were in Vegas, thats less than 1 cop a day.. and in a downtown area!
The SPAM there have all the power. I personally hate SPAM, it leaves a bad
taste in my mouth -cHeSHiRe!
**  **  **  **  **  **  **  **  **  **   **  **  **  **
        Defcon was a large banquet hall lined with tables and computers.
Hackers stood in groups, some looking quite confused. The next room was a
speaking hall with room for about 100 people. The actual convention was
boring, but it was the people who made it interesting. I met Holy Cow,
Steggan, BinHi, Elfguard, Tekgirl, Knarph, Lefty, Biohazard, and some others.
        We ran aaaround the hotel stealing phones and creating general chaos.
By the end of the week, there were 3 curtosy phones, 6 handsets, stacks of
level 23 room keys, free soda, and trashing treasure info. We had bought cell
phones and elite pagers (From Elite Cellular, $7/mo). We partied, beiged
multiple lines to the hotel rooms, and got harassed by SPAM. We trashed
Sprint and got caught by SPAM, so we left really really fast.
        At the end of the trip, Knarph had to carry a payphone out to the
parking structure. He accidently got off the elevator on level 2, where
Defcon was held. It was 5 am. We got caught by SPAM hardcore. They claimed
that the phone was stolen and what we were doing was wrong, even though Monte
Carlo phones were gold and white, and this one was a regular cocot.
Additionally, this cocot was from 714 (L.A., California) and 10 years old.
They took names and ID, and some of us got to leave. There was a guy named
Slappy whose parents got called in because he had lied to the SPAM about his
age twice.
        We broke into the maids room at the Monte Carlo. That was interesting,
since we didn't know if anyone would walk in. The carts had the keys slipped
under bottles of shampoo and stuff, and the walls were lined with interesting
things to steal. We couldn't get the room keys to work, but have some ideas
about reprogramming them <g>
        Even though a lot of bad stuff happened and Vegas as a whole sucked,
Defcon was totally worth going to. I highly recommend it, especially if you
want a safe place to just go agro on everything. It's an event that goes on
every year, where people with similar interests gather and share ideas. It's
a place where you can wear your Free BSD or Qualcomm shirt that you wouldn't
be caught dead in at school, and feel accepted. It's a place that wakes up at
night. It's a place where curiousity isn't condemned.

                     US-West Field-Accessed Service Tools
                       by Mr. SoniK (zigy@teleport.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        I first learned about Field-Accessed Service Tools (FAST) one day
while I was playing with a lineman's handset I had recently stolen from a Bell
truck. I was dialing the speed dial numbers from the handset's memory, and one
number that I dialed rang and asked me to enter a six-digit security code. I
was wondering what this thing was and what it did and who owned it. I figured
it was US-West, because I had stolen a US-West handest, but it still didn't
say what RBOC operated it when I called it. I tried entering random numbers
at first and found that if it wasn't a valid number, it would read it back to
me. At first I used this as a poorman's DTMF decoder to decode the rest of the
speed dials in my handset. After I had decoded all the numbers, I had two
six-digit numbers from the speed dial. I called FAST again and entered the
six-digit number, and BINGO, it was a valid badge number of a lineman. Now I
had to get past the second step to get into the system.

        One day I was bored so I decided to hack the FAST system, so I started
entering random six-digit numbers. I got one valid badge number by guessing
numbers, but since I was on my home phone, I didn't want to go any further.
Once I got to a payphone I decided to enter the password I had guessed, but
instead of asking for a password it told me that it had expired and I had to
choose a new one. One Major fault of the system was that it failed to ask me
for the old one before I changed it. I realized that this was a major security
hole so I shoved it into the back of my head to remember. Anyway, after I
changed some poor lineman's password, I messed around with the voice prompts.
I found out about all the neat stuff I could do, like change the status of a
cable pair and other neat things like make LFACS inquiries, which means
basically the same stuff as regular FACS offices but completely automated. I
decided I was onto some big shit and wanted to know as much as I could about
this thing.

        One day I got my big break when I learned that skullY, one of my good
friends from 541, had looted a truckyard a couple of weeks after I first
learned about FAST. skullY had scored a little peice of paper that had a neat
little menu thing that documented all of FAST's features. I was really happy
when he showed me this and I realized what it was and what the system was
capable of. The paper looked like a map of directories you might see on a
Winbloze 3.1 machine when you open the File Manager and get a map of the hard
disk's directory structure.


Field-Accessed Service Tools
Security Code: (6 digit Employee Badge#)
Password: (4-7 digits)
NOTE: Your first "Temporary" expired password is the same as your security
code. After entring an expired password, you are asked to choose a new one (4

FAST TIPS:
if you are entering variable-length data, like a cable name or your password,
you must end your entry with a # sign. If you are not asked to enter the #,
FAST expects a fixed number of digits (e.g. 3-digit area code or 7-digit
telephone number). Don't enter a # after these.

To enter one or more characters that are not numbers, press the * key then use
the following codes:

- =11, . =12, + =13, a =21, b =22, c =23, d =31, d =31, e =32, f =33,
g =41, h =42, i =43, j =51, k =52, l =53, m =61, n =62, 0 =63, p =71,
q =01, r -72, s =73, t =81, u =82, v =83, w =91, x =92, y =93, z =03.

Press * to return to number entry. For example, to enter the cable name IPG42,
you would press *437141*42#. You may hang up at any time without creating a
problem. Whenever you are given a menu of choices, pressing 9 will return you
to the main menu.

                           Everything in a Nutshell
             by Andrax (e-mail system.failure@usa.net to contact)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

        There are a good number of reasons that the human situation is
currently at its level of dysfunction, one is simply that we are too much for
our level of ignorance, but that isn't a problem, it's a symptom.
        We love to ignore the things which most affect us, in order that we
may pay attention to a mock-up of our idealized models of our view on a
situation. We look at the shadow of a facsimile of a reflection on reality
and apply it in such a way that makes it seem to be the all-important factor
of realizing our activities. So far removed from what is, we can alter our
perceptions to what we think should be instead. In this way we exert control
over all things. We see something how we believe we want to, and act upon it
accordingly. A fine temporary system, as, it allows for guidance of those who
do not understand the situation immediately so that there can be motion
toward the goal of those enlightened few who can control the masses, while
the timely explanation of the goal is slowly forthcoming as the activities
culminate. However, if the goal is too far, and the machine too large, the
explanation may never become apparent enough for the machine's little
individual parts to understand the purposes of going toward it, and the goals
shall change.
        This is the current state of existence that we as a species are
experiencing. The overall meaning of the system is so lost to its parts that
they can now actually quibble over where they think it should be put on
course for. The machine itself has awakened to its own very existence, and
like any of its parts, wants more than it needs, or even could have. It has
understood its own death, and that inevitability has frightened it, so it
clambers to escape its own ending, and we, being tiny far removed reflections
of it, and it, being a distorted abstract reflection of ourselves, do the
very same. That which we fear, we seek to disbelieve. If it is insistent on
making itself seen, we seek to destroy it, and it is this very instinct that
forms the system to begin with.
        The beginnings of society were much like an animal pack, the most fit
to lead naturally rose to the top and lead. The group needed a leader, not
because they were interested in following anyone, but because if everyone got
their own way, and many did, the group would become unstable with the
bickerings of it's members. If one member had an object, and wanted to keep
that object, and another also wanted the object, there would be a fight, as,
the extremely emotional nature of simple survival assures that those who act
in appropriate during a given situation are more likely to continue to exist,
and thus pass on their traits. Emotions were the simplest and probably
earliest expressions of the internal condition to even the least cogniscient
of conscious creatures. The dominant member was able to hold the most power
over the finality of the situation, however it may present itself. Often this
meant that the member of the pack who had the most highly developed system
with the most diverse capabilities, would, one way or another, become the
"Alpha" or leader of the group.
        It is this micro-evolution system that began the ever-diversifying
complexities of the social order. The more desire an individual has for some
object, the more willing they are to alter their level of complexity in order
to get that object. The more diverse your arsenal of abilities, the more
complex the order becomes. The human animal has risen to the top of the
species hierarchy, and within human society there is a steadily changing
complexity of hierarchy as well. The rich, charismatic, handsome,
intelligent, perceptive, quick-witted liar is the current top of the crop,
and it is the ultimate goal of this creature to do nothing more than
constantly gain power.
        It has become a desirable trait, in human society, to be able to
alter ones perceptions so that the system seems to be the devine object in
the semi-conscious mind of the individual. You accept your role and squeeze
yourself into the common mold that your precise levels of diversifications
are worked perfectly into it, that it may gain all or most of that
individuals powers over the world, and over other individuals. Nature
displays its most complex design in one of the simplest acts observed, and to
this I deduce, we can trust uniformity.
        Just as simply as all things seperate each other by order of ability
to manipulate, they also live and die. All things that are, once were not,
and must some day return to not being, as, it is the death of a thing that
allows, by evolution, the birth of the next. Also, as nature shows, that
which is the most diverse, and the most dominant, will pass on its traits to
the next generation. In this way, one day, the entire system will culminate
into complete efficiency, if nature is allowed to take its course. I, in the
natural cycle of things, and being a part of the nature machine, am terrified
of absolute efficiency, and wish to postpone reaching that point forever, if
possible, and if all else fails, destroy the possibility of reaching it at
all. To do so means stopping the machine by giving it a new task, but this
means I must ignore the truth of my situation, which, being a part of nature,
limits my diversification, thus disallowing the very thing I strive for,
causing myself to fail rather than the nature machine, it would beat me in
the very way I would beat it, ironically.
        Instead I must use its own fate against it. I have to accept the
impossible task of enlightening all the individual parts as to the goal of
the machine, and, ironically, have them split the machine apart in chasing
its own goal. For, if all the parts seek the goal of the whole, the spell of
the machine's existence is undone as it dies while passing on its traits in
the final feat of diversification. After that, it begins again, in multitude,
as the nature must do, else it never have existed. For, to thwart it is only
to default it. Pure irony.

                      Setting Up Call Home America 800's
                    by Dark Hour (darkhour@underworld.net)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        Making Call-Home America numbers is very easy. It's just a matter of
finding information and talking to an operator. You'll need a valid
name/address/phone number.  You also need an SSN, but you can make this up,
it doesn't have to be valid. After you get this information, call
1-800-594-3000. This is how a usual conversation with the Call-Home operator
goes:

Oper: Thank you for calling Call-Home America, this is Twee, how may I help
      you?
You : Yes, I'd like to set up an account with Call-Home America.
Oper: And do you have a Call-Home brochure?
You : Yes, but I seem to have lost it. I did, however, read all of the
      information from the brochure.
Oper: We can still set up an account..
You : Good.
Oper: I'll need your home telephone number, area code first..
You : Sure. That would be 501-834-2043.
Oper: And your name is?
You : Mike Hunt
Oper: Ok, Mike, and your address is?
You : It's 1721 ibaiba rd.
Oper: The city?
You : West Roy
Oper: The state?
You : Arkansas..
Oper: And the zip code?
You : 31337
Oper: Which major credit card would you like to place this on?
You : Would it be possible to direct bill?
Oper: Certainly, I'll need your social security number, for security and
      verification.
You : Sure. It's XXX-XX-XXXX.
Oper: I'll need to enter this information. If you have any questions, please
      ask.. <clickclick>
 [after a second or two you say:]
You : Oh yea.. I read that I can set up additional pins to other numbers.
Oper: Yes. I'll take those numbers when I'm done taking down this information.
You : I'll wait..
 [wait until she's done..]
Oper: Ok, I need the first other number, area code first..
You : Sure. The number is 501-794-0123.
Oper: I'll need a short description for this number.
You : Sure. That will go to a Chris.
Oper: are there any others?
 [If so, say yes, and give her the others. You can have up to nine.]
You : No, that's all of em.
Oper: Do you have a pen or pencil?
You : Sure. Here it is..
Oper: I'm going to give you your account number.
You : Ok, I'm ready.
Oper: It's 0202-XXX-XXX.
You : Ok, got that..
Oper: Here's your 1-800 number. It's 1-800-XXX-XXXX.
You : Thanks..
Oper: This is your home pin. It's XXXX.
You : Ok, got that.
 [The operator will proceed to give you any other pins you have set up.]
Oper: Finally, should you have any other problems, the customer service
      number is 1-800-594-5900. Your 1-800 number will become active within
      72 hours, not including weekends.
You : Thanks very much. You've been very helpful.

Note: Even though the operator says it'll be 48 or 72 hours, the numbers will
be up within 10 minutes of the completion of the call.


                             The Callnet Card
                             ----------------
        Call-Home America also offers a calling card, called the Callnet card.
This is a calling card, which also has some advanced features. Some of these
are news&weather, teleconferencing, speed-dialing, and message-delivery.
Getting the number is a two-step process. First, call the Call-Home
customer-service number, and talk to the operator.

You : Hi. My name is Mike Hunt. I recently set up a Call-Home account, but I
      forgot to tell the operator that I wanted to order a calling card. Can
      you possibly place the order for me?
Oper: Sure. How many cards do you need?
You : Oh, just one card.
Oper: I need your account number.
You : Sure. It's 0202-XXX-XXX.
Oper: I've placed the order. Your card should arrive within 7 to 10 business
      days.
You : Thanks a lot. Bye.
Oper: Thanks for using Call-Home America.

        Now, call the customer service number (1-800-594-5900) again. Make
sure you get a different operator. Your conversation should go something like
this:

Oper: Thank you for calling Call-Home America Customer Service. My name is
      Betsy, how may I help you?
You : Hi, my name is James. I ordered a CallNet card about two weeks ago, but
      it never came. Can I possibly get my card number?
Oper: Oh. Sure. Can I have your account number?
You : Sure. It's 0202-XXX-XXX.
Oper: Your calling card number is XXXX-XXX-XXXX.
You : Thanks a lot.. Have a nice day.
Oper: Good Bye..

        Should you wish to use your calling card, dial 1-800-594-5001. You
will hear one tone. Enter the number you wish to call. Next, you'll hear a
double-tone. Enter your calling-card number.


                           Flagged Numbers
                           ---------------
        If a number is used to many times, it will become flagged. Flagged
numbers have a tendency to go down. If you must set up a flagged number,
don't plan on your account being up very long. Below are some common flagged
numbers:

     Defcon..............(801)855-3326
     8 Ball..............(702)748-7448
     Hotel California....(607)252-6000


                                Closing
                                -------
        That's how to set up a Call-Home America number. Remember that
often-used numbers become flagged. I.E. You can set up a number to Defcon,
but it'll only stay up for ten minutes or so. If you have questions, comments,
or find any of this information to be false then email Dark Hour at:         
                       darkhour@underworld.net

                            Abusing Your Education
                        by Pinguino (pinguino@uix.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I've been in Journalism for years. I've been an office aide in High School.
Here's an easy way to get info if you get into those positions, or meet people
who are.

Most people don't realize that you can use the Journalism phone during school
hours from any classroom. Find an empty classroom and call the main office.
Look in the newspaper for a name, and then tell the person you're Blah from
the Journalism class (preferrably an editor that you sound like) and you need
to place a long distance call. They transfer your call, and only listen for
like half a second. If it's an office aide, they usually don't listen.

Both Journalism and office aides have free access to school info, which is
printed out. Every student. It's not uncommon to be missing a file. Nuff said.
These files have the kid's number and name, address, parents' names, parents'
work number, birthday, and social security number.

Office aides have it easy. After a while, the secretaries really stop watching
you. Secretaries are oftentimes clueless, and you have access to keys to
cabinets. I'm sure that a lot of locked cabinets have info, as well as
supplies.

Journalism kids can get mail sent to them. Just tell your editor that you
might need to get mail sent to the school cuz your parents are mean and look
through all your stuff.

Secretaries are notorious gossips. Good blackmail-worthy info is gathered in
the office while the important people are gone.

You can also steal passes to get out of class, and get people out of class for
"interviews."

My last year of school was soo cool cuz I was never in class, legit. =) These
classes can be pretty promising.

                         Preventing Computer Viruses
                   by Colaytion (civilwarfreak@hotmail.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        What is a computer virus? A virus is a program that, unbeknowest to
you, enters your system and begins to feast on the files you have worked
painstakingly to develop. To watch you computer slow down, get buggy, start
crashing, and then go kaput has to be one of the worst feelings in the world.
In the following article, I will endeavour to explain the virus, and teach you
how to prepare yourself for an eventual attack by one.

        Computer viruses and other malicious software all basically affect the
computer in the same way, and one must know how they perform this to get a
better understanding of what they do. Computer viruses affect computers by
first infecting the computers, and then detonating programs to cause damage.
The infector portion of viruses replicate so that they can spread via floppy
disks to floppy disks, or networks to networks. Viruses can only infect
executable programs or the area of disks called the boot sector. The boot
sector on the disk is the program and data area. It contains a small program
essential to the initial boot-up or login process of the computer. Executable
programs are those with COM, EXE, SYS, BIV, or OVC extensions. An example is
COMMAND.COM: the .COM at the end of the program makes it an executable
program for the virus. The detonator is the part of the virus that does the
actual work, setting the virus in motion and causing the damage. The detonator
goes into action once the computer is infected.

        The hardest part of dealing with computer viruses is not getting rid
of them, but preventing them. Viruses can be prevented by being more careful
with software and by using antiviral programs.

        Software management, more control of what software computer users buy
and use can prevent many viral attacks. Computer users should not use programs
when they do not know where they came from. It is the same as when your
mother tells you not to touch something because you do not know where it has
been. Use the same philosophy with your computer software. These programs
could be infected with computer viruses, and users should not risk getting
infected with them. In addition, computer users should not let others run
their programs on their computers, since users do not know where others'
disks have been. Such disks could have been infected in other computer
systems. Backing up hard disks and storing them in safe places is also a good
preventive measure. This can save computer users, because if their disk does
become infected, back-up disks will contain unharmed information that was lost
on infected disks. Generally, you should do a major back up of your system
once a month, and back up your important files at least weekly. These are just
a few of the numerous ways that we as computer users can protect ourselves
from getting infected with viruses.

        There are computer programs out there that can help prevent a user's
computer from being infected, and that is through antiviral programs.
Antiviral programs are used as preventive measures against viruses and gets
rid of them also. There are three different types of antiviral programs:

-  Infection prevention
 - Infection detection
 - Infection identification 

        Infection prevention programs prevent the replication process and keep
viruses from infecting the computer. Infection prevention programs remain in
the computer's memory at all times. They monitor the computer's systems, watch
for signs of replication, and check all requests for operating system
services. They even monitor the loading of programs in and out of the
computer's memory. In essence, virtually every aspect of the system's
activities is monitored and checked as it occurs. However, some normal
computer functions can cause some viral programs to think that a virus is
present, sounding a false alarm. Another problem with infection prevention
programs is that they cannot keep boot sector virus infections from happening.
Because boot sector viruses act as the system is booted up, the infection
prevention program has not even been loaded yet, and therefore is powerless.

        Infection detection programs detect virus infections, and identify
what specific area of the system has been infected. The programs identify
what specific area it is in by tracing the changes in the system made by the
virus during the infection process. The infection detection programs work in
one of two ways: through vaccination or through the snapshot technique.

        Vaccination works by modifying the programs in the computer to include
a self-test mechanism within each program. This self-test runs each time the
program runs and checks the program to see if any changes have been made since
the last time the program has run. If it is any way different a warning will
be given.

        The other way that an infection detection program works is through the
snapshot technique. The snapshot technique works by logging all critical
information in the system at the time of initial installation. Periodically, a
check routine is run and is compared to the original snapshot of the computer
system. If traces of infection are detected, the area of the computer is
identified and the user is notified. To date, infection detection programs are
the most protective guard against viruses. Norton AntiVirus runs in this
manner.

        The last type is the infection identification antiviral program. It
identifies the specific viral strain already infecting a system, and usually
removes that virus. These programs scan the system for the infecting virus
and, when the virus is found, it is tracked down and removed. However, this
system fails to keep up with the ever-changing computer virus field. Infection
identification programs just can not keep up with the number of virus strains
out there.

        All of the viruses that I have spoken about above are for PCs and
compatibles. You apple users don't need to worry to much about viruses,
because there are only about 5 known Apple viruses. This is because of how
difficult it is to program for a Macintosh in the first place. Unix users, I
have yet to hear of a virus for you, most likely because people who are using
Unix just aren't that kind of person and are usually quite intelligent.

        So, computer viruses and other malicious software can be harmful but
they can be kept under control if computer users take the time to find out
what computer viruses are, how they affect computers, and how to prevent them.
There are numerous antiviral programs out there and now many computers have
antiviral programs pre-installed when you purchase them. Antiviral programs
can be very useful, but can be used to their fullest only if users take the
time to prevent the transmittance of the viruses on their own. One must still
be careful with their disks, computer systems, and who uses their things, so
they will not be infected with computer viruses and other malicious software.
So remember:

YOUR DISK WILL BE MIXING WITH EVERY OTHER DISK THAT
HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THAT HARD DRIVE. THINK ABOUT IT!

                            Five-Finger Discounts
                       by Pinguino (pinguino@uix.com)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Old people clip coupons. Cool people get the special five-finger discounts.
"How do I get one? I'm ooberelite!" Listen, it's not as easy as clipping
something from a newspaper, or anything. There's a technique to it. We'll also
give you a list of easy stuff to steal.

The "Innocent" look
Are you young and clean cut? Do you wear tighter clothing than most people?
Take smaller items and pocket them, or hold them in your hand. When you snag,
pull the item from its wrapping. Slip stuff into your purse or backpack; since
you're so squeaky clean, you won't be suspected.

The "Bad Kid" look
Do you LOOK like a thief? You either need to have sleight of hand, or you get
to be the distraction while your friends raid the place. You can also go to
the less populated areas of the store, and fill your many pockets.  You 
might need to try to look like an "Innocent" kid as well.

The "I Belong Here" look
Going to a Star Trek con? Ren Faire? Those places always jack up the prices.
You and a friend need to dress up (not too well) and go to one, then have
your friend talk to the dealer (old Star Trek vs. new Star Trek or some other
hot topic) while you steal.

Barnes and Noble
Get books here. Info. Books, books, lots of books, and 2600! =) Slip them
under your shirt, front and back, and arms. Carry a notebook and put magazines
in it. Sometimes you can put stuff into a backpack.

I've been able to have a large book, put my notebook over it, and walk quickly
out the door. With B&N you sometimes need to watch out for those tags, they're
inside the book, and will fall out. Leave them in and the alarm will go off.
We stuck one to Insight's butt and the alarm went off, and the cashier looked
up and said "It must be your beeper, sir."

Best Buy 
You know, off the top of my head, I can't think of a better store to steal
from than Best Buy. They have small, easy-to-steal items that are worth a lot
of money. You can get a couple of movies, CD's, and N64 games all from the
same store!

One of the best things about Best Buy is they don't put those damned plastic
things on their CD's and tapes. There is only one security measure you need to
get past. On the outside of most all items at Best Buy is a small white
rectangle thingie. What you need to do is get a magnet. Pick up all the items
you need and head back to the refrigerator/kitchen appliances section (there
usually aren't too many people around here, you could also try the bathroom)
and rub the magnet on the white thing. Now you can walk out the door without
being caught by the false alarm things (I'm not sure about everywhere else,
but around here the alarm malfunctions often anyway, so what you might want to
do is buy a small item and walk out, the alarm goes off almost every time I go
through but I haven't been searched once).

Small, Independently-Owned Stores
This should be self explanatory. Unless you are a complete m0r0n you can steal
from these mom-and-pop places. They usually have no type of security at all.
Just pick it up and hide it. If you want, have a friend talk to the cashier
while you do it.

Natural Disasters
If you are ever in a store during a fire/earthquake/tornado, don't be among
the stupid little people running about. Use the chaos to your advantage. Grab
everything you can and run. w00p.

Sears Roebuck and Co.
Ok, what can I say? Sears, this 124 year old company, is a bunch of stupid
fucks. Most of the older stores have no cameras and no security. The new
stores have some cameras, but most (90%) do not have any kind of Gate
Security. All the glass cases (like in almost any store) are a sinch to open
without the key. There are two kinds that are mainly used. The first is the
one where the lock piece slides onto the rigid piece of metal attached to the
bottom inside piece of glass. On these, either get a good hold of the glass
section WITHOUT the lock on it, lift up, and take it out of the grooves. If
that's too hard, pull the one WITHOUT the lock out about 1/2 an inch and push
the other one in 1/2 an inch, then slide it open. For the ones where the lock
is built into the metal piece on the bottom of the glass, just do the same as
the last idea for the first kind. Pull one piece out, push the other in, and
voila, it's open. Also, If you find a register that is nowhere near anyone....
walk up to it, hit Return to get the screen saver off, then hit "5" (NO SALE).
When it asks for your Associate Number, type in "75" (this is a # that is
used by ALL sears nationwide). This is the one that returns are done on; all
the commission fraud happens with that #. Anyway, open it up and take the
cash. If you wanna have fun with phones, pick one up, hit 80, and start
talking (intercom). Here's how to crack the default code on all locked doors
(been the same at 8 Sears I've been to): there is a round circle of buttons.
Here is a ascii diagram..

                               X
                            X     1

                            1     2
                               
                               X

You hit both 1's at the same time, then while holding those, hit the 2, then
turn the diamond-shaped knob. Most of these are unlocked anyway. The cameras
you often see sitting on top of the TVs, displaying their output to the TVs,
do not record; these are measures employees use to see if managers are coming
down the halls. If you actually want to purchase something, always ask if
there are any returns or anything on major markdowns. Also ask if there is
anything in the stockrooms over 2 years old. The computers there mark down
prices every month. I bought a 32-inch TV for $200. Sears is an easy place to
fuck over. After ripping it off, get a job there.

Food
Well, if you live in a big city, as I do, you will never have to pay for food
again. There are over 300 fast food restaurants around Denver, such as
McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, and lots of place with a drive-up that are
busy as hell (most everything I say here works better if you go inside). For
McDonalds, You can usually just cruise up to the drive-thru, and say "I came
through here yesterday at lunch time, and I ordered a Arch Deluxe with bacon,
supersized. You guys gave me a Arch Delux without bacon, and didnt supersize
my fries OR my drink." And they almost ALWAYS say "Just pull up to the second
window, and they will give it to you there." Burger King and Wendy's are
pricks about this, so what you do is this: call down there before you go, and
tell the manager that same story, but dont say Arch Deluxe, becuase they don't
have it!@#@!# Hehe.. anyway, they will say just come in and ask for -manager's
name here-. Also, in your local supermarket (King Sooper's, Market Basket,
Gerbes), if you just need milk or something, go to customer service and say "I
bought milk here yesterday, and it tastes disgusting, so I threw it out. Can I
get that replaced?" and they will usually say "Go get another gallon and come
back here." You can also make up stories for bread and all perishable items.

Office Supply Stores
Not the small ones with like paper and stuff, think Office Depot and Staples.
Chances are, you really have never been in one, but they have a ton of cool
computer stuff. They have NO security. You can also get a large item and put
a receipt on it, and walk out.

Wal-Mart
You know those domes on the ceiling? Half don't have cameras in them (if you
look carefully, they have 2 screws) and half are real (4 screws). They go to
one monitor at customer service and the logs are kept for 30 days and recorded
over.
