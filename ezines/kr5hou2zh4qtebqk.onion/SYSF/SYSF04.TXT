Hi, welcome to the fourth edition of System Failure. I'll be your host this
weekend, bringing you alignment and proper punctuation to your zine reading
pleasure =) This month we will focus on a little something Alatar came up
with; the Winloop. We will also discuss new policies emerging in the computer
industry and government, and what you can do to help keep the privledges you
all know and love. Thanks to everyone who contributed.
    A lot of you are on computer security mailing lists, and might have seen
this sort of information float by. How many of you bother to take the time to
respond, to use your skills and place calls to your governer, or even e-mail
him? How many of you read the stale news articles written usually by clueless
overreacting journalists? Within each article there is a hint of truth, an
insight into the minds of the enemy. Remember 1984? Each year we are making a
move closer and closer to that state, though maybe not through a drastic
overhaul of the system operations. They're taking your right to encrypt, they
want to walk through padlocked fireproof steel doors. They want to monitor
phone conversations without a warrant. Their reasoning? Convenience to the
consumer. They will hide their motives behind slick marketing schemes designed
to awe the masses.
    Who are the masses? These are people who at home, use Apple IIe's and are
impressed. These are the people who see "Web TV" and are too afraid to use a
real computer, so they buy this to feel like they're a part of a global tidal
wave into technology. I didn't realise how computer illiterate the rest of the
US was until I moved to Denver.
    Since these people don't care about how the law can affect the future of
privacy, it's ultimately up to us to let the lawmakers know how we feel. Don't
be a jerk when dealing with them; that will only give people like us a bad
name. Use your intelligence and reasoning as a sword in this fight; if we just
get heard yet not listened to, its a step forward in the right direction.

      Background
      About This Alert
_________________________________________________________________
STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM BUILDING BIG BROTHER INTO THE INTERNET

In 1948, George Orwell described a future world in which Big Brother
peaked over the shoulder of every citizen -- watching every move and
listening to every word.

Now, in 1997, the FBI is pushing the United States Congress to pass
legislation which would make George Orwell's frightening vision a
reality.

Next week the House Commerce Committee will meet to consider a
proposal that would require all Americans to provide the government
guaranteed access to their private online communications and business
transactions.  Taking a page out of Orwell's 1984, the FBI-spawned
proposal would require that every part of the Internet -- from the
software on your computer to the network provider that carries your
messages around the net -- be jury-rigged to divulge your private
conversations immediately on request by the FBI (see below).

Unfortunately, this is not a work of fiction.

The amendment, to be offered by Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and
Thomas Manton (D-NY), is a serious threat to your privacy and represents
the first and final step in the construction of a National Surveillance
Infrastructure.

A vote is expected on September 25.  The future of privacy and security
in the information age is in the hands of the Commerce Committee, and
they need to know that folks are watching and care about the outcome.

On Monday September 22, please join thousands of Internet users all across
the country as we call on Congress to stop big brother.  With your help and
support,  we can ensure that George Orwell's 1984 does not become a reality.

All the information you need is attached below.

_________________________________________________________________

WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 22, pick up the phone and call as many of the four
   leading members of the Commerce committee as you can:

     Chairman Thomas Bliley (R-VA)         (202) 225-2815
     Ranking member John Dingell (D-MI)   (202) 225-4071
     Rep. Tauzin (R-LA)                    (202) 225-4031
     Rep. Markey (D-MA)                    (202) 225-2836

2. Ask for the staffer that handles the encryption issue.

3. Say that you're calling to urge the Congressman to pass SAFE (HR695)
   without amendments.

   Specifically, say that you "OPPOSE THE OXLEY/MANTON BIG BROTHER AMENDMENT.
   Americans should not be required to give the government keys to the front
   door of their house, and they shouldn't be required to give the government
   the keys to unlock their private online communications."

Other amendments may be proposed.  Please urge the Congressman to pass SAFE
"as is" and oppose any amendments. Feel free to use your own words though
here are some points you might want to stress:

- Oxley/Manton is a dramatic expansion of law enforcement power.  It would
  give law enforcement "immediate" access to private online communications
  and business transactions without any notice or knowledge to the user.

- Oxley/Manton is NOT A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY INTERESTS AND LAW
  ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS, as some supporters have argued.  It gives the FBI
  broad new power while stripping Americans of their Fourth Amendment right
  to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.

- Oxley/Manton would give the Attorney General authority to dictate the
  design of Internet services and software to suit the needs of law
  enforcement.

- Oxley/Manton would not stop crime. Strong encryption without "immediate
  access" features is available today at home and abroad.

- Oxley/Manton would increase opportunities for cybercrime as criminal hackers
  attack vulnerabilities in the key recovery access system.

4. Let us know how it went!  Go to one of the following web pages, depending
   on who you called, and tell us about the conversation.

      Rep. Bliley     http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=va07
      Rep. Dingell    http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=mi16
      Rep. Tauzin     http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=la03
      Rep. Markey     http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=ma07

5. Forward this ALERT to your friends and colleagues.

6. Feel good about yourself!  Know that you've stood up for privacy, and
   contacting Congress is more than most people take the time to do!

BACKGROUND

The House Commerce Committee is considering a bill known as the "Security
and Freedom through Encryption Act" (HR 695, a.k.a. SAFE).  SAFE would
encourage the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use encryption
technologies in order to protect privacy and promote electronic commerce
on the Internet.  SAFE enjoys broad support from Internet users, civil
liberties advocates, and over 250 members of Congress.

Last week, the Commerce Committee delayed its vote on the SAFE bill in
order to give the Committee more time to study the implications of the
Oxley/Manton amendment, which would change SAFE to ban encryption which
does not contain features that provide law enforcement with "immediate
access" to the plain text of encrypted information, including private
communications and business transactions (visit
http://www.crypto.com/safe_bill/)

The Oxley/Manton amendment would for the first time impose sweeping
restrictions on the ability of American citizens to protect their privacy
on US soil. Specifically, the amendment would:

* PROHIBIT THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS OR
  SERVICES WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE INSTANT ACCESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT: The
  proposal would prohibit the manufacture, sale, import, or distribution
  within the United States of any encryption product unless it allows
  "immediate access" to the plain text of any user's messages or files
  without the user's knowledge.

* GRANT BROAD NEW AUTHORITY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SET TECHNICAL
  STANDARDS FOR ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS: The proposal allows the Attorney
  General to set standards for what are and are not acceptable
  encryption products. The proposal's requirement of immediate access to
  plain text would seem to seriously limit the options available to
  encryption manufacturers seeking approval of their products.

The amendment does not specify whether the immediate access "features"
could be activated (or not) at the option of the purchaser or end user.
Nonetheless, requiring that such a capability be installed in all domestic
communications networks and encryption products is the equivalent of
enabling a national surveillance infrastructure and asserts unprecedented
control over the design of Internet software, hardware, and services.

The amendment is analogous to the government requiring surveillance
cameras in every new house built in the United States, which could be
turned on remotely by the police if you were ever suspected of committing
a crime.

Worse yet, such "key escrow" or "key recovery" technologies pose
significant risk to the security of the Internet -- providing new points
of vulnerability for hackers, terrorists, and industrial spies to exploit.
A recent study by 11 of the worlds leading cryptographers concluded that
the large scale deployment of such technologies would be too complex and
too insecure to meet the needs of an Information Age society (see
http://www.crypto.com/key_study/)

Despite widespread opposition from Internet users, civil liberties groups,
privacy advocates, and the computer and communications industries, Oxley
and Manton plan to push for this FBI spawned amendment at the Commerce
Committee vote.  If it is adopted, it would represent the first and final
step in the development of a national surveillance infrastructure.

Security 
   Paranoid People Live Longer

    Words to live by. Big Brother exists- He is watching, he is seeing your
every move. Some of you might say that I'm taking this to an extreme and that
no one can see what we do. Well my brothers they can; there is a program
called Look@me (1) This little program when run on your system and turned
on to send mode it will send out what you see in your screen to the net.
Now imagine Microsoft has this installed in every Windows distributed without
you knowing it. They can see everything you do. Remeber when Microsoft was
being sued for when MSN first came about when it searched your HD for M$
software and stuff? M$ also has WINS (2) which allows you to have a
Workgroup without have a LAN, doing it via TCP/IP and they are Inet
Workgroups. This has great possibilites. The Internet workgroup when I was
in a LAN i used to listen to mp3s on my speakers from my friends computer
across the hall and vice versa. We could also run program from each
others computers, but what denies M$ or any other person from accessing it?

What about TRW? Anything you ever do or ask about goes thru there and its
stored to use against you for later use. Its a great way to get info on
someone but your whole life is in there, everything you ever subscribed too,
any contest, its all there. Do we have any privacy anymore? We don't.

   Another thing that puzzled me is when i loaded up word97. It popped a msg
asking me if i wanted to update my word97 html authoring program. I was
like, how did it know it needed to be updated, i mean did programmers
set a date on the computer? That could be true, but programmers could have
delayed it or something, so the only likely thing is that word communicated
with M$ and got details and when i wanted to update it it asked for my info
and my program serial number. They could find out so much about you and if
you have a warez version of word that could get people in trouble.
Coincdence or infrigement of privcay?

http://www.winserve.com/

are running Netscape X.0. So everytime someone logged on the Netscape site, Netscape could have searched your computer changed things, took things or anything they want for that matter when you aren't noticing.
	What about TRW anything you ever do or ask about goes thru there and its stored to use against you for later use, its a great way to get info on someone, but your whole life is in there everything you ever subscribed too, any contest its all there. Do we have any privacy anymore? we don't.
	You may call me crazy, paranoid , taking things to an extreme, But i am just watching these things and say whats going on. Its right in front of us, i just see it and a bit worried about it. So just use common sense cause someone can be watching you, and when you least expect it they will attack.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
(based on the legal text on eff.org)

                                  A BILL
    To amend title 18, United States Code, to affirm the rights of
    United States persons to use and sell encryption and to relax
    export controls on encryption.
                         *title 18- criminal section of the Code

On feb 12 this SAFE bill was presented to Congress.
It made it legal to USE and SELL encryption programs, yet illegal to use
encryption to cover a criminal act. The fine would have been a 10 year stay
with Big Burly Bubba and his Butt munchers. This bill also created a loophole
for law enforcement and investiagors to bypass encryption.

                     AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 695
             OFFERED BY MR. WELDON AND MR. DELLUMS
              (House National Security Committee)

This was a revision which was worse for those of us with an interest towards
privacy and the first ammendment. Here it states that export of encryption
programs would be illegal, with some exceptions.

      From: Congressional Record: September 11, 1997 (Digest)
      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence: Met in executive session
      and ordered reported amended H.R. 695, Security and Freedom Through
      Encryption (SAFE) Act.

This was even worse, a substitute to the original bill.
It would mean that though public participation was voluntary, key certificates
and recovery systems would be regulated.
If your encrypted something to hide an illegal act, you'd go to jail for 5
years or get fined. The second time it happens, it's 10 years. You can't go
on probation for this (you evil hacker you <g>)

It would make it illegal to decrypt without someone's permission, and
impersonate a fed to get the key.

Encryption products would be sold through "Public Network Service Providers"
Big Brother is watching. It would be illegal to sell or distribute the
software.

Any fed has access to your file under this bill.

You want SAFE to be passed WITHOUT ammendments. The feds have given up on the
other two bills i described above. They want to put monitors in every piece of
software and on the net, the extreme of XBS's article. It's a virtual 1984
setting, but this is real life. It's not a book, not a game.

After you're done with the zine, please go and make sure you follow the
suggestions in the forwarded post from EFF.ORG about how you can help
protect the future of your privacy.

                    THE 'WINLOOP' DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK 
                       by Alatar (alatar@sekurity.org)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This article describes how to make a machine running Windows 95 restart itself
over and over again.  This is called a "Winloop" attack.  This has been
tested and works on the original release of Windows 95, OSR2, and Memphis
1416.  The drawbacks to this method are that you must have local access and
you must be able to edit the system registry.

Create a batch file.  In our example it will be a file named
C:\WINDOWS\WINLOOP.BAT

The batch file can contain any data in it.  In our WINLOOP.BAT example, the
batch file will consist of the following lines:

---BEGIN BATCH FILE---
@ECHO OFF
ECHO This computer 0wned by
ECHO Alatar.  To get your access
ECHO back, kneel and pray for
ECHO Jesus to forgive you for
ECHO your sins.
---END BATCH FILE---

Open the Windows Explorer and highlight WINLOOP.BAT.  Right-click and
select Properties.

Go to the Highlight tab and check the "close program on exit" box.  Click
on the Advanced button.  Click on the checkbox marked "MS-DOS mode".
Deselect the "Warn before entering MS-DOS mode" box.  Click on OK.  Click
on OK again.  This will create a file with the extension .PIF with the same
name as your batch file and in the same directory as your batch file.

Open the regsitry editor (C:\WINDOWS\REGEDIT.EXE)

Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE, Microsoft, Windows, CurrentVersion,
Run.  Create a new string value.  Name this string value anything.  In our
example it will be named "loop".  Right-click on "loop" and select
modify.  Under value data enter "C:\WINDOWS\WINLOOP.PIF".  You're done.

The next time the machine is rebooted, it will restart Windows over and
over again, in an endless loop.  The only ways to defeat this endless
restarting is to start in Safe Mode; delete the registry entry; delete the
batch file or the .PIF file; or reinstall Windows.  Since the registry key
can be named anything, you can call it VXD.DLL or something innocuous.  The
batch file can be buried deep in the directory tree, in some
important-looking directory. There is usually a /WINDOWS/PIF directory to
store the .PIF file in.  Of course, You can put these files anywhere you
choose.

Some folks might say, if you have local access to the machine, and can edit
the system registry, why not just delete the entire thing?  The Winloop
attack is much more frustrating than simply deleting the windows directory.
Your mark will spend hours trying to figure out why his system won't work
correctly.  Since the system will work when booting in safe mode, he will
ask his friends for help, call MS tech support, and generally spend waste
hours before giving up and reinstalling.  Or, he'll just boot into the
640x480x16 safe mode to use his system, which is annoying and ugly.

                       How to HARASS over IRC
                 by Klenzir (klenzir@hotmail.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Since the very begining, IRC has been the haven for people who dwell on the
confusion and stupidity of others. Around 60% of the people on EFnet have
been on less than 6 months, and on DALnet it's close to 85%. These "newbies"
are like small children. They will mimic what their idols do. Their idols
are usually the ops of the lame channels they hang out in, like #cyberchat,
or #chatzone, or #teenchat.
    These people are general nusances, but with the right techniques, you
can exploit them and use them for you'r own amusement. One technique to try
is joining some channel like #help, or #mirchelp. Wait for a line like "how
du u type in color ???????" which you can tell was typed by a lamer, if you
look closer. u=you, du=do, ???????=?. The apropriate response from you would
be to /msg them with an answer like " type what you want to say then hit F4."
This causes them to quit mirc altogether. It gives you a good feeling when
you clear out a channel this way.
    Another cool thing to do is steal nicknames. /msg someone with a line
like "you'r nick is about to expire. type: /msg probserv renew {nick}
{password}" Meanwhile make yourself a clone with the nick probserv. Now they
are partially ownt).
    The ircops are especially fun to harrass. It seems they are even stupider 
than newbies. Most of them dont even begin to know how to use the resources 
they're blessed with. That is why we must take advantage of them. Join 
#wasteland on EFnet or #dragonrealm on DALnet and give them a line like 
"there's this guy who's talking about my mommy!!!! please make him stop!!!"
Usually the lazy, ignorant ircops will tell you "ignore him". Just keep
rambling on and on. Ask them the stupidest questions that your mind can
conceive of.
    If you want it to get really fun then make a clone. use it to /msg the op and say " im gonna keep harrassing {your name} and you cant do a damn thing about it cause i 0wn you." IMIDIATELY change you'r name. start a /msg between you and your clone to with the clone making threats and you pleading for your life. Cut and paste this to the op to make it more convincing. Keep using 
the clone to taunt the ircop. and /msg him telling him that your clone 
keeps going, Bug him to make him stop. This will surely drive the ircop out
of his mind. A good example of this is the sportrider01 file on my site.
Two wonderfully crafted tools for harrassing people are gimp.exe and icmp 
bomber. They give the person you use them on a great lag or disconnect 
them from the server. 

Here's a little chart to help:
 ===================================================================
| SPEED of Ur MODEM | SPEED of the PREY's MODEM  |   CONSEQUENCES   |
|===================================================================
|    9.800          |   naaa just forget it      |      ...         |

|   28.800          |   14.400 or less           | LAG mayb Killed  |
|   28.800          |         28.800             |       LAG        |
|   28.800          |   more than 28.800         |     nuttin       |

|   33.600          |   more than 28.800         |     nuttin       |
|   T1,T2,or T3     |   less than a T1           |     killed       |
|   T1,T2,or T3     |   more than a T1           | LAG mayb killed  |
 ===================================================================

    A good way to kill someone with a better speed than you is to get a couple
of your leet buddies to icmp him too and all of it will kill him. That chart
is for the icmp floods out there. The way that icmp floods work is that it is
a constant flood on the person. With gIMP, you flood them til you find the
port that they're on and it disconnects them immidiatly. These are both great
progz to get and can be found at my site soon along with instructions to use
them. This is about all I could think of at the moment,so watch for another
article in the next sysfail.

Here is a list of people who we would like Mormans to visit armed with free
bibles. We didn't tell you to do this, if anything happens to these lovely
people it has absolutely nothing to do with us.

www.penguin.com - Just because =) (corporate bastards)

RMI.NET - shitty isp in Denver with completly clueless techs and admins.

VenusCam - got dogbert killed and caused Acr0nym to lose his job. This is
a priority for you to utelize your talent, but be smart about what you're
doing and don't get caught. They're looking for scapegoats.

Subject: Using minor status in scams

I just read System Failure #3 and had an idea for a minor contract scam.
When I was in junior high, one of my friends sent away for a"10 cds for a
penny" offer from one of those rip off music clubs.  After he got his cds,
and found out that he was supposed to buy six more at the regular price, he
contacted Columbia House and said it wasn't a valid contract since he was a
minor when he signed it.  They sent him a letter afterwards but eventually
they just cancelled his membership without him buying anymore cds.

The columbia house(columbiahouse.com) webpage now has offers for cd-rom and
movie club memberships so you could use this scam to get more that just cds.
                       -=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=- 
<pinguino> Columbia House is relatively easy to scam, lots of people do all
the time. I wouldn't be that daring just because you're under 18. In many
states (california for sure), minors can be charged as adults if committing
major crimes. Make sure you read up on similar cases in your state and see
how you can twist the laws to your advantage.
