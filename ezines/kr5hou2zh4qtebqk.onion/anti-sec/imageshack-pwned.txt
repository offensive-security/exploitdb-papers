	Anti-sec. We're a movement dedicated to the eradication of
	full-disclosure. We wanted to give everyone an image of what we're all
	about.
	
	Full-disclosure is the disclosure of exploits publicly - anywhere. The
	security industry uses full-disclosure to profit and develop
	scare-tactics to convince people into buying their firewalls,
	anti-virus software, and auditing services.
	
	Meanwhile, script kiddies copy and paste these exploits and compile
	them, ready to strike any and all vulnerable servers they can get a hold
	of. If whitehats were truly about security this stuff would not be
	published, not even exploits with silly edits to make them slightly
	unusable.
	
	As an added bonus, if publication wasn't enough, these exploits are
	mirrored and distributed widely across the Internet with a nice little
	advertisement embedded in them for the crew or website which first
	exposed the vulnerability to the public.
	
	It's about money. While the world is difficult to change, and money will
	certainly continue to be a very important in the eyes of many, our
	battle is that of the removal of full-disclosure for the purpose of
	making it harder for the security industry to exploit its consequences.
	
	It is our goal that, through mayhem and the destruction of all
	exploitive and detrimental communities, companies, and individuals,
	full-disclosure will be abandoned and the security industry will be
	forced to reform.
	
	How do we plan to achieve this? Through the full and unrelenting,
	unmerciful elimination of all supporters of full-disclosure 
	and the security industry in its present form. If you own a security
	blog, an exploit publication website or you distribute any exploits... 
	
	"you are a target and you will be rm'd. Only a matter of time."
	
	This isn't like before. This time everyone and everything is getting
	owned.
