At last the 2008 show! The torch-song no-one ever sings! The curfew chorus line! 
The comedy divine! The bulging eyes of puppets, strangled by their strings. 
There's thrills and chills and girls galore, there's sing-songs and surprises! 
There's something here for everyone, reserve your seat today!

We're happy to be have you back. Do we ever have some treats! We have some sweet
articles. We rm'ed g00ns, we took a successful forray into Anonymous' world, we
conquered and destroyed Blackcode, and, of course, we have the Cult of the Dead Cow 
owned and exposed. We top those off with lots of fun little owns and articles. Kick
up your feet and settle in, this is going to take all night.

/***********************************
*
* We owned Anonymous. Although they sell you the idea that they cannot be owned
* because they lack any structure, we owned anybody and anything involved that we 
* wanted to. They had a quote about being unable to kill a dragon with no head. We
* just watch the dragon stumble around drunkenly and then we stab all its toes.  
*
* We owned inky_'s main server, we owned partyvan.info, we owned a lot of people
* and sites that were not worth including in this article. The anon scene is massive
* and we owned whatever we wanted, and brought owns and lulz here for you. They get
* a lot of press and talk a lot of shit (fucking annoying ED pages too), but all
* they really are is the *chan community rebranded (currently) around the idea of
* destroying the CoS. ^ban^ basically says that if you are a channer, you're anon,
* and if you aren't, you aren't.
*
* A lot of the top guys have no respect for the morons dedicated to their cause,
* and don't mind abusing or misleading them (to which they so easily follow).  They
* don't mind money either, as we will demonstrate. Something stinks about this, it
* reminds me of *something*, if only I could remember what...
*
* The most talented people in Anonymous hack Scientology people. Think about that.
* In the hacking world, that places them below the people who hacked 
* ethelsflowershop.com and above the people who DoS specialneeds.com.
*
* We could be dropping your names, addresses, and email addresses, but you're kids,
* we do have some mercy.
*
* On with the show!

* Let's start it off with #el/i/tes

*/

^ban^ -> #el/i/tes: We are True Anonymous.
// And we are watching.

// ^ban^ is one of the big names in anonymous.. "old anon".. check out his
brilliant ideas!
^ban^ -> #el/i/tes: well, a suggestion for a board name
^ban^ -> #el/i/tes: I don't suggest we model after said board though
^ban^ -> #el/i/tes: http://4-ch.net/dqn/
^ban^ -> #el/i/tes: The Elitist Superstructure of DQN
^ban^ -> #el/i/tes: (The Elitist Superstructure of TPN you might recognize,
Nihilanth)

// ^ban^ had his docs dropped already, big drama

// And we finally know what old anon care about - money
Kerx -> #el/i/tes: So we're not gonna sit on asses and have yet another person
run our wiki and have him profit of us
Kerx -> #el/i/tes: time once and for all to buy own server and do our shit on
it and rent out space to make teh money
Freeze` -> #el/i/tes: and how would that work
Freeze` -> #el/i/tes: I'm all eyes here
Kerx -> #el/i/tes: just how the guy running anonhost is doing his
Kerx -> #el/i/tes: and we've got an easy way to secure money with the xenu
raids
Kerx -> #el/i/tes: make sure we have some true reps for the wiki go out and
collect in person also on next raid

// More money
Kerx -> #el/i/tes: ^ban^ we already has a way to get a ton of dough

// More money
Picatta -> #el/i/tes: and we're putting a couple ads on it

// More money
Picatta -> #el/i/tes: We could do a proxy list and put ads on it

// They are masters of technology and contemporary security issues
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: but we can't tell anyone
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: outside of this room
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: i was thinking about us getting a trojan
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: but modifying it
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: completely
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: until everything is changed to that virus scanners
wont pick it up
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: and distribute it to as many computers as possible
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: and take as much personal information as possible
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: and or hold the computers for ransom
Freeze` -> #el/i/tes: hmm
Freeze` -> #el/i/tes: if you could really do that
Freeze` -> #el/i/tes: I'd help out
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: the hardest part is to re-do the code on the trojan
TheShining -> #el/i/tes: and we'd also have to keep this secret until we had at
least 10,000 zombies

// omg anonymous revealed
031811:fuckingfruit -> #el/i/tes: he's waiting for kakama (the leader of
anonymous) to decide if to delete a wiki page or not

// Kakama's site and yahoo phish page: http://login.yahoo.890m.com/yahoo.html

// The illustrious ^ban^ explains that anon aren't hackers, they're channers,
and if you're not a channer, you're not anon
clorox -> ^ban^: you have alot of enemies...i am one of them
clorox -> ^ban^: you were a faggot when we first came here to me
^ban^ -> clorox: there's a pretty simple explanation for that, you know
^ban^ -> clorox: I was here when partyvan was founded, and didn't like the idea
of it abandoning the entire idea for it's founding :|
^ban^ -> clorox: The original idea was to have a network for anon, by anon, and
only anon
clorox -> ^ban^: what makes you anon
^ban^ -> clorox: but things didn't happen that way
^ban^ -> clorox: by anon I mean anyone from the *chan culture
// IF YOU WANT TO BE ANON CLOROX YOU HAVE TO BE MORE CHAN

/*****************************************************************/

Well, that was fun...

Remember, you are not as untouchable as you think you are. As long as you have a
website up somewhere or are IRC'ing on public networks (btw, do you honestly
think that EFNet provides a secure communications channel?) you are within the
reach of those who would wish you harm. 

To be perfectly honest, you indoctrinate your members just as much as the
supposed evil CoS that you fight against. I honestly don't see the difference
between your methods and those that you allege they use. 

Your actions are childish. You attack sites and people that have done nothing 
to you and whom you have no battle with. Hell, a lot of the time you don't even
attack the right target. That speaks volumes about your collective abilities.

Again, we beseach you to remember that you are *not* untouchable. While 99% of
the time you will anger people who have no power to hit back, or who have 
no friends with the ability to retaliate, the remaining 1% of the time you will
anger people who can and will hurt you.

Knock off this Chanology crap and go back to posting on 4chan and playing 
CounterStrike. You're in a world you know nothing about and you do not belong 
here.

We would have dumped your MediaWiki DB but it was full of crap and only had 32
registered users.

This was for you X. Hopefully it helps.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In any large hacking community there are two kinds of people at the top.

The first is not going anywhere. They are either unskilled (even for that 
level) and lucky to be there (probably there through patronage), or they are 
just happy with the benefits from being at the top of that level.

The second group is smaller, and contains a couple of people who have the 
talent, willingness to learn, dedication and time to move forward. There are 
a couple of those at g00ns, and we wish them good luck. Don't settle for being
 at the top of an organization that sells positions on a forum, whose 
competitors are The Defaced and The Regime. But you can't just look for the
 next cool hacker website, you dig? Try to find smarter people, and they
will not always advertise.

It's not over yet kids! Time for profiles!

"I'm planning on doing some irl raids myself here shortly. I think the target 
deserves to be targeted and deserves whatever actions come out of it. I don't
 understand the current direction the raid is taking look if you are going to
 spread documents and call it a raid i think thats rather ridiculous there are
 thousands of other sites that do that already. Words are for Discourse Violence
 is for Change, look its tough to even type this but paper airplanes don't 
change anything...they don't they just don't. If you make a paper airplane and
 hand it off to people and try to show them information nothing will change. 
What changes things are when airplanes crash into shit and do damage, that is 
really all today's world is about; the level of importance is directly related
 to the amount of damage something has done. Don't hand people paper...slam a
 fucking plane into a building and force the shit on them."

What's the moral there, that terrorism is an acceptable and admirable way of 
accomplishing your goals? CLOROX IS A TERRORIST WANNABE!!!! Hand the man a turban!

// g00ns is SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS
cloroxsecure (2:38:16 AM): if i see someone fucking around with the community
 we are going to expose them
cloroxsecure (2:38:25 AM): you were exposed

clorox -> Depravus: explain to me why g00ns are lame?
Depravus -> clorox: Personal army shit, internet tough guy shit, etc.
clorox -> Depravus: like?
Depravus -> clorox: Like typical 13 year olds that figured out how to use the in
ternet
clorox -> Depravus: first off none of us are 13 years old.... 18+  and most of u
s are older than that... secondly we are not anon we do what we want
Depravus -> clorox: Dude you don't have to be 13 to act like a 13 year old
Depravus -> clorox: You could be 49 for all I care
Depravus -> clorox: And that mentality is why you're lame
Depravus -> clorox: "We do what we want"
clorox -> Depravus: why do you think we act like 13 year olds
Depravus -> clorox: Which gives rise to internet tough guy mentality
clorox -> Depravus: do you not do what you want?
clorox -> Depravus: sorry we've pulled anon out of situations they couldn't handle

clorox -> inky_: milw0rm vmsplice

// ZF0 much help, great success!
Genocide -> clorox: i miss #irclogs
Genocide -> clorox: :[
clorox -> Genocide: ditto

Ok the real funny thing about clorox is his relationship with theswellseason (IRC whore).
The entire time they were dating she was flirting with other guys on IRC. The only guy
she didn't flirt with was clorox, who was too busy taking g00ns very fucking seriously!
She sure likes the attention she gets when she shows titties.

tribaL -> sCuZz: homeboys gonna get played like the rest
tribaL -> sCuZz: but you know hes not going to listen
tribaL -> sCuZz: not to me
tribaL -> sCuZz: not to you
tribaL -> sCuZz: not to z3r0

We present to you, the chronological IRC life of theswellseason!

crying. and I just sat there totally stonefaced because i knew if I said anything,

theswellseason -> sCuZz: clorox is going to kill me for telling you all this lol
theswellseason -> sCuZz: I'll give you noodz if you'll give me cock pics
theswellseason -> sCuZz: so that I can make clorox jealous
sCuZz -> theswellseason: i so know this is a setup
theswellseason -> sCuZz: how so?

// I just can't resist dropping any pm where someone begs someone to be private
theswellseason -> p00h: when the other guy says he loves me, I believe it
theswellseason -> p00h: I'm just scared that if I leave clorox he'll turn g00ns 
on me and get them to ruin my life
theswellseason -> p00h: z3r0 has threatened to do so if I hurt clorox
theswellseason -> p00h: that's why you cannot EVER tell him this

theswellseason -> p00h: I'm gonna try and back out peacefully
p00h -> theswellseason: it would be
theswellseason -> p00h: but if he knows it's for another guy, I'm done

sCuZz -> tribaL: and it just seems like shes being an e whore

theswellseason -> p00h: I've fucked a chick before
p00h -> theswellseason: but not with a penis
theswellseason -> p00h: well
theswellseason -> p00h: does a strapon count?
p00h -> theswellseason: no
theswellseason -> p00h: shit

theswellseason -> p00h: that's his IP
p00h -> theswellseason: how do u know
theswellseason -> p00h: because he just visted a page that I had set up specifically to get his IP
theswellseason -> p00h: the only other IP to have visited that page is mine
theswellseason -> p00h: and that's not my IP
p00h -> theswellseason: hehe

theswellseason -> p00h: I think you'd get in the room and like, cum prematurely
 from the nervousness of being around a woman like me


And this basically sums it up nicely...

sCuZz -> tribaL: lol she told me that when they broke up
sCuZz -> tribaL: he was like saying he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her


// pr0be //


tribaL -> nickserv: identify h4x0r!
pr0be -> nickserv: identify h4x0r!

For anyone who didn't know, tribaL == pr0be. He was too embarassed to carry on
 under his nick, so he concocted a stupid story and has been living it.

tribaL -> sCuZz: they think im from anonymous
tribaL -> sCuZz: i can't let them know im pr0be ;(

tribaL -> luna: switching from pr0be to tribal because of my dox

One common thread in pr0be's IRC messages is his (emotional) insecurity and jealousy. 
Always bitching about someone, like clorox.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the past few months, Alot of you have met the new guy tribaL. TribaL and i go 
back quite a bit, and he is the most trustworthy individual on the net that i have 
met thus far. 

The truth is, I have been training a replacement. I have been here for quite some 
time, and real life is starting to take over. With that said, it is about the time 
that i step down. 

I will not join any other crew. g00ns is and will always be my home, and if real life
 slows down perhaps i will be back. Most of you can contact me, but you know i just
 have not been online as much as i used to be anymore.

Respect tribaL, he is one crazy motherfucker. 

Later guys 

oh, and i aint gay.

God i'm going to miss this place so fucking much.
Just remember, Things aren't like they used to be. For the most part,
you are on your own. Watch your own ass, and do what you have to, to  
protect it. Even if g00ns were to end tomarrow, Nobody will ever be able 
to break our spirit. Nobody will ever be able to tell us we didn't own 
the internet. Watch out bro, And its never too late to get out while 
your ahead. People will listen to you - You have a good head on your 
shoulders. Maybe down the road we will start over, With all of the 
knowledge of our mistakes the first time. This isn't the end. Whoever 
attacks may win the battle, But they will never win the war. If g00ns 
shuts down, Its not the end. We still have our cliche- our group of guys 
that we will hang out with. We are smarter when it comes to getting shit 
done and not getting caught. We will prevail. You know if you need 
anything, i'll help you to my fullest extent. You're my homie.

Walk light, And keep your head on a swivel. Most of the people out here 
are snakes.

These kids are so funny.

Shortly before release (and long after we had taken anything we wanted from
 g00ns) we decided to have some fun with them.

Here are the IRC logs of us trolling and rming g00ns.net. A lot of others 
jumped on the troll wagon and everyone had a great time!

We fixed up the box a bit:

Fantastic, just FANTASTIC.

We were just jealous that g00ns thought of selling t-shirts before we did. 
Anybody want a "ZF0wned", "0wned by ZF0", or "Featured in ZF04" t-shirt? 
Look for them at a store near you!

Just kidding, we're not in it for the money. If we were, instead of making
and selling t-shirts we would make and sell CANVAS.

illmob was on the g00ns box, but they get their own article because they aren't
g00ns and we have a bit of material.

illmob is just a laugh no matter how you look at it. Never was taken seriously,
and it's claim to fame is ill[will] being imprisoned for selling Windows source
 code. Check out his legal papers and wikipedia article, name's William Genovese.

illmob didn't really get themselves owned, I mean they did not cause the g00ns
owning in any way. They weren't even a target, just a helpless battleground spoil.

Their only security mistake that lead to this was being hosted on g00ns. It's a
mistake nonetheless, albeit one they wanted to correct. It's not like they are 
really secure or anything, the webdir is basically a poorly managed file dump.

We found some funny quotes for you. They give (most of) these out for free in
#illmob, check it out for a laugh. They will probably be glad to have another 
channel member regardless of how you treat them.

Phist -> #illmob: [ill]will: I've just realized why nobody links to us anymore
and shit

coldblood -> #illmob: k r u really going to need that much sercurity?
padlock -> #illmob: Yeah, so I want to make sure we don't get owned stupidly
coldblood -> #illmob: yer that would be embassing if you did
padlock -> #illmob: Spyd3r is good at making sure the website itself doesn't
have a ton of holes, and I secure servers for a living, so I think we should be
able to handle it
coldblood -> #illmob: yer
padlock -> #illmob: Only ports open on the server are for services we'll use
padlock -> #illmob: And it'll be behind another firewall on top of that

Spyd3r -> #illmob: well we run well over 375 client sites from the farm
Spyd3r -> #illmob: only about 200 of those have the add-on that was used to get

Spyd3r -> #illmob: aye, I must give respect to "the g00ns"
Spyd3r -> #illmob: but individually speaking, there's a mean age of 17

To reduce our targets, we are enlisting your help to solve a problem for us. We
want you, the people of the internet, to take positive steps to reduce total 
contemptability. We offer some comments and suggestions in no particular order:

1. Don't be a dick. Alternatively, you could try getting off IRC, closing your
shitty website, and getting off the internet.

Go watch some TV or something.

2. Don't try to scam money out of the internet.

3. Don't talk to Phate.

Phate (ZF0wned in ZF02) sent us an IRC log of some guys dissing us. We're not
sure if the point was to let us know that random noobs dislike us, or to get
these people owned. All it meant to us was whether or not we should own and
publish them. We didn't bite. 

<sirukin> I better shut up before I'm owned.

That may have been said in full sarcasm, but do you really want to take the
chance?

Did any of you guys realise that Phate was actually going to email us that log?
Seriously, stay away from that treacherous owntard.

4. Do not pass Go.

5. Keep it real. Stick to what you know.

For an obvious example, Steven J. Murdoch (PhD student) of Light Blue
Touchpaper wrote a blog entry about how Google is an expert hash-cracking
machine. Someone with any real-world experience could have Googled right away,
or searched for the hash in one of many sites that store them, and found it
that way. Or used jtr, which would crack the password much faster than his
custom Python tool. Not to mention using a real wordlist - if whatever wordlist
collection you use doesn't have "Anthony" in it, then it is pretty worthless.
Starting by writing a slow program to crack MD5s against a wordlist, and after
futily failing in that regard going to the internet, shows that LBT has less
practical experience than the most inexperienced of script kiddies (which makes
sense, considering one apparently owned them). Yet instead of the stupid blog
revealing this to much laughter and humilitation, the internet seemed to like
the post and link it everywhere. Even Bruce Schneier was fazed by it. Way to
spread ignorance around because of the respect garnered by your academic
standing. Neither LBT nor Schneier were targets, it's just one simple example
for you.

<--- reality --------------------------------------- academia --->

6. Nobody cares about your blog, it exists only to occupy your time and satisfy
your feelings of influence on the world. The more flattering attention you
seek, the more negative attention you will get with it. You should probably
pack it up before someone owns your Wordpress and you have to make a post about
how you got pwned and try to pass it off as meaningless, plus display your weak
forensic techniques.

7. There's always someone better than you, so a little modesty is a good thing.
We aren't exactly great examples here, but nobody's perfect (yet). We're
working on the perfection thing, give us time. It's Operation Supermen, and in
case you were dreaming, there's nothing homosexual about it, faggot. :P

Somehow Thomas Ptacek found himself as the king of the security blog scene, and
eventually took this a bit far by blogging a paragraph on every fresh security
topic as if he was an ultimate authority. He wasn't exactly arrogant or unfair,
but gobbles took offense and smacked him down. Ptacek backed off and threw his
energy into Wikipedia, where he has made thousands of edits now. He's even done
some good work, successfully campaigning for the deletion of a lot of bullshit
"hacker" biographies like those on our Whitedust founders! He basically took
his authoritative position to Wikipedia, which is ok for now because Wikipedia
lacks anybody else talented to do that work. Currently it's just Myles Long of
CDC using his Wikipedia administrator authority to write a lot of complementary
articles on CDC members, so Ptacek is a welcome relief. (Ptacek and Matasano
were not targets, just examples.)

8. Similarly to #3, do not email us with taunts or insults. 

Maybe it's cool if you detail your fair opinions to friends, but if you just
ask us to own you, you might just get owned! Also if you run a website and you
do not want to be humiliated, do not let members diss us or others. Kids like
tripple generally are not worth owning, but Blackcode might be. Dig it?

We likes jokes though. Jokes > taunts. We have a good one about three g00ns
walking into a bar. :P

9. Do not have dynamic content on your website. You're probably not smart
enough and committed enough to secure it. Most likely nobody gives a shit about
it anyways.

10. Bugs Bunny is fucking timeless.

Well after Bambenek in the last issue im sure you will be delighted to know we decided 
we needed to own another whitehat blogger. This time it is Mr Bobby "Bologna" Lemos! 
Otherwise known as securityfocus' Robert Lemos!

Anyway, we mainly target these guys to publish the zine on their blog,
but here's a mini hax log anyway!

Superhacker Paul McCartney volunteered this tribute song. I actually thought it was
kinda crappy, but with all the effort going into it (he said he went back in time and
wrote it for us) we just couldn't turn him down. But when he started rambling on about
time warp I hung up the phone.

Don't Pass Me By
	- A Tribute to a FED

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more.

I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight 
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you 
Does it mean you don't love me any more.

Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so 
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

~

Paul's a hoot. A real nut.

Comodo is founded by "security architects" who have been in the business of
running ./nessus for years. Today they still run ./nessus for fun and profit
 but they also offer their "security solutions" world wide to over 200,000
 customers in more than 100 countries, securing 500,000+ businesses and 
individuals! Comodo - Creating Trust Online (TM).
 
They deploy ./security-solutions for a nominal fee so *you* can rest assured
that nobody will ./h4x0r your network. They can sell you flashy banners for 
your site which say "COMODO HACKER PROOF; TESTED $date" and "Identity assured 
up to $1 mil" Comodo is kind enough to let us download their "products" for
 free. Even though my windows VMware crashed when I ran both "Comodo 
Firewall Pro" and "Comodo Anti-Malware" I am assured those programs are 100%
authentic and hacker-safe, tested $date, and the best solution against evil
 hackers. Take the no risk HackerProof challenge today!

Once you have bought a SSL certificate from comodo and installed it on your
website you are assured that your site is 100% hacker proof and nobody can 
./sniff it. Because Comodo offers the *best* solutions, they run their own
 products on their corporate website and forum. Since they're the BEST, no 
evil hacker can compromise their server otherwise they'd have to give refunds
 to over 200,000 customers in more than 100 countries, securing 500,000+ 
businesses and individuals! And the flashy banners which said "HackerProof"
 are just flashy banners right?

== Call For 0wning ==

Yippie kayay motherfucker!

== Results ==

Once again we brought in the own. This time we had contributions. Two very
public groups provided some good owns/starts early after the ZF03 publication.
We eventually had to re-own on both cases but that was our fault for sitting on
them. We forgot to ask if they wanted credit or not. They probably do but
assumptions suck. I guess if they want it they can claim it and we will confirm
(or deny if some loser group poses) in ZF05 or on FD. 

As well, one unassociated individual did fantastic work nearer to publication.

Good work to all of you! We really do appreciate the help and take it into
consideration very seriously when judging or contemplating owning or helping
someone. Great to get some help and good to know someone actually reads this.
:p

== Next Target ==

Sorry. There is no target this time. There are a lot of reasons, but the short
of it is that there is nothing that really grinds us collectively right now.
We're also, individually, venturing into different hacking interests and
hacking side projects. This also means that the owns might be a little
different or more diverse in the next zine. We'll probably need a lot of
relaxing time before we can sit down together and go after a broad target. 

== Options ==

What should you do with your time, now that your CF0 target has not
materialised? Hack something! Don't talk about it, do it! And don't be like
g00ns, scanning for a set of shitty public RFI vulns and owning stupid websites
run by people who know nothing about technology. At least, not if you are doing
that just to support your hacker ego. There are good uses for random sites, but
if you don't have those reasons then just work on something productive. 

Try to challenge yourself, go after stuff a little more complicated than
before. Occasionally we see really sweet hacks happening, and we love it.

That's just our advice, don't take it too seriously. It's your life. Just
remember that it is what you make it.

== Before You Go... ==

That doesn't mean you can't send us stuff. We accept hack logs, articles,
accounts, warez, exploits, stories, tributes, etc. If we get truly something
awesome we could always publish it in ZF05 if you wanted and it was exclusive.

"Four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
 And though the holes were rather small
 They had to count them all"
                            - John "Spiderman" Lennon

Oh blackcode, between Milamber (see ZF03) representing your skillset and tripple
representing your mouth how could we not own you? Its just a shame I didn't save
 a certain thread in which r0xt3hwhatevers0x claimed the reason blackcode had 
not been owned was because it was impossible!

A little background: We saw Mil make a post on Blackcode saying it was just a 
couple accounts and his owning wasn't that bad. So for laughs we logged in as
him and posted our rebuttal. Tripple freaked out. Mil doesn't like changing
passes, even if we've displayed them in cleartext in multiple zines. The truth
is that he likes to be published because it gives him attention that he could
not dream about getting otherwise. That's ZF0's expert psychologist dropping his
analysis. 

No Mil, we do NOT have room for you to have your own article in ZF04. Now fuck
off!

So blackcode is another one of those kiddie breeding grounds. It seems these
days newbs either end up idling in 4chan or joining elitehackers/blackcode.
Blackcode have long been allied with tripple who probably openly admits to being
 the biggest bastard on the internet, and to his credit, he does keep most of 
blackcode's legions of kiddie drones in check. His skills as a Scottish
bastard (fact) aren't in question but his computer skills certainly are. He has 
nothing to back up his rants when the big boys come to town. He pretty much 
talked blackcode into being owned by defending his fellow lame friend Milamber.
 Tripple has achived nothing in five years at blackcode. He has achieved nothing 
but lived out the stereotypical scotsman's life. The problem is he is too soft
 to do it irl - he prefers the internet! And on the internet you need skills. 

Firstly, let's take a look at some "private messages". (BTW, don't miss 
tripple's "carding history" PM, it's gold)

tripple -> iadnah
Not sure who it is yet as I aint spoken to Mil. This site is not a target so no
need to worry about that.

##
# Yes tripple, because you issuing an open challenge for us to own you does not
# make you or the site you mod for a target :/ idiot.
##

lloth -> iadnah
Could you upload it somewhere below the public_html in my account on this
server?

As long as we get the admin passwords, we'll be fine. Then I'll dump the new
database and pass that along to you. Then let the fun commence. Razz

I'm hoping that some of the people overlap other forums.

##
# Oh how fun, Blackcode backdoor their own forum in a vain attempt to actually
# hack!
##

r0x t3h s0x -> iadnah
Not saying anything to tripple Razz He has no reason to be pissed about me
gaining admin. He'd only be pissed because of another tiff that had come up in
IRC (you've probably seen it on the boards)

Would just like to clarify that I had no malicious intentions when gaining the
powaz. It just started as a probe (first script was a "hello world") and then 
became "can I open files with this?" and eventually "can I connect to MySQL
with this?" and then fo` shits 'n' giggles I made myself admin. Didn't actually
use the admin powers.. except for when I locked that thread in the tutorials forum.

Aaanyway.. I'll speak to X and see where he stands.

##
# Lolz, hacked by one of their own mods. Sounds like eleet 0day techniquez too.
# :/
##

tripple -> iadnah
2 users of this site were arrested and computers were confiscated also. I think
its best that we keep a very close eye on the forums for now as no doubt they 
will be getting visits from law enforcement agencies. I spoke to X about it and
he seems to agree.

I cant names the members mate as much as i would like to tell you but i have
given my word so ill let them fill anyone in if they choose to.

I seen the post about IRC also mate, that will give people something to do
again.

Hows shit going now anyway?

# FUCK!!! RAIDED!!!!!

tripple->iadnah
I think him hosting the IRC could be a problem mate, I am pretty sure that
would still be classed as associating with known criminals, even though neither
of them have been to trial yet.

Thats fucked about moving your stuff etc. I could send you about $100, it aint
much but it will help.

I aint really ben up t much, just trying to keep my nose clean.

Saved the number in my phone so you never know, I might call one night but
beware the accent

# Tripple still didn't pay up for Iadnah's "services"
##

tripple->iadnah
Cool Ill call sometime in the next week or so then mate as Im working lates all
this week, reconsider the offer though as I know what its like to struggle and 
dont let pride get in the way of this ok, we have known each other a long time
now and I would hate to think that pride would get between us

# Phone sex

tripple->iadnah
I dont really have time these days to be honest mate, I got way to much on the
go right now. Got a few court cases coming up also so trying to keep focused on
them rather than anythig else.

# Tripple curb crawls hoes

tripple->iadnah
That kinda info is the exact kinda info that would net you a serious amount of
cash if it fell into the right hands BUT also a serious amount of time should
the law know about it mate.

The fact that you have teachers addresses, SS# and I will assume their ages, is
something that credit card scammers would love to have.

I had a scam going in a previous job where I would sell CC details to people
that could clone cards and im sure you can imagine what they did once they had
the cards.

If the daetails were to fall into the hands of someone like that then they
would pay quite well for it, provided it was enough info, when my case went to
court they estimated that I made around ??135,000 by selling the details alone
and that the people I sold them to made over 2 million from it, so im sure you
can imagine how much these type of people would like the info provided that 
their is enough info there.

# HAHAHAHA. Tripple you bellend. I hope you are in jail right now. Carding,

tripple->iadnagh
I already new those types of people mate due to the circles I mixed in before I
met my ex and had a kid, you might wanna try any local drug dealer, while they 
wont be of direct use to them (unless they have the facilities) they quite
possibly could put you in touch with someone, do use the kiddie dealers though
and be very carefull exactly what information you tell them you have.

You should be careful about making comments like this one:

So you criticize people about posting anonymously on forums and what not. Are
you not the exact thing you taunt? and if you are not afraid of saying who you
are i would enjoy the following information.

Your name:
Your Ip Adress:
Your current OS:


Your Name: James Showe
Your IP: 67.9.137.246
OS: Windows XP SP2 or maybe Media Center
Browser: Firefox 2.0.0.6

You live somewhere in Texas, I'm guessing near Austin.

Now, don't take this as a threat or anything. I'm really not an asshole, unlike
some people online are. I'm just trying to illustrate that unless you have the 
skills and forethought to protect yourself you shouldn't say things like that
to people who tend to take it personally.

You're right about the anonymous thing from your perspective, but what tripple
is referring to is a little different. He's saying that the zf0 people are
being 
anonymous in that they won't even leave anything like a handle or screen name,
so nobody really knows who they are. You have a valid point though.

# Iadnah bullying his members! :0

lloth->iadnah
Not sure if you saw it yet, but ZF0 3 is out.

http://milw0rm.com/papers/175

That, and (which is referring to the zf0)

http://blackcode.com/forum/index.php?t=msg&th=2128&s tart=0#msg_15399

Makes me think that we might be attacked next.

It might be a good idea to give the security of the site a bit of a tune up,
just in case.

Tell me what you think. If you need help with anything, just drop me a line.

We rm'd your site because you openly insulted us, that is not tolerated faggots.
If we're going to send a message then we might as well do it right.
Let this serve you a lesson. You don't want uplinklounge owned too right? 

$ mysql -u fud -p jdn52gj < drop
$ rm -rf bc

$ cd public_html
$ ls
scripts
$ echo g00ns > index.html
$  punt!

No, g00ns didn't actually hack something notable, that would have been more 
shocking than this zine.

~

At around 3:04pm EST today blackcode.com was defaced. Someone claiming to 
be "crolox" from g00ns came into IRC and claimed responsibility, but we are
not sure that g00ns had anything to do with this as of yet. We have some 
backups to restore from, but the forums and some parts of the download 
section may be lost. At this time we believe that the attacker(s) did not 
obtain a copy of our sql database, but if you happen to use the same 
password for blackcode as for anything else you may want to change it.

We plan to have the site back online on a new server, and with updated 
forum software, as soon as possible. Please bear with us. In the meantime 
IRC is still available.

We had this since zf03 but we thought it was a too shitty of an own to release.
However their shitty banner poked my eyes for too long on a lot of h4x0r sites. 
It took us less than two minutes to get command execution on their shitty 
misconfigured server. Even though we placed forum logging for usernames and 
passwords the list is too shitty to release. We had to drop their databases and 
hope they'll never return because all that shittiness is just excessive.

Ladies and gentlemen, and other esteemed members of our audience, tonight we've
spent some time looking at certain well known people in the security industry in
order to bring you a _very_ special treat -- the first ever ZF0 pwnie awards!!

It was very hard to narrow down the vast number of unwitting applicants we had, 
but alas, there are only so many categories. I'm sure that the others we
didn't mention can be awarded some sort of award in #phrack@EFNet or on FD so
they won't feel left out.

Aaaaannnnd now, the moment you've all been so eagerly anticipating, let's roll
out the red carpet and break out the theme music for our winners!

Firstly, in an ever popular category these days, We have our nominations for the
"Most narrowly directed researcher" award. The nominations were:
	1. kuza55 -- Some guy who presented at MS's bluehat conference about the
dangers of XSS. XSS effects us all, and we should all work to eradicate it by
writing a tutorial on how to exploit XSS vulns for our local l33t h4qr website 
and post a zillion and ten XSS advisories on milw0rm/FD/bugtraq a day.
	2. Luigi Auriemma -- A relative newcomer to the security industry, he
has never-the-less been extremely active in posting basic web vulns and easy
stack overflows against Windows apps on milw0rm and FD. I mean, there's nothing
like auditing five year old code that no one uses for strcpy() eh?
	3. RSnake -- This man again is well known for his XSS skillz. His 
famous XSS cheat sheet provides encodings for things like <, > /, etc in various
formats for people too lazy to code an ASCII/hex/unicode converter or too lazy
to run `man ascii'. A real winner. His web skillz are so legendary that he's 
spoken at many conferences and even has several blogs where he talks about such
interesting topics like CSRF (and of course XSS).

Ahem. And the winner is....... RSNAKE!!!! Congratulations Rsnake, you have won
the award for Most Narrowly Directed Researcher! If you'd be so kind, you can 
send your acceptance speech to our email address, superheroes@hushmail.com.
Oh, and if you'd like to add another award to your already vast collection,
learn how to use a compiler and you may get another pwnie, that of Biggest
Masturbator. Speaking of which...

Biggest Masturbator. This is one of the most highly valued awards because it 
means that the nominees are all far too busy getting their hax on to think about
having a sex life. *Ever*. Remember, these researchers are not a dime a dozen,
and each of them can do things that make #blackhats@EFNet members get hardons.
And, in no particular order, our nominees:
	1. Halvar Flake -- This guy is nuts. Literally. He's a giant with red 
hair who has been known to spend months auditing binaries 
(he's been known to work on a single binary audit longer than he has worked 
for one company). A true inspiration to all the kids torrenting IDA at this 
very second. We love you Halvar. 
	2. Mark Dowd -- Another super intelligent chap, this man was formerly
an ADM member known as Duke. The Duke later left his blackhat roots behind him 
and migrated to the nice sterile offices of ISS XForce. At work, he does insane
things like code Flash exploits that make Thomas Ptacek cum for days. 
In his spare time he hunts down integer issues in the Ruby interpreter. 
If anyone can find a way to make a computer suck a dick, this is the man 
to do it.
	3. Felix somebody -- Better known as FX, this German national beat the
living shit out of Cisco IOS; not once but several times. Watch out all you .kr
and .mx admins, this guy's packing more IOS 11 0day than RSnake can make blog 
posts in an afternoon.

And the winner is Mark Dowd!! Watch out guys, he'll be the first to create 
the legendary killer-sex-code-auditing robot.

For the category of Biggest Let Down there was only one real choice: rgod. I'm
sure that everyone by now knows that this .it kid is dead. Not even a suicide
note or a mad hax spree? What to waste a perfectly good exit opportunity. At
least g4y h1tl3r went out in style.

Blogs are very popular these days. Everybody and their intestinal parasites
seems to have one. Check out the nominations for Biggest Time Wasting Whitehat
Blog:
	1. GNUcitizen -- Everyone knows pdp. He loves to post info about CSRF
in SOHO routers and mass SNMP scans for the communities "public" and "private".
pdp is obviously a very skilled researcher and also happens to be able to write 
halfway decent English (which is an improvement over 90% of the Internet).
	2. ha.ckers.org -- Yup, RSnake again. He's a busy man. But how can you
say the words "blog" in a sentence without also saying "RSnake"?
	3. Matasano -- The hangout of Thomas Ptacek et al. This is a highly 
active community where you can engage in endless Internet debates about the 
"correct" way to check the return value of malloc(). Just talking about it wants
to make me visit!

And the winner is Matasano hands down!! Congrats guys! Really though, the other 
nominations are boring as hell and I never fucking read them. Matasano, on
the other hand, can easily chew up some hours you could be using to 
grep for strings like "strcpy" in C code (Luigi will be mad at me for giving 
away his 0day techniques).

Okay folks, that's all the time we have for tonight! Please join us next time 
for another installment of the ZF0 pwnie awards!

Oh, if you won, feel free to send an acceptance speech to 
superheroes@hushmail.com. If it's halfway decent we may even publish it.

Hey y'all... I didn't wanna raise a fuss yet on the general list, but there's
this asshole w/an ezine that's just issued a "Call for 0wning" against the
cDc (a sort of Gobbles/Phrack High Council thing, I guess).

Here's the 'zine:
http://exp.vip8.org/papers/175

I was hoping you guys could poke at our stuff a bit and make sure our ducks
are in a row?

Sorry this has happened - we try and avoid this kind of crap but I guess it's
bound to happen sometimes.

thx,
k3v



Hmm, philtered.net is in pretty good shape.  we don't expose much externally. 
 I will rotate some passwords though.

Did you tell Myles?

Adam


Yeah, Myles called me this afternoon - I hadn't checked the Sekrut forum in a
couple days where there'd been a thread brewing about it.  One of our NSF
kids in London got hacked by this guy first and he copied a bunch of his
personal email into the 'zine.  Bad stuff.

of registered users climbing up, about three-hundred within the past few days.
They\'re probably really bumming some SEO off of
cultdeadcow.[/quote:00243d938a]\r\n\r\nIndeed.	I need to go through and delete
these fuckers.	I do that about once per week, fun!'),

(2189,'b3bf87a14b','Actually, in all seriousness, I did have to fuck a cow. A
dead cow. It made me kind of nervous and sort of smelled bad, but it was pretty
hot, and I don\'t think that the cow minded much. It\'s really hard once
rigermortis sets in, because it is just not as flexible.'),

to figure out why ur ftp account doesn\'t work:\r\n\r\nusername:

(347,'f139ce7d58','Dildog,\r\n\r\nHeads up. Kevin directed me to you. I am
working on the next version of Torpark and the release of the new Torhawk. I
want to give back to cDc/Hackmo/NSF because I am about to monetize the
situation. This has become a trademarking issue. I want the cDc stamp of
approval, so I need someone to review it. Either to review the source code,
anon network, or both. And that means I need a dildog up in my ports. Ratte
suggested you were the man for the job. And if you weren\'t man enough, you
could suggest someone who was. And of course, this would mean some sort of fee
or percentage of net profits.\r\n\r\nLet\'s rap.\r\n\r\nemail to
arrakistor@gmail.com, or call me at +1.469.831.6648, but tell me the phone
number you will cal from or hack the  caller ID to say &quot;1337&quot; and I
will directly pickup.\r\n\r\nSteve'),

Ninja Strike Force

Wow, with a name like that you'd be forgiven for thinking that it is a ELEET
special operations team; members consisting of people with the same skill level
as a Bruce Lee / Schwarzenegger love child. They are, in their terms, the "mighty
 and the chosen". It's the Cult of the Dead Cow's most eleet of eleet! the cream
of the crop! the best collection of _hackers_ that they have collected.

"Membership in the NSF is granted by the cDc to those individuals who stand out
in their support of the cDc and its ideals. Members are recognized for their
abilities, capabilities, and being the best of the best in their skills."

We don't really need to rag on them, they admit that this sorry team of
self-obsessed bloggers is the best they have.

As you look a little deeper though, you figure out it's hosted by Flack. Now
Flack is an all-around nice guy, he can't tell a lie, he has no scene ego and
he isn't a hacker (he even admitted on their secret forum that his box is 
"probably" ownable). So why the hell would you host your stupid site on his
webserver, relying on him to secure your ninja stronghold?

Anyways we did own them, and here's their shit. Oh, before I forget, it's a
Windows box, so the hack logs might not be too great. :p

As you can see, there isn't much here apart from a WP and his hardcoded
websites and blogs. Typical.

We did manage to grab some oldschool mail spools for you though, so you can get
a feel for the day-to-day operations of cdc. This mostly involves talk of
secret handshakes, what to name applications, circle jerks....

Hi, and sorry for taking so long.

Hmmm. I'm afraid I can't say much about scr00gle, as I'm on Linux
and my vmware is broken atm (should be fixed these days though),
and also I couldn't find the SOURCE of this anywhere, it contained
just docs and an .exe. Are you aware of where to find the source of
this app, or would the author cooperate with us? As we'd obviously
need it anyhow :) Plus, cross-platform app capability might be cool, too.

i thought it was really good.  even though it's about 405, it relates
quite a bit to 806 (and many other area codes, i'm sure).  good work,
man.

Looks really good - totally dig the graphics and colors and ninja themed
stuff.	Quick work, too!  

Sorry, I've had my head down this week buried in trading stuff - difficulties
have arisen.  Myles can do adminy stuff better & faster than I can if you
need any of that.  Me, I just got opinions (ha).  

Anyway, looking forward to the other guys taking a gander at it.  I'm sure
they'll be stoked.  This a great example of what I'm the most happy to see
with NSF stuff - someone sensing a need and just filling it w/out a whole lot
of committee chatter and whatnot.  Awesome.

> What's the best way to title my app for cDc?

That's a really good question...

> Right now in the title bar I have: "batch-0-matic 1.0 - (c) 2006
Flack/cDc-NSF"

That looks good to me.	Including "cDc" is key, and including NSF
works, too; it'll help differentiate the NSF from the CULT, but make
it clear that it's still part of the overall cDc (because cDc <> CULT,
though that's the confusion).

As far as I know, there aren't standards for this stuff, though there
probably should be.  Maybe not put the copyright info in the titlebar?
 Maybe in an about screen or on a splash screen?  I dunno, either way
is cool.  We should establish some sort of uniformity to branding
cDc-related apps; since I'm lazy, I'll just declare that whatever you
do is the de facto standard.  Heh.

That's something that Mixter was working on/was going to work on; I
don't know the details about what all, if anything, he's done besides
conceptualize.	That's not to say that you shouldn't work on it; in
fact, you definitely should.  Proof of concept is a key point in
moving this forward, and this could be huge if we play it right.  I've
found, as I think you and I have discussed before, that lots of
cDc-related people are big on ideas and small on follow-through.  So,
yeah, go for it, then we can either fold it and Mixter's deal together
or we can call for help on yours or whatever.  Long story short, great
idea, can't wait to see it.

Sorry for the delayed reply, I'm really quite a slow ass.  I hope my
recent pimping of your book will help make up for my slowness.	Check
this out:

Cool, I just worry that I get overzealous about this stuff at times.
The app is still gonna come out, you've got my word on that.  Probably
Tuesday or Wednesday; I try to limit my blog posting to one per day,
and tomorrow's probably going to be the cDc book.  There are some
graphics and t-files and audio ready, too.  I'll hit G.Ratte' up in a
minute and try to get a firm date.

Yeah, I know what you mean.  I've gone through several periods of
loss-of-interest in cDc stuff.	I'm glad you're back, though.  It's
all about having people such as yourself that actually do stuff.

As for secret handshakes, that we do have (really).  Check this out:

http://www.cultdeadcow.com/pics/2006_defcon_14/Gratte_mudge.JPG

That's the first secret handshake; one person puts his/her arms around
another person with the hands in the position that Mudge's hands are
in, then the second person milks the thumbs as if they were udders.  I
guess it's not that secret, since there's a picture of it on the web,
hah.  There's a second secret handshake that I can't remember right
now.

Yeah, people come together around the cons and shit gets done.	In
between cons, though, not much happens.  We try to keep things afloat
with t-files and stuff, but the con-stuff is pretty much when it
happens.  That's not always true; Oxblood's got his stuff with the
Dalai Lama and whatnot that keeps us in the news (especially lately),
but for the most part, it's the silly hacker cons that are our "bread
and butter," doing-stuff-wise (and media-wise).  I guess it's because
we sort of a have a captive audience at the cons; it's people who are
definitely interested in our stuff, for the most part, and the media
shows up, too.	I'm not saying this is the way it should be, but this
is the way that it has always been, in my experience.

Yeah, cDc is not really a cohesive group with real goals or anything
like that.  It's really just a brand in search of a product; the group
(the name, really) is symbiotic with its various members.  People do
stuff, put cDc's name on it, get more notice than they were likely to
have gotten if they'd self-released it.  In turn, the brand is
strengthened.  It's a cool concept when there's stuff going on,
otherwise it canbe frustrating.  Definitely the think tank idea is
something we're trying to promote, as well.

> those projects. At least that's what I think right now, heh. The Flack man's
> opinion is always subject to change, haha.

Hah, yeah, that's the way it should be.  Things are pretty good,
cDc-wise, right now, but I'm not sure that I'll always think that's
true.  I get tired of being the only one posting on the main blog, for
instance, especially given that there are 20ish others with posting
access.  Well, Krass Katt posts sometimes, but she's the exception
lately...anyway, I ramble.  Things are pretty good, but shit happens
and people move in and out of the "cDc circle" or whatever and things
can change.  Hopefully things will stay good, but there are never any
guarantees.  We need to milk (hah) this recent media attention, which
we've done a reasonable job of so far, but it needs to continue.  G.
Ratte' told me that the word on the street at HOPE was that a lot of
the younger kids don't know who we are anymore; that was kind of
shocking, but I believe it.  Ever onward, though, gotta keep it
poppin' fresh.	Heh.

Yeah, that'd be rad.  That's the whole symbiotic brand-thing.  We (the
group, collectively) hype your project and in turn hype ourselves.  I
really am pushing for this to get released; sorry it's been a bit of a
delay on my part.  The whole Defcon thing happened, then there was the
stuff about Tibet and whatnot, and then I've been actually busy at
work for the past week (work is where I usually do cDc stuff), but I'm
pushing to get it out ASAP.

Yeah, 200 seems low.  Still, 200 copies is decent.  I'm thinking that,
if I sell enough copies of the cDc book to pay for it, I'll buy some
to consign in local bookstores.  Also, maybe do the
amazon-listing-thing (apparently, you have to manage your own
inventory to do that, at least, if I'm understanding it correctly).
I'd also like to get copies into the local libraries, not sure how to
go about doing that.  It'd be kind of fun(ny), though.	Thanks for the
insight into lulu; I'm pretty happy with the one copy I got (though
there were errors in it -- my fault, not theirs -- that have since
been corrected...I guess that's the point of a "preview copy"...and
hey, now my copy is a collectors' item, since it's got errors.	Hah).

Did DaYuM help you with the PR stuff?  I saw that you'd asked her to
on the forum, but I can't recall if she replied.  Good idea on selling
the stuff royalty-free to friends and such (eliminating the royalty
before the public release); I've sold 15 copies to cDc people, not
bad.  I'd have expected a few more, but money's tight for a lot of
people, definitely understandable.

I like your google app concept; Mixter seemed to dig it, too, though
you're right that it's geared toward a single platform.  Still, it's
good work that could/should be used somehow, I think.

Take care, man.  How'd the book release at OVGE go?

Sorry again for the lateness of the reply.

Flack, why do you insist on aligning yourself with these faggots, playing the
hacker game, and also storing your home videos on your host? We could have
quite easily released them. We know you ain't no hacker. Do us and yourself a
favour and get out of this circlejerk.

Oxblood Ruffin. Legendary hacker, leader to thousands, the mind behind the hardcore political
movement HACKTIVISMO, the man so many young kids aspire to be. Or not. Laird Brown, as he is 
better known to his friends (reporters), is a shmuck. He is nothing but a gobshite. Running his 
mouth around the internet bigging up cDc, his lame hacktivismo and let's not forget his blogs. 
You see, CDC have this thing, they tell hackers that they are not hackers, but then they tell 
the media that they are. To some extent I believe Ratte about this, but then why have this 
faggot Oxblood run around talking about sec related stuff that he knows nothing about.

^ wtf, i think my description is better. I mean he makes it sound like he is the internet's Martin
Luther King Jr.


Anyway, yeah..we owned him, here's his shit.

Dear Everyone, I'm an idiot.

I thought that I was replying directly to Kevin on my last post and it
turns out that this wasn't the case.

Here's the deal. Hacktivismo has worked on a Web auditing tool based
on "Google hacking" for the past year. Mixter came up with the idea,
and eventually I found a great German programmer named Thomas Gehrsitz
[handle = init0] to pull the whole thing together. He did a great job.
This app works great and is gonna be released in mid-January.

I asked Kevin some time ago if we could bring Thomas into the cDc.
IMO, he's a great addition; he gets the cDc; and he'd make us all
proud. Kevin thought about it and agreed. But there are also some
special considerations.

There are some new laws on the books in Germany WRT to "computer
security". These are basically very wide-ranging laws that make it
illegal to do security research unless you work for the government or
a "recognized" security firm. There are also other implications.

So I want to bring in Thomas but I also want to cover his ass, and
Mixy's too.

Maybe the German government won't care about the scanner. Cool. Then
later we say that it was Mixy's idea and Thomas programmed it. But for
right now we feel that it's best just to let KrassKat take the
programming credit.

Anyway, that's the dealey. Thomas is a great guy with loads of
connections in Germany/Europe. We're lucky to get him, IMO.

I wasn't trying to be deceptive with anyone in the herd, just trying
to keep this "hush-hush" to protect our German friends in case things
might get out of hand in the fatherland.

I have been quite graciously drafted into the CULT OF THE DEAD COW's 
Ninja Strike Force. Curious what that means? It means I'm now a part of 
the most elite public collective. Their name appears in hundreds of 
books, including text books. There isn't all that much more to say about 
it than that. Expect me to start churning out the most badass tools and 
information in the name of the cDc NSF.

This guys has more contacts than a spammer. His whole life, online and off,

///////////////////////////////
When L0phtCrack was purchased by @stake (by way of Directed Doodling,
and 'SST'), there was some language that you had placed in the
contract that, if i am correct, would result in a reversion of
ownership to the original authors in the event that the program is not
made commercially available for more than a year.

If you could take a quick look for a copy of that contract in your
files, that would be great. We are considering commercializing the
product again in a slightly different form if we can get Symantec (the
last owners) to cough it up. We feel they are still bound by these
agreements, and we'd like to find fresh copies of them, and get an
opinion on how to proceed.

Ya, know for a bunch of people who were very close friends we sure have
messed things up. The only person I ever had any ill will against was Mudge
and while that is not a hundred percent resolved and probably never will be
I've tried to put it behind me. As for the wedding I don't think I ever
officially knew you two were married I just assumed it I think. I suspect at
the time of your wedding I probably wasn't a very socialable person anyway
and most likely would not have attended even if invited. Invitations or lack
thereof to things like weddings and such don't bother me. Those are rather
personal events and it doesn't bother me in the least if I am or I am not
invited.

Don't worry, Cris, I like ya just fine.

Things definitely got pretty distant after people started trickling
away from @stake. I can't say that I've done a very good job of
maintaining any kind of social behavior whatsoever. That said, I've
always been more concerned that if I make a whole bunch of friends
that I wouldn't be able to maintain the relationships responsibly,
when I made all that company stuff my top priority. It's coming up on
ten years that I will have been fighting to finish the software I
started on in 2000. I suppose this is what I was meant to do :P And
frankly, if it doesn't work out for me, I'm going to be hella pissed
and I'm going to be even more intolerable for a while (if that's
possible).

Anyway, I dont want anyone to think my distance has been because I
dont like them. I dont know how anyone got that idea from me, other
than the fact that I've been a pretty grumpy dude lately in general. I
suppose you might know what that's like ;)

'll put up whatever you guys want, just send me the links. I'd rather post
links than host content though but as long as it is text that should be OK.
At the same time I'd rather not have hundreds of links to crap, just the
juicy stuff. I added the Cyber UL since it seems to be getting some press
lately and the Buffer Overflow thing since it is listed in Mudge's wikipedia
page.

Speaking of which we can add all the advisories to the Wikipedia page, I
have no qualms about editing it myself as long as someone sends me the
links. Or is one of the VDB's out there have a cool search engine where we
can link to all the old advisories at once that would be cool to.

I'll add the dates to the pages as soon as I have ten minutes. Same for your
email forward Tan. Probably Wednesday.

		    CHECK OUT HOW LAME THESE KIDS ARE:
 
 
From Fluffy - Novice222:
 
Well i still cant compile it with any visual studio but i will try on with 6.0 and the errors there
are a few linking errors:
LIBCMTD.lib(dbgheap.obj) : error LNK2005: _malloc already defined in fake_libc.obj
LIBCMTD.lib(dbgheap.obj) : error LNK2005: _free already defined in fake_libc.obj
LIBCMTD.lib(dbgheap.obj) : warning LNK4006: _malloc already defined in fake_libc.obj; second
definition ignored
LIBCMTD.lib(dbgheap.obj) : warning LNK4006: _free already defined in fake_libc.obj; second
definition ignored
Creating library Debug/srv_fun.lib and object Debug/srv_fun.exp
LIBCMTD.lib(crt0.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _main
Debug/srv_fun.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals
i dont know what to do. Confused
Also one thing that has been on my mind, authentification.... when making a server with it in the
gui it says "Single User" does that mean it was made in the 
 
thought of making one later that could support multi users?
 
 
 
Check Your email Fluffy - Novice222 :
Wow thanks, i guess that was directed to my messiness Laughing (it was realy nice that you took the
time and i had a look and i think its ok if you post it 
 
though i cant compile it myself Crying or Very sad ) however i cant compile it Confused BTW what
version are you using to compile your projects, ive tried 
 
2005 and 6.0 and neither works with it..... i just dont understand whats visual studios problem
Question anyways i dont realy know how to setup 6.0 ive just 
 
new since installed it, so i think i might eventually make it work. Rolling Eyes 
 
 
New Admin Fluffy - Novice222:
Wow.... sounds sweet.... though im not good enough to do the programming work..... but if i will
try my best Very Happy 
 
New Admin Fluffy - Novice222:
Ok, i will find info on those and download something Razz . Also I dont know anything about unix
but im a really good PHP programmer.
 
New Admin Fluffy - Novice222:
Oh thanks.... but are you still going to be here as much or are gonna take some time off? Razz I
have Smart FTP 2 which should be able to do all ftp tasks. I 
 
know i dont know a lot about these developer programs but i will learn it pretty quickly.
 
 
 
 
 
New Admin - Digger - Fluffy:
Ok, I updated your Title and permissions to Project Administrator.I will try to recruit a person or
two that are good with C+ cause I my self don't know it 
 
yet. I want to help keep us moving foward and help update and expand Bo2k's plugin selection.
 
New Admin - Fluffy - Digger:
Wow.... i did except that sooner or later but not so out of sudden.... i guess we will have to
learn C++ then.
 
 
 
 
New Admin Fluffy - Digger:
C++, a good tutorial and some aspirins.
 
New Admin Fluffy - Novice:
I need some help getting started with making C++ work (Visual C++ 6.0) ive tried to compile botool
just as a test and got some errors and i dont know what to 
 
do. Well really just two different errors but i dont know how to fix them.
cli_botool\clzhcompress.cpp(465) : error C2065: 'FileName' : undeclared identifier 
 
I get a lot of these undeclared identifier errors in clzhcompress.h and only there.... ?? And i
also get errors about cli_botool\src\explorefunc.cpp(31) : 
 
fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'botool.h': No such file or directory botool.h and
resource.h not being there though they are in the project as 
 
they are supposed to be..... ?? I would be really grateful if you could help me with that.
 
Shell Fluffy - Novice:
How can i access the saved files of bo2k? (dont know that stuff Razz ) With shell server right? But
i can only connect to my folder which is empty....
 
Devteam Fluffy - Novice:
I am updating the site since its kinda outdated. (just links and stuff) in
http://bo2k.com/dev/devteam.html what should be displayed as your name?
 
Coranto Fluffy - Novice:
How do i use coranto? Or do i have to do the news manually?
 
CVS Fluffy - Novice:
I have a problem with CVS.... and i dont know what to do..... no matter what i try i cant
connect..... i get:
....\Temp\TortoiseCVS make new module temp\: cvs.exe -q import
-m bo2k_plugins tcvs-vendor tcvs-release
CVSROOT=:ext:fluffy-stuff@bo2k.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bo2k
 
cvs [import aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)
 
Error, CVS operation failed
 
do you know anything about that?
 
New Source Fluffy - Novice:
Ok.... for the first time everything is working however i downloaded all the bo2k files via CVS but
the stuff is old.... where are the new sources?? (sorry 
 
for spamming like that but im just not very used to this yet)
 
New Source Fluffy - Novice:
What about bopeep? The only source download for it i found was version 0.9 and in the SSH i found
version 1.1 (i found that out after compiling it). I would 
 
really like the new source and see if i can fix the copy button..... because till now visual studio
hasnt worked but now it does so i can compile the plugins 
 
which means that i can make it. Only one question for that..... which way did you intend to make
the copy button work? (i heard you can convert the screen to 
 
an HBITMAP and then copy it to clipboard).
PS: phpBB works again all out of sudden.....
 
Coranto Fluffy - Novice:
I have a problem with the coranto folder.... when i try to change the ch back to 770 SSH tells me
"Error writing file atributes".....
 
Coronto Fluffy - Digger:
(sorry if it took some time to respond.... my phpBB account was screwed....) Ok account name
DiGgErX and pass "diggerx" non capital (you should change that) 
 
Well after posting a news in coranto you will have to use SSH Secure Shell to move the new news
files into the coranto folder.... you will only need a single 
 
command. http://charlotte.at.northwestern.edu/bef/sshdist.html#windows download it and connect to
sourceforge (shell.sourceforge.net port 22). In file 
 
transfer client you can see all the bo2k website data (/home/groups/b/bo/bo2k/htdocs/) but you wont
need that to move the news files into the coranto 
 
folder.... instead open the Shell Client and put in the command: cp
/tmp/persistent/bo2kdata/NewsFiles/* /home/groups/b/bo/bo2k/htdocs/coranto so you wont 
 
always have to browse down to those folders. You will also need a CVS tool for the bo2k sources
http://www.tortoisecvs.org/ and an ftp client 
 
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/FTP-Clients/SmartFTP.shtml . The ones above are just those
which i recommend... you can use any tool you want.
 
 
 
Info Passwd Novice - Digger:
Digger you can forward this to Fluffy.....
Sorry for the delay guys but I was away and didn't have
access to the necessary material.
Here are all the passwords to the mailing lists.....they
aren't used much anymore...they have been deemed almost
obsolete by the phpBB
 
 
 
New Programmer Digger - Fluffy:
Tell me what you think. This was the email.
 
Hi
 
I am interested in providing help for your project. I have
worked in C/C++ last 5 yrs. And I remember using BO2K long
time back and found it interesting. Let me know if I can be
of any help to you....
 
thanks
Srinivas
 
New Programmer Fluffy - DiggerX:
Sounds great.... i already would have a little job for him.... but first novice has to tell me
where the new bopeep sources are
 
New Programmer Digger - Fluffy:
Ok, looks good so far. This person can start with in a week. What do you think we should have him
look at/work on first, to see what he can do? Should we 
 
have hime make a new plugin or just add to or fix a small bug in one? If so, which bugged plugin?
Or, should we really put him to the test and see if he can 
 
brind the RootKit up to date with Vista? Let me know what you think.
 
 
ps. Been reading C and C++ for Dummies. So far only able to add some line of code to those small
test programs. Still have a very long way to go in 
 
understanding the complete lang.
 
Thanks
DiGgErX
 
 
 
Making Server undetectable Digger - Fluffy :
 
I don't wan't to post this info cause AV people could be around, you never know. I simply Hex edit
my servers. I found encrypter just screw things up. Hexing 
 
I can still edit my servers with config tool and server work 100%. Still tring to understand C++
have some tuts but learning this on my own is hard. Talk 
 
later...
 
 
 
Digger being hardass to no0b:
(You must be a active and provide on going participation in our forum)Sorry but, I see you only

God damn that all felt so good. We pwned cultdeadcow.com, ninjastrikeforce.com/
robohara.com, oxblood.net, hacktivismo.com, bo2k.com, comradesmack.com, dildog's
life... That's a lot of stuff! Stopping was optional, there's no end! 

cdc has some interesting people and some who are technically inclined. But that's
the thing, interesting *people*, not interesting *hackers*. That is only a 
problem because they tell the world that they are leading hackers, when they do
not even qualify. At best they had a couple of people in the mid-90s, and now a
couple of people who joined cdc but whose tech interests are entirely unrelated.
Any hacking going on is not going on in cdc; cdc is just a banner organisation
that they can all use to add another line to their About pages.

They need to fuck off with this hacker stuff. Just drop it. Drop oxblood because
he is only around to be the media man. Just settle for being a community of
friends, and resist the temptation to tell people that cdc is a hacking group.
It's just a big scam, a big lie - gobbles said it in 2002 and we are saying it
now. You have defined your organisation around the concept of misleading people
who are not in a position to know better.

The Pwnee Awards are a whenever-we-want underground ceremony celebrating feats in 
being pwned. We (ZF0) are the pwners, the winners are pwnees. This is our little
review of the zine, a winding down as we end.

$page = 'index.txt';
require_once "$page";

?>

The above code is a textbook file include vulnerability. One little catch 
though, remote files were disabled, so we had to use fun tricks to own the 
box. Those tricks are Copyright ZF0 2008, we'll license them for the right
price! Seriously though, that's a really bad vuln. It's obvious, easy to 
find (completely outer layer), and easy to exploit.


=============================================================================
== Most Thoroughly Refuted Whitehat Security Product ========================
=============================================== Winner: Comodo HackerProof ==
=============================================================================

Not much to say on this except that HackerProof does not do much for you, 
and that the naming is complete misrepresentation meant to separate fools 
and their money.

Not much point, unfortunately, since anyone reading this already knew that.


=============================================================================
== Most Hashes Cracked ======================================================
=======================================================  Winner: Blackcode ==
=============================================================================

We actually cracked something over 4,000 of the nearly 10,000 blackcode 
hashes. We have invented a Noob Index. It works like this: you take the 
percent of hashes cracked, and double it. That's how juvenile the 
community is. Gives BC over a 80 score, the highest in this zine.

There have been a lot of complaints about us dropping hashes, and about 
the length of our zine. So we just saved all those for ourselves and gave
you the mod passwords, motherfuckers. You can beg us for passes if you need 
them!


=============================================================================
== So Annoying We Couldn't Stop Ourselves From Publishing Their Lame Asses ==
=================================================== Winner: Triviasecurity ==
=============================================================================

That basically says it all right there. They are the least notable hack in 
this zine but someone just got too annoyed at them.


=============================================================================
== Most Outrageous RM =======================================================
============================================================ Winner: g00ns ==
=============================================================================

Everything from DDoSing their server, to mass confusion about who did the rm,
to g00ns members trolling, quitting, lecturing, complaining, and probably
crying, it was just a good time watching.


====================== Until next time, stay safe! ==========================

(THIS IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL - OWNER OF SHELL BOX ONLY)

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON

Good Day!

I am a internet hacker from the group ZF0. I am writing you this email to ask
for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction. We have
discovered some abandoned warez that includes, g00ns IRC logs dating back 
months, full g00ns hack logs and misc Wordpress databases, on a random computer 
somewhere in Italy. We believe the box belonged to a deceased internet hacker. 
We have made every attempt to contact next-of-kin but none have been 
forthcoming.

We have now decided to look for a trusted partner to apply a claim to this
data. The problem is we need a foreign computer to house this data as we cannot
afford to maintain the deceased internet connection - it must be foreign as we 
do not wish the data to fall into the hands of computer forensics agents. We 
see that as e-walking on someones grave.

If you are willing to help us, please confirm via contacting us on the email
address below. Please send your Full name, IP address, domains you own and most
importantly valid ssh account details to allow us to transport the data via the
secure protocol (We do not want government agencies to wiretap and steal the
data in transit).

You are most kind good sir

Sincerly,
Giovanni Balechi
