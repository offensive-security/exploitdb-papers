We, the masked crusaders of ZF0, have again returned from the depths of
the hackcave to bring justice to some and hope to many. We do the work
that civil society is not prepared to do, and in doing so we transcend law
and social norms. We're here to keep the internet safe from cretins,
knaves, noobs and whitehats. 

Much has changed behind the production that is ZF0. Some of this has been
within our control and some has not. However, we feel that this edition
features a noticable increase in the quality of our material. We have
invested more time into our articles, as opposed to our previous pattern
of essentially dumping past hacks. Additionally we have compromised in
part with criticisms about what data we publish and how, while still
maintaining the originality and integrity of our zine.

We have arranged the articles in a way that the second half of them
generally complement the first. In this way your reading pleasure can be 
easily split into two events. As well, ZF03 is self-extracting. 

Some of the highlights include our owning of Whitedust et al. in response
to our own Call For 0wning, and our thorough owning of HellBound Hackers.
With HBH we owned any wankers worth laughing at and then we owned some
more. It is a massive article; for that reason alone we placed by the end.

This issue is dedicated to fallen comrades.

I first looked up this site in the hunt for the ever media whoring 'psg'.
What I found pissed me off enough to take the decision to own it.
'Bringing new life to the UK scene'? The UK scene doesn't need fags like
you. You claim to be hackers, you even think you're the leetest things
since bread came sliced. Well here's a news flash, your site sucks, your
content sucks and receiving RSS feeds of milw0rm doesn't make you a
hacker. Your severe lack of respect, intelligence and arrogance has
brought you here, and will more than likely bring you here again. I have
no doubt you won't learn your lesson, after all, we're just the kiddies
who can't code and ./wget milw0rm aren't we? fags. As a side note: any
site allowing psg to spout his media whoring bullshit must be owned,
cDcnsf - Bite me.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN ANY FORM OF EXPLOIT CODE ON THESE FORUMS. These

## Not so funny? here you go.

Skoby -> Sarah

Sarah,

Last night when we spoke on the phone, you asked me to open up and talk to
you. I couldn't, at least not then. Knowing you now for almost two years
has been a fountain of mixed feelings, some brilliant, and some difficult.
From when i first met you in college i was crazy about you, when we first
met you told me you were single, so naturally, and arrogently, I thought
that I had a chance. Then after about i think it was 3/4 weeks, you told
me that you were going out with Fraser. I was so devistated, it was like
my heart had been ripped out of my chest and stabbed onto the desk. Once
you told me how old he was I was so fulled with rage and hatred.

The first time we went thru to see him, i had planned to kick the shit out
of him and leave him for dead. Only thing that stopped me was knowing that
it would probably severly jepordise our friendship, even end it. So that
day I bit my tounge and got thru it. Afterwords i just wanted to ask you
what the hell you were thinking, i was so discusted that you were with
THAT!

Anyways, each day went by in college, and as each day went by I started to
hurt more and more, when finally I couldn't take any more, I had only one
choice, leave college. I couldn't put up with seeing you every day, each
day I went home and i just collapsed into a sea of depression and hatred
towards him. So I broke off contact, which by the way is the most hardest
thing to do, especially when you love someone so intensly. But, i couldn't
resist contacting you again and again, because i was scared that you might
become more infatuated with Fraser, and Sarah, that's what it was,
infatuation and obsession. It was pretty obvious what he was, a discusting
pervert, and indeed we now know he is a paedophile as well. But if i said
that to you, could you have imagined what your responce would have been?!
I couldn't say that to you, I was risking any chance that we might have
together.

As we spent more time together, I started to love you more and more. Sarah
I would have done anything for you, gave you anytime you wanted. I was so
wanted to make you happy and I wanted to experiance all the wonderous and
joyous things in the world with you. Last year at the airport, wathcing
the planes come in, I really thought that day that it would be it, but you
quickly put a stop to it, and i let you aswell. I just sat there and said,
"Ok, sure no problem". What in the hell was i thinking, i should have
pushed and pushed, yet i never, feel such an idiot. Sure nothing might not
have happened, but I am so angry at myself for not even trying!

After that day, things just got worse and worse...

Anyway, cutting past more shitty feelings, and more meetings, we made
contact again last month. You told me that you had broke up with Fraser,
and you told me what you had found out about him. After you told me on the
phone i was physically sick because i never said anything in college. I
felt so incredibly bad that i was so selfish and that i only looked out
for myself and never said anything, that you ended up getting hurt so
badly, by such a monster.

Now, here is what i am so incredibly pissed off at. To start, you haved
claimed on several occasions that you have had no feelings for me, yet on
even more occasions, you have contradicted yourself. To start with,
Glasgow airport, sure it was almost an hour of pure passion and i was the
happiest guy in the world then. Why in the hell would you have been so
passionate with me if you didn't have any feelings at all?? Thats one of
the things that I do not get! Also, remember our rather lengthy
conversations last September on MSN, about the cockpit fantasies and the
such? Back then you admitted that you had feelings for me and that you
found me attractive and that you often thought about me. Its a shame i
still dont have the chat logs, could have refreshed your memory. And
another occasion, one more recent, where you admitted to me when we were
sitting by the clyde that if i made a move in college that you would have
acted on it because you said and I quote, "I really fancied you back then,
and I still do". Now i know that fancing someone and having feelings about
them are two different things Sarah, but maybe you could explain last
Tuesday for me?? We were in your living room, and we were telling each
other how we felt, eventually i couldn't take any more and i kissed you.
The look on your face was so incredible. You even said that you were happy
that I did that, whys that I wonder? And why did you keep kissing me back,
and why did you even want me to get more closer, and you know what i'm
talking about. But then the next morning i recieved an email entitled, "Uh
oh" saying that, "I have been thinking about last night, and i think it
would be best if we stayed friends until a good few months". I was so
incredibly ill and sick that day, was so unfair.

Ok, why would you want to mess with my head like that? Its pretty obvious
that you have feelings for me yet your too afraid to admit them! Sarah, i
wish you wouldn't keep messing me around, one day i'm on top of the world
because the girl that i have been so madly in love with for nearly 2 years
has finally opened up and she feels the same way, and the next day im so
incredibly heartbroken and devistated because your just throwing
everything back into my face. You have NO IDEA how hard it has been! I
have held out hope for you for so long because i loved you so much, but
now i fail to see what the point is. Sure Sarah, we can still be the best
of friends, and I could keep putting on a show, making everything seem as
if it is alright, but I cant. Its just got to the stage now where
everything that we've went thru is just destroying me, its killing me. And
another thing that hurt and angered me, last night so said on the phone
that i wasn't your type?! So what is?! 30 year old 18 stone perverted
paedophiles?!

One of the things your longing for is for someone to really love you after
you've went thru, your mum tells me how you feel. Well Sarah there is
someone out there who can truly love you, and appreciate you for how
special you really are. Sure theres probably more than one, but i doubt
you'll ever find anyone who could love you in the way that I do.

I'd just like to say these last final words. Always act on your heart, not
your head, and stop trying to analyse life and just live it.

I know i shouldn't be, but i'm still hoping that you change your mind, its
something that I cannot help, i'm only human. If you do, let me know
sooner than later. If you have any feelings, no matter how small then act
on them. If you dont, then dont email me back, i'll already know. :( And
in that case, i'll hopefully see you when i'll return from America.

Gordon

I just want to thank you for keeping your phone on and meeting me today. 
I knew i could rely on you.

Well Gordon, im not taking anymore of my so called friends letting me
down, and yes I AM angry.  If its not Pamela its you.

Tomorrow is your last chance to meet me or we can just forget about
everything, i am sick and tired of being let down without notice and being
the "bad one"

I have called and called your house and there has been no response.

Call me tonight if you want to arrange to meet, if i dont hear anything
then i know where i stand.

Sarah

Skoby -> Sarah
WTF DO YOU THINK YOUR UP TO?!

First off I am not wasting my life away, IF I WAS WOULD I HAVE APPLIED TO
OVER 20 UNIVERSITES ALL OVER THE UK AND AMERICA TO STUDY FOR A PHD IN
COMPUTER SCIENCE?!

Sarah -> Skoby

No excuse me who was the one who never phoned me? i told you to leave your
phone on to contact me, i've also asked you repeatedly to phone me but i
dont know whats wrong with me.

Why didn't you tell me you weren't going to meet me?  i went home early
thinking you were going to meet me.

Skoby -> Sarah 
Sarah I'm going to the bridges, if you love them so much then you know
where they are, but i'm not going. And what is it with you wanting to
get a double hotel room, thats just a bit weird dont ya think?

Do me a big favour, dont contact me again and dont call the house when
I get back, if you do i'll just block incoming calls from your
numbers.

Sarah -> Skoby
Sorry?	Im sorry Gordon, but the only reason i asked was because you said
yes.  If you didnt want to then you shoud have said so.

Why are you mad at me?

Sarah

Sarah->Skoby
Im just a bit shocked at why you've sent me this hurtful email when on msn
you were happy to talk to me.  Whats going on?

Can you explain why?

Skoby -> Sarah
I dont have to because i dont need to, nor do I want to. Just leave me
alone Sarah, ok?

Sarah -> Skoby
You wont need to block me because i wont be in contact anymore.
Sarah

Poor Skoby, not only are you an emo fag, now everyone knows that you're an
Emo fag. Get out of the scene and stay out the scene.

We need to keep sites like this off the net. And to all the members of
this site, if you feature in this zine, you know whose fault it is? Ours?
no. Belial and all the other admins i featured above have been letting you
log into a backdoored forum for a long time. I didn't even backdoor it and
managed to find it. So Skoby/Belial/TeaC i hope you're happy with your new
found fame, something which you've been after for along now, now get the
fuck out of the scene, especially you skoby.

Sites like this really do piss me off, but not as much as when I irc'd
with these people, their lack of knowledge astounds me, especially when
they think they are the bee's knees. News Flash: You fake scene whoring
pieces of shit can bite me, you're lucky I didn't release all the irc logs
of you fags.

Btw, your irc servers are owned and sniffed and also, Vesalius, your
homebox is backdoored, and I have your address.

<@Be|ia|> i mean pr0j3t g4yh4m ##oh dear, WHITEHAT.

Ok, with the main ownage over, lets check out some more IRC logs of these

01:22:47 < naxxtor> Do not ask us to hack anything for you. We will not
tell you how to compromise your ex-girlfriend's e-mail account and we will
not do it for you. Nor will we help you deface you school's website or get
root on your school's network. If you want to do any of these type of
things then it is your own business and we don't want want to know about
it.

13:31 <&_hyper_> ty
13:32 <&Vesalius> SHAGGSTaRR, I don't
13:32 <&Vesalius> im hardly ever at another computer
13:32 <&Vesalius> infact
13:32 <&Vesalius> I never am
13:32 <&SHAGGSTaRR> You're missing out on one of the key brilliances of
the intertubes then.
13:32 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Being able to take your shit with you no matter where
you might happen to land yourself.
13:33 <&Vesalius> thats what the laptop is for
13:33 <+DesertRose> Shagg, was it you who was in like.... Portugal, I
think
13:33 <+DesertRose> and said you went to the internet cafe across the
street from the hotwl
13:33 <&SHAGGSTaRR> What if you pwnd a machine (that wasn't an led
display) at brumhv and wanted to post from it?
13:33 <+DesertRose> *hotel
13:33 <&SHAGGSTaRR> yeah, it was spain.
13:33 <+DesertRose> ah Spain
13:34 <&Vesalius> SHAGGSTaRR, machine or led display..
13:34 <&Vesalius> whats the obvious choice?
13:34 <+DesertRose> right, was just wondering if that was you or someone
else, heh
13:34 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Touche =/
13:34 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Timboss went to portugal
13:34 <+DesertRose> yeah
13:34 <+DesertRose> I remember now
13:34 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Ves what if you weren't in Craplins then?
13:34 <&Vesalius> id go to there
13:34 <&SHAGGSTaRR> lol
13:35 <&SHAGGSTaRR> What if you wanted to prove some amazingly leet shit
and post FROM THE LED DISPLAY?
13:35 <&Vesalius> then if I could do that I could get my password somehow
13:35 <&SHAGGSTaRR> How?
13:35 <&Vesalius> how would I post from the led display?
13:36 <+x4e> or use someone elses credentials @ vesalius
13:36 <&SHAGGSTaRR> ssh into your box and run through your firefox cookies
with a text editor?
13:36 <&Vesalius> SHAGGSTaRR, not a bad idea..lol
13:36 <&Vesalius> except
13:36 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Or you could just remember your passwords...
13:36 <&Vesalius> ipb doesnt store pwds in cookies #l0l
13:36 <&SHAGGSTaRR> If you don't someone else will ;P
13:36 <&SHAGGSTaRR> How does it then?
13:36 <&Vesalius> that password was a random password
13:36 <&Vesalius> from my tfom.net login info # wait, I thought you didn't
re-use nigger?
13:37 <&SHAGGSTaRR> openid?
13:37 <&Vesalius> ?
13:37 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Where you store your shit on either your server or a
dedicated openif box
13:37 <&Vesalius> this machine
13:37 <&SHAGGSTaRR> and the server you wanna log into runs a check with
your openid host and checks you are who you say you are
13:38 <&SHAGGSTaRR> meant to make the whole process more streamlined but
I've not looked into it too much
13:38 <&SHAGGSTaRR> I might host openflid for myself and jojo if it
actually kicks off
13:39 <&Vesalius> great
13:39 <&Vesalius> I have blue tak stuck in my ear
13:40 <&SHAGGSTaRR> http://openid.net/
13:40 <&Vesalius> thats better
13:40 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Better than having muftak on yout IRC
13:40 <&SHAGGSTaRR> >_>
13:40 <&SHAGGSTaRR> <_<
13:43 <+x4e> Anyone know where I can buy individual SecureId's?   seems
every site sells them in packs of 5 :S 
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Your best bet would be a shoop
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> A shop even
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> no
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> a shoop
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Shoop da whoop for a pack de uno
13:44 <+x4e> which shoop? :)
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> No idea, you'd deffo know better than me
13:44 <&SHAGGSTaRR> But for the fact that even if they sell in packs of 5
or so only
13:45 <&SHAGGSTaRR> you can say to the store guy "Hey, can I just 'ave one
please mate?"
13:45 <+x4e> hmm could try :D 
13:45 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Like how I bought 3 single dvds instead of the whole
pack of ten yesterday
13:45 <+x4e> Anyone got any spare (steal from work?) SecureId's ?
13:46 <&SHAGGSTaRR> I have an NHS ID holder to go round your neck 
13:46 <&SHAGGSTaRR> And probably the id
13:46 <+x4e> see thats not really the same thing shaggstar
13:46 <&SHAGGSTaRR> I also know I could use my library cards outer
lamination over a self made ID in there
13:46 <+x4e> unless i want to be a pretend gynocologist 
13:46 <&SHAGGSTaRR> hmm so what exactly are these things you're after?
13:46 <&SHAGGSTaRR> I don't need to pretend.
13:46 <&SHAGGSTaRR> I hang with you minges all day.
13:47 <&SHAGGSTaRR> hmm so what exactly are these things you're after?

16:11 <&Vesalius> okay
16:11 <&Vesalius> belial, what was wrong earlier?
16:12 < belial> i was doing like 5 things at the same time as well as
sorting out the vurnablities on the forums
16:12 < belial> so i just got pissed off with that guy or whever he was
16:13 < belial> had to take some offline time to concentrate on what i was
doing
16:13 <&Vesalius> oh sorry
16:13 <&Vesalius> that guy was me
16:13 <&Vesalius> not all the time
16:13 <&Vesalius> but when you were here
16:13 <&Vesalius> and he joined, I connected as him
16:13 <&_hyper_> bololcks
16:14 <&Vesalius> so he couldn't use that nick
16:14 <&_hyper_> just finished writing a massive post
16:14 <&_hyper_> >:(

16:15 < belial> so its all going to be down till i can upgrade
16:15 < belial> shouldnt take too long id imagine

16:16 <~belial> what the hell happend anyway?
16:16 <&_hyper_> pm belial
16:16 <&Vesalius> he appears to heavily dislike psg for some reason
##yessssir
16:16 <&Vesalius> and when he noticed him
16:16 <&Vesalius> he started complaining about hackers miss representing
other
16:16 <&Vesalius> s
16:16 <&Vesalius> and elitist stuck up self conscious fuckers
16:16 <&Vesalius> lol
16:16 <&Vesalius> lol
16:17 <&SHAGGSTaRR> One of which he happened to be
16:17 <&Vesalius> yup
16:17 <&_hyper_> what was his handle again?
16:17 <&Vesalius> htek
16:17 <&SHAGGSTaRR> htek
16:17 <&Vesalius> and as per usual
16:17 <&_hyper_> that was it
16:17 <&Vesalius> he started an argument here
16:17 <&Vesalius> and
16:17 <&Vesalius> got virtually no where #LOL
16:17 <&Vesalius> as me and SHAGGSTaRR were active
16:17 <&Vesalius> so he got some rather amusing things back =]
16:17 <&SHAGGSTaRR> ROFL at itv1
16:17 <~Be|ia|> btw he was useing a shell
16:17 <&_hyper_> dont suppose you whoised him did you?
16:18 <&Vesalius> and then he posted my password in here
16:18 <&SHAGGSTaRR> this show is fucking badasssss
16:18 <&Vesalius> _hyper_, yup
16:18 <~Be|ia|> that the forum is vunrable too 
16:18 <@shaman> what's up with the forums?
16:18 <&Vesalius> I've restarted since =[
16:18 <~Be|ia|> but it wasnt even his exploit ##NIGGA WUUUT?
16:18 <&Vesalius> but I have logs somewhere
16:18 <~Be|ia|> he just found that
16:18 <&SHAGGSTaRR> so wait
16:18 <&SHAGGSTaRR> it wasnt a forum exploit
16:18 <&SHAGGSTaRR> but a shell he gained?
16:18 <&SHAGGSTaRR> ssh vuln? #YES 0DAY LOL
16:19 <~belial> no no
16:19 <~belial> ill explain
16:19 <~belial> ive been fucking around with this C$hell thing
16:19 <~belial> c99 shell ##dud3, i wudn't lower myself
16:19 <@shaman> did I miss something?
16:19 <~belial> its a PHP page
16:19 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Web based shell?
16:19 <~belial> that you upload and take control over the webserver
16:19 <~belial> yeh
16:19 <&SHAGGSTaRR> ooh not good
16:20 <~belial> so he must have found it
16:20 <&SHAGGSTaRR> That shit's typically something you never use on a box
YOU pay for
16:20 <&SHAGGSTaRR> For a reason.
16:20 <&SHAGGSTaRR> :P
16:20 <@shaman> *cough*
16:20 <@shaman> what's going on? :P
16:20 <~belial> yeah i had this happen to the galleries so natrually i
removed it
16:20 <~belial> but then i stuck it on a random folder
16:20 <~belial> but guessing it got indexed
16:21 <&_hyper_> Shaman: our forums are full of holes
16:21 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Stick it somewhere not so obvious and see what
security precautions you can mod onto it
16:21 <&_hyper_> so where updating them
16:21 <&Vesalius> belial, its php?
16:22 <@shaman> not good :\
16:22 <~naxxtor> huh what eh
16:22 <&Vesalius> OH NOW he appears
16:22 <~belial> yeah itws php based
16:22 <~naxxtor> what's going on
16:22 <&Vesalius> maplins
16:22 <+x4e> the passwords in plaintext then or he crack vesa's nubby
pass?
16:22 <&Vesalius> they haxored us
16:22 <~belial> no 
16:22 <&Vesalius> something about LED displays being compromised
16:22 <~belial> its very hard for them to get the password #LYING TO YOUR
NOOB FRIENDS
16:22 <&_hyper_> lol
16:22 <&Vesalius> x4e, that wasn't really nubby
16:22 <~belial> the only way is by modifing the loging script
16:23 <~naxxtor> what happened?
16:23 <~belial> to echo the entered password to a file
16:23 <+x4e> werent it like 3 chars ves?
16:23 <+BOfH> They got p4wned
16:23 <&SHAGGSTaRR> So he must had had access to where they were stored on
your end
16:23 <&Vesalius> x4e, no it want
16:23 <~belial> the forums are down due to UPGRADES not pwnage
16:23 <+x4e> ahh kk i misread then :D 
16:23 <&SHAGGSTaRR> UPGRADES brought on by pwnage
16:23 <&_hyper_> lmao @ belial ## thats the spirit
16:23 <&Vesalius> belial, that means hes had access for a while then
16:23 <~naxxtor> eh
16:23 <&Vesalius> if he is echoing when we login
16:24 <+BOfH> belial: Turn the server off, seize the disks and rebuilt it
on new disks
16:24 <&Vesalius> the last time I logged in before he pasted it in here
16:24 <~naxxtor> why do all the exciting things happen when i'm indisposed
16:24 <&_hyper_> or he has downloaded the database
16:24 <&Vesalius> was very early yesterday
16:24 <&Vesalius> or possibly the day before
16:24 <&Vesalius> naxxtor, because you could of helped
16:24 <~naxxtor> someone comrpromised the login script didn't thety
16:24 <~belial> no he cant download the database
16:25 <~naxxtor> i knew it!!! i've suspected that for AGES
16:25 <&SHAGGSTaRR> I think he had access to where they were stored on the
server, not waiting for people to log in.
16:25 <~belial> IPB doesnt work like that
16:25 <+BOfH> belial: Is this the thing that's hosted on a VM?
16:25 <&SHAGGSTaRR> So how does IPB work then to check that a pass given
correlates with the pass stored?
16:26 <~naxxtor> it'll md5 hash the password that's been input
16:26 <~naxxtor> then compare it to an md5 in the DB
16:26 <&Vesalius> but if he compromised it
16:26 <&SHAGGSTaRR> So he's had awhile to crack 'em then =/
16:26 <&Vesalius> that means he has most peoples
16:26 <~belial> its a MD5 salt
16:26 <~naxxtor> however if you modified the login script he'd have access
to plaintext passwords
16:26 <~naxxtor> which is bad
16:26 <&Vesalius> exactly
16:26 <&SHAGGSTaRR> Well md5s aren't uncrackable
16:26 <&SHAGGSTaRR> http://www.milw0rm.com/cracker for example
16:26 <&Vesalius> hes had access to it for over 24 hours in that case
16:26 <~belial> md5s arnt, but they are salted
16:27 <~naxxtor> SHAGGSTaRR, md5s arn't uncrackable but it still takes a
long time
16:27 <~naxxtor> it's easier to snarf the passwords
16:27 <&SHAGGSTaRR> So either way he's had a good while to play with the
box =/
16:28 <~belial> anyway it will all be sorted out soon in a few seconds
16:28 <~belial> no last acess was today
16:28 <~belial> and no access was made to database
16:28 <~naxxtor> where were the passwords being stored
16:29 <~belial> on a fag packet
16:29 <~belial> btw forums are back up
16:31 <&Vesalius> belial, he had access for at least 24 hours though
16:31 <~naxxtor> did you pay for them this time?
16:32 <~belial> yes
16:33 <~naxxtor> cool
16:33 <~naxxtor> now what happened to our old theme
16:33 <&_hyper_> lol on a fag packet
16:34 <~belial> refresh your browser duuud

17:01 <~naxxtor> i gave him a shell ### OWNED

17:02 <~belial> ??who?
17:02 <&Vesalius> "When you get home you can tell everyone you've seen

17:02 <~naxxtor> and he symlinked .bash_history to /dev/null
17:02 <&Vesalius> "yeah and I can get sectioned"
17:02 <&Vesalius> naxxtor, thats quite clever =]
17:02 <&Vesalius> but wrong
17:02 <~belial> who did you give a shell to?
17:02 <~naxxtor> m4tr1x
17:02 <&Vesalius> >=[

17:02 <&Vesalius> m4tr1x === htek
17:02 <&Vesalius> btw
17:02 <~naxxtor> i gave him a shell on a VM
17:03 <~belial> why?
17:03 <~naxxtor> completely sectioned off from the rest of the world ##not
really fag, i irc'd from it..
17:03 <~naxxtor> so all he had access to was my external connection
17:03 <~naxxtor> because i was feeling charitable
17:03 <~naxxtor> and didn't think it'd make any different
17:03 <~belial> i wouldnt give shells to random people naxx...
17:04 <~naxxtor> it was on an isolated VM
17:04 <~naxxtor> which i've set up to be a shell server
17:04 <~naxxtor> he had access to nothing
17:04 <~belial> ok
17:04 <~naxxtor> all he did was run irssi
17:04 <&Vesalius> and
17:04 <~belial> but would that not bypass the gline then
17:04 <&Vesalius> symlink bash history
17:04 <&Vesalius> belial, nope
17:04 <&Vesalius> he was glined from that connection
17:05 <~belial> ok
17:05 <&Vesalius> the same one naxxtor was one
17:05 <&Vesalius> he only used it so I couldnt gline him
17:05 <&Vesalius> lol
17:05 <&Vesalius> because it would of glined nax too
17:05 <~naxxtor> ?
17:05 <~belial> he was being an ass on IRC
17:05 <&Vesalius> /gline *m4tr1x*@whatever.plus.com
17:05 <~belial> he got glined, then used the vm you gave him
17:06 <&Vesalius> and got glined again
17:06 <&Vesalius> I glined him
17:06 <&Vesalius> erm
17:06 <&Vesalius> 3 maybe 4 times
17:06 <~belial> to connect so that he couldnt get glined
17:06 <&Vesalius> was so much fun ## If you think thats fun, you should
try out hacking :D
17:06 <&Vesalius> im hoping he will return at some point
17:06 <&Vesalius> so I may gline him further
17:06 <~naxxtor> well all he needs to do is change his config
17:06 <~naxxtor> i've removed his access
17:06 <&Vesalius> his home one is glined too btw
17:06 <~belial> who is l0l?

18:04 <+Zakolus> Hello
18:07 <&Vesalius> ji

Hackervoice, please get off the internet, btw, your forum is sniffed
AGAIN.

I'll leave you with a little response to Belial regarding this post:

As this a open community and everyone knows we try and run a clean ship
here. I would like to inform you about whats been going on in the
background
As you may know we are good friends with psg from CDC and whitedust. With
every person that has a bit of internet recognition develops a following
of asshats who envy him/her.
This one particular asshat has a deathwish for psg. He has spent most of
his time and life trying to own psg. but never got anywere.
he goes by the name of "bones" & "kingpin" and possibly other handels. he
likes to be a lot of people to make himself look like he has friends.
He thinks he is a uber hacker. But all he did was run a well known exploit
on admittedly out of date forums (now have of course been upgraded) to log
passwords!
he also thought it would make him cool to use a c99 shell tongue.gif And
this noob even tryed to run irssi on our shared hosts? I mean WTF did he
really think a host would have irssi ?? is he *that* stupid.
So if you do come across this asswhipe who has an agenda for psg and
possibly myself now dont give him any attention just ignore his skiddy
attacks.
He claims to be a hacker but all hackers hate what he does and he has not
reputation but collects emenies. He thinks he wins but he has nothing to
defend. For us being offline for 2 days is just a ripple in the ocean. He
is not worth my time or anyone elses. HE is nothing, he writes a shitty
Ezine for milw0rm and thinks that will get him instant respect. So what
you took us offline do you think I could be bothered. if all you have to
live up to is pissing hackers off then i wish you all the best.

Now you not only have psg to look out for, the CDC, whitedust. but you
also have the biggest UK hacking community to fear.
well done. so tell me do you feel big?

also i would like to add a further point. Im taking a zero tolerance to
noobs like this from now on. if you remeber "pr0n" yeah he is gone too.
any more will get a ass full of belial tongue.gif
Belial out.

---* we do not envy psg/cdc/whitedust and neither should you.
---* when we did get around to attacking psg it didn't take us long at
     all.
---* please direct me to some of this internet recognition.
---* I like your "never got anywhere line"...
---* what is this well known exploit i used? stop lying to cover your noob
     ass belial.
---* irssi on webhost, dude, does this zine make it look like we are the
     type of people that wouldn't remove logs? anything there is intentional
     for lolz like this..you see, we like to make noobs look like noobs. 
     You don't need any help with that.
---* I don't want respect.
---* rofl, i think its psg, CDC, and whitedust who need to look out for
     me. now fuck off you fat cunt.
---* btw, your mother should have drowned you at birth...look at yourself 
     in a mirror pudding boy!

Hello Hackers! I am elite Romanian hacker. I am the Circle of Lost
Hackers. Is joke: circle begins and ends with me. I am the well educated.
I was in school and taking the English courses. I will unite the
underground. Big concessions (concessions nice word, yes?) are made by
all. Bad guys must stop being so bad, and good guys must stop using good
grammar. Enjoy the Phrack 64!

Some cynics (cynics good word, yes?) complain these type things:

- We are the not qualified to edit: Some or all of we cannot write decent
  English.
- We do not edit: We did not fixed the punctuation, spelling, or grammar
  issues that are prevalent throughout Phrack 64.

Excuse me copy-paste english (love babelfish LOL)

I think you should think outside box, hacker think outside box, to think
through my English.

We not so bad, authors not so good also! Authors make us words
"genericity" and "prophety" when silly authors probably think
"genericalness" and "prophecy"!.

Phrack authors hacker masters of run-on sentences. They do not have my
Romanian skill of simple short sentence! See this eg. from master Phrack
author:

"Instead of going straight to the results of the proposed implementation, 
we may introduce the domain of program analysis, without going deeply
in the theory (which can go very formal), but taking the perspective
of a hacker who is tired of focusing on a specific exploit problem
and want to investigate until which automatic extend it is possible
to find vulnerabilities and generate an exploit code for it without
human intervention."

The part "until which automatic extend" random from a common dictionary,
this method I well know!

My Phrack authors don't much read over their work but we read and we think
pretty good! We think double double word make point DOUBLE STRONG! Phrack
authors much do! "The method which I now propose relies on an undocumented
the undocumented Mac OS X system call".

Phrack has two kinds of authors, and these be them:

Weird foreigner with a small grasp of the English, such as Borat.
American with full sixth-grade education, like as Jethro from The Beverly
Hillbillies.

Before go, Here, good pro-Romanian anti-Bulgarian (boo Bulgara!) joke from
www:

You know the good thing about Romanians? They get shit done! Do you know
why we do not hear about Bulgarian hackers? Because the Romanians are
better! At any given moment, a dozen hackers throughout Bulgaria are
saying "Shit, those fucking Romanians beat me to it!"
 
Your truely,

PHRACK STAFF: Back on action.
PHRACK 64: Someone got do it.

==

If you want readers to imagine you as either Borat or Jethro, continue
writing without reading over your work. Write without editing. Write
without a dictionary. Write without submitting to a native English
speaker. It may become increasingly difficult for me to maintain a high
level of respect for the professionalism of my associates as a whole. 

Thank you, gladio and g463, for contributing fine articles with fine
English. Thank you, Borat and Jethro, for your fine work on the rest of
the articles in Phrack 64.

Oh cypherzero how fun he was with his elite blogs and even more elite
bash/perl scripts. Left us wordless!
Since cypherzero's blogging days are over ( he killed his site :( ) we
should introduce who cypherzero was:

"I'm 22 years old, and I'm a computer hacker that's about to be on the
move by myself to the big city. 
That city is Seattle, and I'm going to live it up, leet hacker style,
bitches."
Obtained from http://www.flickr.com/people/cypherxero/. See we're not
making this stuff up!

"My name is Cody, otherwise known as CypherXero in the digital online
world.
I'm 22 years old, and I live, eat, breathe, and sleep computers.
I've been using computers for over 10 years now, and my main interest is
in networking and security."
Obtained from http://claimid.com/cypherxero

He sure got popular with his "hacking e-zine" called "Exploit this!".
Where he introduced us with elite never by then seen
techniques for BOF attacks, SQL injections, XSS, SE'ing and ARP poisoning.

Thank you so much for the enlightenment, I'm sure it took you
quite some time to rip off code and read 9120083495823 small txts to
assemble that ...zine.
Not only that he was good at writing "educational zines" he was also an
amazing coder; take a look at this wonderful and useful perl script:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# XML Weather
# http://www.cypherxero.net/bin

Yes, he introduced system("echo ") to the programming world! Such
cleverness was never seen before in the history of programming.
He also shows us how to use useless amount of print's to surround 
text with parens and how to use new lines the elite way!

Also his bash is amazing, take a look at this useful bash script:

#!/bin/bash

# Builds a table of hashes and the words that make the hashes
# Uses a wordlist of any kind!

files="`cat $1 | wc | awk '{ print $1}'`"
files="`expr $files + 1`"
linenum="1"
NUM="1"

echo "Now hashing the wordlist..."
echo "This could take awhile..."

while [ "$linenum" != "$files" ]
do
word="`sed ''$NUM'q;d' $1`"
hash="`md5 -d"$word"`"
echo "$hash $word" >> $2
NUM="`expr $NUM + 1`"
linenum="`expr $linenum + 1`"
done

echo "DONE!"

exit 0

In this script Mr. cypherzero shows us how to quote variables in bash just
because that's the elite way foo. 
And that proper tabbing is just lame in bash.
He never get to post his C/C++ programs we can only wonder how elite they
could have been.
He was a great exploit developer his eleet sql injections made it in
milw0rm, SecurityFocus and much more places, and he felt so proud, just
look at him.

Comment from Eric B:
I didn't know you had that credited to you, I thought you were just using
an known exploit on that certain someone's site. Crazy man.


Yes like a kid in a candy store, just that in this case the candies are
the ego-boost and he got it for being such a good boy for reporting a
vulnerability.
He also loved perl, but unfortunately perl didn't love him back thus the
crappy code that made us cry :(

Post from 1:
 Title: Rewriting fuser for perl modules
 I'm going to be rewriting the fuser shell script to handle the download,
compile, and install of perl modules. (from repositories such as <a
href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>)

Oh, and perl kicks ass. If I've learned one thing, it's that I cannot
STAND languages like Java. It's way too bulky and crappy, and for the
things I want to do, shell scripting, perl, and eventually C will suit me
and my programming needs just fine. I'm not out to write a huge
application, but rather tie concepts and code together into small, usable
code.

UPDATE: OK, the fuser for perl (fuserp) script is ready for use! Grab it
<a href="http://www.cypherxero.net/bin/scripts/fuserp">here</a>.

Cypherzero sure knows how to secure php applications, especially
commercial software such as wordpress so retarded script kiddies can't get
him. 

And even if he missed something he can always blame his hosting for being
lame and not patching their vulnerabilities like any good whitehat would
do. 

But unfortunately the evil hackers put so much pressure on him, so he
rm'ed his whole site and his domain doesn't have any DNS records :(
We are sure going to miss his whoring and we'll cry day and night because he
didn't make in the media, guess your whoring wasn't good enough *sniff*
Perhaps someone should take cypherzero's example and do the same before
the evil haqurs get them and embarrass them publicly?
Anyway we were nice enough to provide hosting for cypherzero's blog. It's
just a bunch of .txt's of his posts and comments. Please visit

Now for some useless hash dumping

sub ZAP { ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; my $self = shift; say($self, <<'EOZAP'


-- Introducing ZAP --

Have you ever been in a situation where you based your code
off of another script, yet you didn't want to include its
accompanying copyright notice? Then this is for you.

In this case, you have three options:

  a) Include the notice, because you are lazy and legal.
  b) Rewrite your program from scratch, because you want 
     your due creative recognition.
  c) Simply not include the copyright notice.

These are also known as:

  a) The lame way.
  b) The ego way.
  c) The elite way!

There are various reasons for choosing c. Perhaps you find 
that if you were to start your code fresh, it would be 
similar in expressions and control to the code you had 
before. Further, they would probably do the same thing in
almost the same way. Doing so does not seem fair to you.

Additionally, by including the GPL in your modified program
you have essentially waved moral rights to the code. You
have signed the code over, so to speak, and have willingly
withdrawn your rights to it. 

You might feel a bit ripped off. Afterall, perhaps your 
code is a greater derivation, in both form and concept, 
from your source than that source is from its influences.

A more practical reason exists: Perhaps you hate long,
annoying comments from others in your tool, and heck, you
are an evil hacker who isn't going to let copyright law
alter your practices.

The GPL is one example of a copyleft notice that seeks to 
limit some freedoms to ensure most freedoms. As nice as the
GPL is, for any of the reasons above you may not wish to
abide by its rules. The GPL is not full of loopholes: 
rather, every new version is like the next Terminator, only
stronger. It's out to get you and you cannot stop it. I 
knocked a copy of the GPLv2 into molten steel; it came out
squeaky clean.

If you decide to basically violate the law and not include
a copyright license, you may wish to offer some explanation
for that choice. Thus, we present ZAP.

==intro

<psg> Why are you trying to prove shit to me? You hate me for no reason?! :)
# All IRC quotes taken from conversations not including ZF0 members - we
wouldn't IRC with psg

In ZF02 we had a Call For 0wning in which we detailed how Mark Hinge, aka
psg, aka |PaRiS|, aka Voshika, aka any other gay nick, needed to be owned.
Allow us to tell you a little story of how he and his bum buddy Mark
Anderson (aka Cronus) got owned through the roof. We call this story "Two
Marks don't make a Right".

These two young fools spent the 1990s pretending to be hackers. Cronus was
a lead contributor to the Discordant Opposition Journals (DOJ), which
never produced any technical content. psg contributed to the Syndicate of
London Journal/Annuals (soljo, maybe "solja" was too feminine for them),
which also has not produced anything intelligent. However, these two
wankers wave their journals around as their hacker cred. Collectively we
may refer to these two, and their chav friends like fwaggle, steinsky,
and chickensoup, as the Syndicate of London (SoL).

We are unable to find any period in time in which SoL actually did
anything. As far as their written record goes, it seems they claimed to be
hackers, and then wrote some shitty zines talking about how they were
hackers. I term these men "fake hackers"! Seriously, they knew how to type
and how to use the internet in the early 90s. Congratulations fucktards.

Let's flash-forward a few years. Enter 2005. They still hadn't
accomplished anything. But then Cronus (that's Mark Anderson, in case you
have forgotten already!) decided to make some money off of being a fake
hacker. So he put the capital behind whitedust.net and got psg (Mark
Hinge) to be the lead bitch. It was supposed to be the world's best
independent online security news source. However, it completely lacked
legitimacy. The Marks did not actually know any real hackers, and could
not be ahead of the pack for news. They became resellers and relinkers of
news that appeared on other sites. They would also try to create news or
add unoriginal commentary to try to appear unique. They also tried to
support unprofessional news items to get more hits, and would desperately
attempt to get slashdot and other sites to link to them. They wrote their
own Wikipedia articles about themselves to try to increase their profile.

<psg> and *I* "mispresent hackers" <- sure do

Whitedust has never been taken seriously by hackers (except those of us
who were serious about owning it!)

From then to now they have only become worse.

Just to clarify, we are not among the groups accusing SoL of "selling
out". They never had anything to sell. Had they been talented, hell yes
they sold out!

The fake hackers searched desperately for ways to make money off of being
fake hackers. They started hakedspace, err, I mean "hakspace", a
myspace-like site in an attempt to lure the 13 year old virgin fake
hackers of the internet to generate ad revenue for themselves. They took
all of their shitty content over the years and put it into a book, and
have desperately tried to sell a copy.

They tried to host a hacker conference in September 2007. As we have seen,
that didn't happen.

The SoL are trying as hard as possible to make as much money as they can
off of kids and/or php coders who don't know enough about hacking to
realise how full of shit the SoL are. These kids will find themselves
mislead and not provided with quality information. These kids will start
to think they are just as hackerific as Cronus and psg, while really just
learning how to be just as shitty.

<psg> I am not a hacker... i am a marketeer.

That quote is refreshingly honest. It would be more pleasing to see it on
the "About" page of Whitedust than in a small IRC chat where it may not
have ever been repeated.

Now psg tries to backtrack and be like "I wasn't actually aware any of 
the wd staff ever claimed to be hackers anyways". Let's see if I can
think of any examples...wait a second, how about that time you wrote
your own Wikipedia article, and then put yourself in Wikipedia's
category "British Hackers"?

Check it: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Hinge&oldid=69843817


==fresh

So, shortly before our release, SoL found out they were owned. But they
are still fuckin' hilarious with how they try to deal with that. They
wrote a self-deprecating post for the sites.

Their big ace in the hole was that they had some emails with KODD. See,
after KODD owned them, KODD was contacted for some purposes. Now, SoL
claims that the KODD email had actually been expired, and after the own
SoL picked it up. Maybe that's how it happened. Yet, I think you'll agree
that that was unlikely and is probably just another lie. First, it takes
time for hushmail accounts to expire. Second, if that was true, and they
had just stolen the account from KODD, then the only way KODD wouldn't 
know is if they never even tried to log in. Despite making a defacement 
and passing around the email, would they really not check it? Doubt it.
Would they not change their website to indicate a new email? Doubt it.

It is more acceptable to conclude that either KODD got pissed off that
whitedust was owned without them, and then passed the emails to WD; or 
that KODD has some serious overlap with the SoL core, and/or directly 
*is* SoL, vis-a-vis the '99 days.

Either way that is the risk you take when you share with other people, 
and that is a risk that was well prepared for. WD doesn't really mention
it, but those emails did not contain any compromising information.
"Chest-beating" existed to obfuscate vagueness.

So basically the entire post was a story leading up to their great trump,
the emails! 

How they dealt with the own is just funny. In order to make our work
seem less impressive, they started detailing just how many times they
know they have been hacked. It was like "$A hacked us through phpizabi.
Then $B hacked us through phpizabi. Then $C hacked us through phpizabi
and defaced us. So then we figured it was time to stop ignoring our 
lack of security. And then $D owned us through completely unguarded
input. So $E really isn't that special."

It gets more hilarious as they failed to realise how big the problem was.
Despite the email clearly saying that we had owned Whitedust itself,
they simply didn't get that when we own we 0wn. They wrote their text
without realizing that we could destroy them in any number of ways at
any moment in time.

It's easy for them to blame phpizabi or to say that psg was the victim
this time. What they need to realise to survive in this world is that
every single person along the line failed them. They have security issues
at any level you can have an issue at. They barely have a grip on XSS, 
let alone an idea of how to handle SQL input or other user-defined input.
They don't know how to manage or maintain the integrity of files. They
don't know how to design things to limit the damage from a single breach.
They don't know how to find secure web applications nor how to write 
their own. They did not do a single thing in all of our research that
impresses us. We will detail or hint at much of these issues below, but
many of them will stay with us as our own personal collection of 
Whitedust 0day. The first thing they could do to help the problem is
scrap WD3 entirely and hire someone competent to make a fresh CMS.

And, jake, you stupid sheep-raping wanker you, it was CF0 and ZF0. With
zeroes, not O's. Get it? Zero for 0wned? The 0 means 0wned? Right? Right?

Fucking retards. On with the show.

==hakspace.net

Hakspace is the place to start, simply because it was very publicly
humiliated. Basically the Marks decided to use a very shitty piece of open
source software as their lame management system. This LMS was full
of hilarious holes. It didn't take us any time to own it and find
ourselves exploring. However, this is not anything to brag about, since a
few other groups or individuals have done the same. One group, the
Knights of Dynamic Discord (KODD), decided to deface the website. See
their text at http://kodd.66ghz.com/18.txt. 

Cronus and psg were so stupid that they either didn't bother taking a look
at the LMS they wanted to use to power their hakspace, or they simply were
too incompetent to see how poor the code was. Either way they deserved a
good owning, and that's what they got. There is no need for us to go into
much detail in this area.

After hakspace got owned:

[ WD Manifesto ] "From this point on we will not indulge in juvenile
destructive squabbling that plagues the web" 
[ ZF0 roffles  ] "Yes you will, just on the losing side!"

Let's have a small tour through their database from before the defacement.

 congrats. Hakspace looks good so far.

Invite everyone you know.

Post it on forums.

Submit it to Slashdot until they give in a post it! :)

scripts,
 computers suit my mind.

 I will not claim any elite skillz beyond my passion.

I will always prefer computers to people.  I will purse my major and then
continue with computer engineering, assembly is of particular interest.

Well said.

I guess I never pinned you as the computer science sort of person, but I
guess that goes for stereotyping.  My apologies if calling you a
dominatrix
 offended you, I&#039;m a wee ignorant on the subject and I&#039;m not
sure if there is a distinction I&#039;m unaware of.

Elite skills seem to be something born in movies and book.  People are
only as good as the things they do regularly and the fabled
d00d-can-get-into
-anything is so elusive I doubt the existence.

In your statement, &quot;Consider me below your standards&quot; I hope you
don&#039;t mean me, personally.  I&#039;m afraid my message may have seem
ed hostile.  It wasn&#039;t intended to be.  I merely sent the message
from boredom at work and curiosity since I haven&#039;t really talked to
you 
before.

Are you going to school for programming, or is it just a hobby?

What languages are are you experienced with?
Which languages are you a novice with?

I suppose it wouldn&#039;t be fair to sound like an interviewer, so
I&#039;ll say a little about myself.

I&#039;m commonly known as Comrade Smack, though people who know me
personally call me XaQ (pronounced: zuh-ack).  Information Systems
Security is m
y thing and I am going to school for it.  I&#039;m 20.	I&#039;ll be
getting an associates degree in June for Computer Networking and I&#039;ll
be g
etting a Bachelors in Information Systems Security in June 2009.  I work
at a retail store as the IT department.  I have my own office, it&#039;s a

pretty sweet rig (pictures coming soon).

I currently have a few projects going.	One seems to be a large step in
the direction of Hacktivism, another is just &quot;the next MySpace.&quot;
 
The first one has to do with using steganography with network traffic,
details I can&#039;t really go into.  I don&#039;t want to compromise the
mis
sion.  The second one isn&#039;t a social networking site, but I think has
a niche that should allow for massive expansion, though I think I&#039;m 
keeping it &quot;underground&quot; via invitation-only and amongst
friends. <-- Check out his elite hacker projects

I guess I&#039;m bored at work again and felt like chatting.

OK enough lame hakspace stuff. We figured it wasn't even worth logging
unless we couldn't find a quicker way to own WD. Either way it got defaced
immediately.

==endofdayz.net

End of Dayz is the name of the stupid book that psg decided to put
together. We owned this site. Well, there really isn't much to own: check
out some ls:

Mark Anderson is very bad at everything he does, including webdesign. In
this case there is a ton of code reuse and css reuse. Poor poor Mark. He's
not a hacker, he's not even a PHP coder.

==www.irelandmortgages.com

Another poor attempt by Anderson to get in on making money.

We didn't actually know that he worked for this company. When did we find
out, you ask? Well, we answer, we found out when we were reading the
database for whitedust.net (omg spoiler: Whitedust is coming!). Anderson
felt it was wise to include absolutely all of their data in the same
database as whitedust.net uses.

We think it is important for the customers of www.irelandmortgages.com
(don't forget the www lawl) to know the stupidity of the people they are
trusting money and information with. 

A great sign of poor management is when you try to go to the website
without a 'www' and this is what you see:

Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-connect]: Access denied for user
'apache'@'localhost' (using password: NO) in
/home/steps2home/domains/irelandmortgages.com/public_html/ink/includes/cDa
tabase.php on line 46
Could not connect: Access denied for user 'apache'@'localhost' (using
password: NO)

In case you were wondering about passwords, here they are:

INSERT INTO `im2_users` VALUES (1, 'mark', 'landl0rd', 'Mark Anderson',
'me@markanderson.ie', 0);
INSERT INTO `im2_users` VALUES (14, 'brendan', 'brendan', 'Brendan Kelly',
'info@irelandmortgages.com', 0);
INSERT INTO `im2_users` VALUES (17, 'Eileen', 'rachel8', 'Eileen Egan',
'Eileen@irelandmortgages.com', 0);
INSERT INTO `im2_users` VALUES (26, 'jean@irelandmortgages.com', 'Oisin',
'Jean Boyle', 'jean@irelandmortgages.com', 0);

We didn't actually ask Mark why he chose such a password (and feels so
strongly about using it elsewhere), but if we did this might have been his
response:

<Cronus> The 0 is for 0wned.

The database is horrendous, it has hundreds of lines that look like this:

INSERT INTO `im2_appform3` VALUES (406, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '
', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''
, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '');

In case you wondered, there are eight appforms. I think they actually
differ by a couple of extra fields.

We have a ton of info on any www.irelandmortgages.com customers. Here is a
small idea of what we may have:

(Rest of list cutoff: Pointless).

Watch them keep up to date on your properties:

INSERT INTO `im2_finalvaluation` VALUES (294, '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '');
(Almost the entire table looks like that)

On all of the clients, we have this kind of information:

INSERT INTO `im2_overview` VALUES (221, '', '', 'Client already owns a PDH
and an Investment property in celbridged valued at 700k with a sma
ll mortgage oustanding on PDH.	Current mortgage with Irish Nationwide. 
Requires 100k to buy 2 sites in limerick and will cross secure with 
existing properties', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '13',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '
', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '');

and this kind of information!

INSERT INTO `im2_overview2` VALUES (229, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '');

and of course the classic:

INSERT INTO `im2_overview3` VALUES (401, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '',
'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '
');

Of course, anything they have ever done with their customers is stored in
this db. Like so:

INSERT INTO `im2_salestasks` VALUES (297, 0, '', '1150070461', 'Followup
with Sean White (get him to contact his doctor re PMA report (go bac
k to Paul in Eagle Star)', 1, 1, '12', '6', '2006', 'Brendan Kelly');

Customers need to ask themselves some question.

1. Why does the owner use his first name as a password?
2. Why does the coder use the same password as he uses elsewhere?
3. Why do none of the four employees use a password longer than eight
   characters?
4. Why are we employing a coder who pretends to be a hacker in his spare
   time?
5. Why is our database being stored with the database of a site that has
   been publicly targetted by hackers?
6. Why are these passwords not hashed?
7. What kind of lame hack wrote this site and designed this database?
8. Why did I decide to give my money to these chavs in the first place,
   especially as they only act as a middle-man for mortgages?

Brenden Kelly has apparently spent 17 years in the financial services
sector, but is new to teh internets!

Yes, this database if full of crap. 27,000 lines of crap. But mixed in all
of that crap there is personal information for all of the customers. We
are not going to do anything malicious with the information at our hands.
But that doesn't mean that nobody else will (or possibly already has). 

We feel that this service did a fine job of representing itself as safe,
and users had no specific reason to expect it to get hacked. It is our
opinion that these clients (should they exist) should be contacted and
have the situation explained to them.

If someone would like to take this noble task upon themselves, here is
some contact information. Some of the data has been cutoff and there are
duplicates (why?), but...noone cares.

==The Black and White Ball

Some of you may remember this ill-fated attempt to make money. In February
2007 Whitedust announced they were hosting a hacker conference in
September. It was to be split into "Whitehat" and "Blackhat" sections. In
July the website changed to a one-page message saying that the conference
had to be cancelled due to banking difficulties. The duo then proceeded to
never mention the conference again.

For anybody suspicious about this, here is the real reason the B&W Ball
had to be cancelled:

-- 
-- Table structure for table `bw_tickets`
-- 

CREATE TABLE `bw_tickets` (
  `TicketID` bigint(10) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `TicketRand` varchar(15) default NULL,
  `Name` varchar(100) default NULL,
  `Company` varchar(100) default NULL,
  `Address` text,
  `Telephone` varchar(100) default NULL,
  `Fax` varchar(100) default NULL,
  `Email` varchar(100) default NULL,
  `fAllAccess` tinyint(1) default NULL,
  `fWhite` tinyint(1) default NULL,
  `fBlack` tinyint(1) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`TicketID`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=4 ;

-- 
-- Dumping data for table `bw_tickets`
-- 

INSERT INTO `bw_tickets` VALUES (1, '123456789012345', 'Mark Anderson',
'Mercury Software', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `bw_tickets` VALUES (2, '253453453645645', 'Mark Hinge',
'Pirates Inc.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, NULL);
INSERT INTO `bw_tickets` VALUES (3, '563524352342343', 'Peter Prickett',
'Pricket & Co', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1);

-- --------------------------------------------------------

That's right, the only tickets they "sold" were to Cronus, psg, and
chickensoup. 

Check out how Peter Prickett is the blackhat of SoL.

Is it just me or were the talks on the blackhat panel no different from
the talks on the whitehat panel?

Why did the ball find itself so unpopular? Let's suggest some points:

- It was hosted over four days. This was probably to get as much money as
  possible from attendees drinking. 
- Only one talk running at a time.
- It held only 20 talks in total.
- These talks were lame.
- You could see half the speakers in Defcon.
- They stole the name from Defcon.
- Whitedust has no credibility.
- Whitedust's legions of 14 year old virgins/wannabes/php coders can't
  afford a con
- People in the security industry don't want to go to a conference with no
  new material
- The cost was 320 euros!

psg lacks understanding - "You'd spend that much if you went to the black
hat briefings though... the difference between a corporate conference and
the defcon side event... and B&W is longer."

Sure, you could pay less to go for only two days and see half the shitty
talks. Or you could pay 1/5 of the price to go to Defcon and see many more
talks, generally of a higher quality, and be able to choose what to see
out. The quality of talk at the B&W Ball called for a small entrance fee,
if you are in the 320 euro range then you need to have a higher quality of
talks, or at least something new, to attract corporate slaves.

All of the speakers either signed up for the free trip or because they
wanted to pad their resume with yet another talk this year.

Of course, this could easily be an area where the Whitedust folks lie about,
because it is kind of embarassing. Maybe they'll say that people could not
be added until the banking issues were cleared up, and that these were
only free tickets. However, the link for Tickets was still up, with an email
address to contact to arrange financial information. Can anyone say they
actually tried that, and were told to wait a bit while details were sorted
out?

Check out the security through obscurity!

Now that we have seen the ins and outs of WD3, let's take a trip back in
time. Conveniently they neither package their backups nor make them
unviewable from the web.

file organization skills.

$ cat backup20070101/101/.htaccess
Options -MultiViews
ErrorDocument 404 //101/base.php
Options -MultiViews
ErrorDocument 404 //time.php

Although the backdoor could have been inserted at any time, the .htaccess
looks like it was built for the original setup.

Allow us to save you the time decoding the base64.

aHR0cDovL2Jpcy5pZnJhbWUucnUvbWFzdGVyLnBocD9yX2FkZHI9 :
http://bis.iframe.ru/master.php?r_addr=
aHR0cDovLw== : http
dXNlcjkubXNodG1sLnJ1 : user9.mshtml.ru
dXNlcjcuaHRtbHRhZ3MucnU= : user7.htmltags.ru

So, some elite Russian hax0rs owned Whitedust and added four php files to
the directory. They then added a .htaccess with custom 404s to make it
even easier for them. That easily could be from some mass 0wning tool.

How the hell did Whitedust not notice this? Could the backdoors be any
more obvious?  Even if just one was found it should have lead to the
others being noticed immediately. Did Cronus and psg just _never_ check
out their website files, or review their code, let alone do any security
checks?

Now let's check out the July backups.

Thank God Cronus lacked the skills to write his own forum!

In case one wanted to know, there was 28MB of session data from the
backup directories. I suppose the Whitedust folks thought it was important
to keep that information.


O hai! db time!

The WD db is fat. Babe Ruth fat. As you can guess, it is bloody full of
everything ever produced on whitedust.net. Which just isn't cool. Not only
that, but they have spam in their db. Lots of it. Please clean the porn
spam out, for the next guy who wants to go through this.

We can still find some fun for you.

taken up to try to make it look like they have supporters.

OK enough DB. Nothing else fun at all, unless you think Whitedust news
pages are fun. And if you do we probably don't want to know you.

It's time for some less Cronus and more psg. 

psg's emails are boring. Lots of spam. Lots of lame
myspace/facebook/securityfocus/eveonline. And he deletes stuff quickly
(score one for psg!). So this is about the only thing to entertain you at
all, our little Hinge family get together for a murder mystery.

Subject:	UK Scene
Body:	Hey man, I just read your reply to my blog comment.

I really want to do everything I can to facilitate the growth of the UK
scene. It's only in the last 6 or 7 months that I've started to look into
the UK scene - I guess there comes a point where everyone wants to
associate themselves with people like themselves through choice rather
than through courtesy formed from proximity.

I've met a few people over hvr, and have tried (and failed) to arrange a
meet in Leeds. I'll be frequenting the Manchester 2600 meet for the first
time this month, but I really want to bring new people to the scene. I
figured that a good place would be to start would be looking at activist
groups in the UK (especially Human rights groups) from all different
areas, introducing them to programs such as Torpark and scatterchat and
getting them to acknowledge the importance of the internet as a means of
communication and organisation. From this collaboration I hope people with
similar interests to ourselves, who shy away from particular 'agendas',
will see that there is a society without such alliances that they can fall
back on. Maybe that last point isn't so clear? When I went to Uni I ended
up getting involved with the Socialist workers party. I felt like I wanted
to get 'involved' and they swept me up. After a while I realised that they
weren't for me and left - only to get approached by the anarchist
federation and then worlwiderevolution. All the time, I felt a need to get
involved, but never found the 'UK Scene' to facilitate it. I've got more
from the US 2600/EU scene in the last 6 months than I did from 3 years in
association with these groups.

You are without a doubt, a key member of the UK scene. I've seen your name
on every portal I've visited, so I need to ask you - do you think I've got
a chance? What do you think of my plan? You are obviously involved a lot
more than me, and if you think my efforts would be put to better use, I'll
happily take my lead from you. I know that sounds a bit sheepish, but I
really want help build the scene, for the scene and the people yet to
come. This is bigger than you and me, but you have been involved for
longer and will have a better understanding of what it needs.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

st3x

We need a new mop though.

is no money in the house) and I will make nice kebab things for dinner. Oh

tomato's as well.

You are getting all my money when I get paid at the end of the month - as 
per.

What you then do with that money is up to you.

Because that is what WE agreed.

Whatever you told Laura has nothing to do with me because it wasn't what I

agreed so don't really want to hear about it :)

lol! couldn't have put it better myself!

the main point of this is that we'll be fine. worst comes to the worst, we

find somewhere with one nice big bedroom for £700 a month including 
bills, which is only £100 more than we're paying now, and which we'll 
both soon easily have. and we get all the excitement of moving all over 
again. and she will be back at home with her parents doing her washing. 
again.

checking it out, they even have places exactly like that on our road, and 
the road in between that links our side with jon and claire's side. we're 
going to be fine. she, on the other hand, can do as she damn well pleases 
:)

did you find your food?

smiles and kisses :)

grab us a film or something on the way home, and we can finish off those 
biscuits after dinner and have a really nice night? Lots of stroking and 
cuddles and stuff?

- that sounds nice.

ps. can we pls have no arguing :(

^ We haxed you, now your wireless does not work so well!
^ I REQUEST STROKING AND CUDDLES AND NO ARGUING

Alright, so you're not that bad :P

I know you know I'm there if you need me, but I also know there's a lot of

things that other people can/could understand or help you with that I 
can't, not because I don't want to, but because I don't know how to, and I

don't even know if you'd want me to try. But I'm still there, and if you 
want to even talk or anything I'm happy to listen, although I can't help.

As for this week, I'm proud of you, and you know I am. I'm sorry I've had 
worky stuff going on as well, so I haven't necessarily voiced it as much 
as I maybe should have. I want you to feel happy, because you're amazing 
and you deserve to :)

And please stop saying you think I'm thinking about leaving you. I know we

fight and stuff, but you're the best thing to ever happen to me, because 
you're the only person who would give me the chance to settle down and 
relax, even though I'm not the easiest person to deal with sometimes, and 
I fully acknowledge this. I don't think anyone else could have done.

The only thing you said wrong there was that i KNOW you want me. I don't. 
As far as we go, that's the only thing I need reassurance on, ever. I know

we will fix this eventually, and I know you've got a lot else going on, 
and I know I'm probably focusing on this because everything else is SO 
perfect, but maybe thats just what I do! :)

The only reason I tried to explain to you how personally I take it is so 
you know why I react the way I do, and you understand how upset I get just

so you can tread gently around it and avoid any arguments...it wasn't 
meant to be any sort of personal attack on you.

I'm just a bit scared by the idea of everything being fine, cos then 
things can only really get worse. I'm negative, and I'm sorry.

I want all that stuff as much as, if not more than you do.

Wow. You're amazing. And I think I love you more, I' just much worse at 
showing it! :)

You wanna go to the pub tonight and then just go home? I mean, if you want

other people to come back that's cool, but I'm up for drinking then coming

home if you are? Feel free to pick up a bottle of something today if 
you're out so we canstart before we leave!

Just relax... don't try. You're here and nice and safe with me; you know I

wouldn't do anything to actually hurt you, you know I will always be 
here... try not to focus on the one thing that isn't 100%. I have never 
tried so hard to be such a good boyfriend, indeed friend to someone. I 
love you.

I am over whatever problems I had now; I just want you to feel like you 
can behave normally and don't have to plan things or get overly upset when

the plan you've made doesn't go exactly the way you thought it would; you 
can have me for the rest of your life; a few nights, even weeks will make 
little difference... this problem will sort itself out over time being as 
it is born out of pervious circumstances (both of ours).

^ lol we'll see about that!

I understand you want to come home and things just happen and tbh I'd like

that too; not overly comfortable with the hippo on the sofa around but tbh

I could easily get over that! But please please please try to understand 
that I have a lot going on work wise etc atm and although I am cool calm 
and collected on the outside you can't even imagine the mess in here... It

takes me a while to wind down after work. I am currently redrawing up a 
lot of the rules and direction I had in life; to incorporate a few new 
feelings I have, many of them to do with you (see later on in this msg).

Someone very very close to me died less than two months ago; I am still 
finding that hard to deal with, in many respects as I am the friend other 
people go to when they need to talk, I tend not to talk to them about my 
issues, on some levels I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to anymore.

And I know you'd do anything to help me :) but I just need an external 
kick up the ass sometimes and I am having to get used to the fact that the

person I used to rely on to do that isn't here anymore.

^ So you talk about your issues online to other myspace ladies!

I miss them. It's going to take time.

In the last week I achieved two of my major ambitions in life; and I think

I deserve to be able to feel a little happier about them than I do this 
morning. What I've done this week, to me, is like being chosen for the 
Olympics if I were a runner or elected to parliament; it justify's 
everything iv've ever done and sacarificed to get here.

^ Those two ambitions were End of Dayz being published and the cDc invite!
^ psg needs to achieve some real life goals

Sex isn't a big deal atm because I have so much going on; but I garuntee 
you it will be again! OBVIOUSLY! Deep down you KNOW I want you.

And with all due respect, the fact I want to have sex with you is NOT the 
reason you are my girlfriend. The reason you are my girlfriend is 
everything else about you that I love. The fact I find you very attractive

(Random Fit Girl) is part of that yes, but it's not the major reason I am 
with you.

I am with you because of the person you are not what you look like.

You make me want to have babies and weddings and a patio and matching 
dinner sets. No one else has ever and likely will ever manage that; it's a

part of me I did not think existed. I'd give up everything to make that 
happen - you and me are the most stabilising reassuring thing that has 
ever happened to me.

You're not an idiot, but you do just need to trust me and stop worrying so

much - but I can wait for you to do that.

^ Trusting psg is bad, we will see!

I just need you to be gentle and understanding back sometimes when I lack 
in certain areas.

I love you more xxx 

########################################

Three months later the problem was not resolved!

Remember that the _bottom_ post is the first.

########################################

I wasn't asking for a well structured argument from you. I'm already well
aware that you're an incredible boyfriend, and that sometimes you just w
ant to talk, etc, and I appreciate that a hell of a lot more than I think
you realise. I think any girl would.

All I was asking for was for you to understand why I get so upset, and why
I hate being scheduled in for the end of the night, just in case you HA
PPEN to feel like it then. Hows about you try just relaxing, thinking
about it, and maybe let someone else make you WANT to do things like that?

Or even if you don't want that, try thinking that maybe the other person
might quite like it if you just showed them that sort of attention, and p
referably not on the one night they're incapably drunk? I don't think any
couple ever got by on the premise that it's always one person's entire c
hoice what happens and when. People don't always want the same thing at
the same time. That's a human fact, shouldn't be something that's allowed 
to undermine an entire relationship, which, lets face it, this is doing.

I don't have any complaints at all about what goes on whenever stuff does
happen, but maybe if you were nicer to me it wouldn't bother me that it'
s not as often. Seeing as I'm being seriously honest here, whenever we
start anything I never know from the beginning whether you're even going
to
 come near me or not during it. Maybe if that were different it wouldn't
bother me so much how often it was, but I'm not allowed say that cos then
 you get all 'unrelaxed' and accuse me of pressuring you. I can't really
win.

Doesn't matter any more anyway. Like I said, your call. We've tried to fix
this so many times and I have no energy left for it. We can either leav
e it altogether, or I'll just accept thing as they are and won't ever ask
any questions about whatever else goes on. Because I love you enough to 
make THAT sort of a compromise.

I'm not supposed to have to say this, it's something you're supposed to
work out for yourself. But this is so easily fixable, it's just not me tha
t can do it any more. So the ball's kind of in your court.

Love you though x

> Look, I don't know exactly what's going on right now.

Nothing is going on - I am very stressed about work and that about it.
Unless there is something going on with you that you haven't told me
about?

^^^^^ I thought you were over your problem?

> All I'm asking for is the same thing that every other girl in the world
wants....a nice bloke, who like her, and who'll occasionally do nice thi
ngs like cook, who doesn't think any sort of physical intimacy with her is
the worst thing in the world, and generally just wants to be with her.

You have a nice bloke - who do you know who is as nice as me? Who loves
you and will do anything you ask him to do. I don't think physical intmacy
 is the worst thing in the world - saying that is just stupid - sometimes
I just want a hug and to sit and TALK with you thought, because I love y
ou... I do want to be with you; I am running out of ways to explain that
to you.

^^^^^ I think we've found ourselves a FAGGOT

> I thought we had all that, except for one thing. And I can usually deal
with that. I don't understand it, and it upsets me, but I can deal with 
it as long as it isn't brought up and constantly rubbed in. You know this
cos we really had a nice few weeks. And that's cos I love you enough to 
let that one stupid thing go, cos I kept thinking one day we'd fix
it...either when we left your grandad's, or when I moved job, etc.

There is nothing to fix. I love you I fancy you, if you stopped worrying
about it for 10 mins then it would be fine, as it is I feel under pressur
e; it need not be like that at all.

^^^^^ I think she thinks there is something to fix. Like...your sex life!

> But today I'm sitting here feeling the worst I think I have felt since
I've been with you, cos I don't understand how me getting upset about one
 such basic thing which you keep telling me is fixed anyway can result in
you being so upset and having such a go at me, it doesn't seem very fair
.

I was not upset. That was well beyond my control. I did not want that to
happen did I? And I never had a go at you; I just need you to understand.

^^^^^ I'm not beating you, I'm just making you understand!

> If the very thought of having to come near your girlfriend makes you as
unhappy as you were last night, then maybe you need to find yourself ano
ther girlfriend.

That's ridiculus. I don't want anyone else; and I got upset because you
shouted at me for going to turn the heating off. Nothing to do with coming
 near you which I quite wanted to do at the time before you screamed at me
in front of Adrian.

> I just hate feeling like this. I'm not the most unattractive person in
the world,

You're beautiful.

>and I'm not the worst girlfriend,

I am far from the worst boyfriend.

^^^^^^^^ Stick up for yourself when you don't need to, huh?

> and I hate that last night you were so upset,

I don't know why that happened.

> when I'm sure there's a thousand other girls who have done a thousand
times worse. And yet Charlotte just took me shopping to try and cheer me u
p and I ended up in tears in a changing room cos some stupid pair of
trousers didn't fit, and that's not what I do.

Being as upset as last night isn't generally what I do either.

> I know you need to relax before we can be okay, but I've tried so hard
to help you do that, and it hasn't got anywhere, and now I'm so paranoid 
that I can't relax either, and I need fixing,

That's what I am good for.

^^^^^ Apparently not.

> and you'd rather leave me or let me leave, because that's how much you
don't wanna come near me.

That is not true at all.

^^^^^ It's worse than we thought. psg has straight-sex-aphobia.

> Basically I'm saying this can't be fixed through trying to make each
other relax, cos I'm not in a position to try and relax you any more, and
I
'm pretty sure that you're not going to try and relax me...as you've said
yourself, if you don't want to you're not going to.

Point taken. I will do my best; I am sorry ok? :(


> We either completely leave this whole sex thing, to the point where if
you wanna sleep with other people thats fine, I just don't wanna know abo
ut it, or we just leave the entire thing. Your choice.

I don't want anyone else.

Just in case you were about to reply to that last message, please don't
bother. I've just been really sick, I'm completely exhausted, and my head'
s just fuzzy, I don't wanna talk to argue or anything any more.

I'm going to come straight home after work, have a shower, get changed,
etc. If I feel any better, I'm going to go to the pub, you're more than we
lcome to either come or go out with your friends. If I don't, I'm just
going to go to bed and hope I wake up tomorrow feeling okay. Likewise,
don'
t feel obliged to stay with me if you wanna go out or whatever.

I'll see you at half five. Any vaguely nice response to this would be

If your intentions are that of the light then you hinder not - you nor I
see the full consequences and benefits of our actions, all we have to do 
is that which we feel is right.

You emotions are you ally - not your enemy.

If they get involved, enjoy the moments.

Life is but a series of moments; how you remember them, and ultimately it
is a choice you can make.


Realistically what do you have to fear?

There is nothing stronger than what you have right there in your soul.

Relax.

It's fun.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

True. But sometimes I help and I hinder, and when I hinder I help. That is
still the tricky part, and not considering my emotions sometimes get in
volved. Natural right? I hope I do right then, but fear is the mind

Thank you thank you, we'll be in town all week.

On a serious note, we decided to, yah know, well...not rm everything.

This shouldn't seem like much of a surprise, because we don't do much
rming to begin with.

But psg was so tempting. You just know that even after getting owned
they'll lie about it. Hard to do that when you've got a big void where 
all your websites used to be. That was the nice thing about seeing 
hakspace defaced.

However, we're friendy, helpful hackers. We are an educational zine! 
There are about three dozen clueless 13 year old talentless virgin php 
coders out there who buy into these guys, and we hope some day they will 
grow out of it peacefully. But that's just a joke, not a real reason to 
not rm whitedust.

These guys are hurting themselves. They are crashing and burning, step by
step. They had a bit of success when they first started and were modest 
in their content, and when slashdot didn't yet know not to link to their 
articles. But they've got worse and have also been slowly discovered as 
the frauds they are, by many people. According to them, 2007 has held
many more hits than 2006, but if that is true then it's just a sign of
being known, while underneath that topsoil the hollow hole that forms their 
content base continues to widen.

"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake." 
- Napoleon Bonaparte

I personally would rather watch Whitedust crumble and die entirely through
its own lack of quality, in a slow and painful death that depresses psg, 
instead of taking it out and giving him an out.

But that's just my opinion, not necessarily yours. I'm not one to tell
others what to think...

These guys know nothing about security, and have nothing of quality to 
contribute, yet they are trying to plagarise and create security news.

If they do get better and survive, then good for them. The system works,
and we have once again done our jobs as internet superheroes.

UPDATE: psg quit. Congratulations to Whitedust, psg, and everyone else!
        Now we await Cronus quitting.

sub Unmaskunmask { ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; my $self = shift; say($self, <<'EOUNMASK'

unmask.py blows.

The code is shit. Considering that it is only one of seven sources listed
on http://www.immunitysec.com/resources-freesoftware.shtml, and that the
others are mostly Python too, we can reasonably conclude that Dave Aitel
codes like shit. Maybe if you pay for non-free software from Dave Aitel
you will get something better.

"By releasing tools, such as these, we hope to demonstrate our knowledge
leadership, and give back to the security community as a whole."

It is horribly incomplete and doesn't do all the things it says it does.
You are better off entirely ignoring the comments Aitel wrote, because
they are LIES. How could he give this a 1.0 version number? It isn't even
0.1 unless you're living in the 90s.

Here's how it actually gets a score from two stores:

---
Take the 100 most common words from both and compare. Add the amount that
match. So, that's a possible 100 points.

Take the 100 most common (continuous or non-continuous) doubles in
sentences (where the phrase "I like dogs. I am." would form doubles of "I
like", "I dogs", "like dogs" and "I am"). Add the amount of those that
match.

Do the same for triples.
---

So you have a highest possible score of 300. Don't be fooled into thinking
scores are a percentage.

It entirely ignores punctuation, sentence length, and other things he said
were used.

Now, take me for example. I try to write short sentences using simple
words. So my singles list is packed with words that are less than five
chars long. These, from two texts, match at a ridiculous rate. Look at
this paragraph itself, words including "take me for I try to write words
so my list is with that are less than from two at a", most of those 20+
words will be in my most common word lists in both texts.

Then take the doubles and triples. It would make a bit of sense if it was
only continuous words, but it isn't. So in anything except for very short
sentences, all the doubles list suggests is, again, your most common
words. My doubles list would be full of combinations of the above example
short words.

It's basically taking how similar your basic vocabulary is and multiplying
that by three.

----


Here are some ideas to cause unmask fun:

In one text, write always with "I", and in the other always write with
"we". Use very short sentences. That will leave your singles almost the
same but will destroy your doubles and triples values, so you should be
able to drop your score 10 points in a bad situation and much much more if
your sentences are short enough.

Misspell common words and they will be cut out of the results, lowering
your scores in general.

See, Aitel was a dumbass and decided to not match words that aren't words.
I can understand how he wants to remove non-text data, but even if he just
held onto text that matched something like /\b[a-z]{5,}\b/ he could catch
a lot of words that are spelt wrong and would increase the accuracy of his
script. Unfortunately, regex is probably a bit too much for Aitel in
general.

Ever wonder why it takes so long to build such massive stores? Ask
yourself, did Dave Aitel think to just store the most common 100 keys of
his lists (the data he actually uses), or did he decide to store 
everything?

Ask yourself, if I add one word to a sentence, although that will create
just one more single item, how many more doubles and triples will it
create? Could I possibly make unmask.py hang for half an hour and take up
50mb with just a short essay that lacks punctuation?

----

It is interesting that the script works pretty well. The reason is does so
is because vocabulary does mean a lot. By compounding it he expands the
differences between different people. The more you match, the more your
score will increase by in a non-linear way. So even though X writes good
english fairly similar to mine, the small differences may account for
25-40 points. On the other hand Y writes with entirely different english
that I do, and might sit just 50-60 points back of me. For example with a
certain small text of mine as a baseline, another writing by myself got
about 85, one by X got 62, and one by Y got about 45. So even though X
writes much more like I do than like Y does, his score is closer to that
of Y in comparison to me.

Something to note is that there are some really obvious words, like "a",
"the", "I", etc, that everybody will use, and thus common doubles (not so
much triples, but still some), so any two people comparing each other
should get something like a 20 score basically by default. So subtracting
that from the above, it's like I had 65, X had 42, and Y had 23. The small
differences between X and I still lead to such a big variation because of
the non-linear function that makes comparisons: I don't just have more of
the same words, I thus have more of the same doubles and triples. The fact
that X got that close to me (64% of my score), even after subtracting an
arbitrary default value of obvious words, is a testiment to just how
comparable the rest of our basic vocabulary is.

People with english as a second language, even if writing technically
proper english, may rely on specific words a lot and completely avoid
other obvious ones (like 'got' for 'have', or so). So they could match
themselves extremely well and match others very poorly.

So here are some good and accurate excuses if some random guy matches you:

- unmask.py is crap
- Two people with a strong command of english who use a lot of
  conjunctions and common verbs with ease could have a very strong
  correlation.
- People that have a very limited vocabulary will have their top100 lists
  padded by less common words, and will match less in general.
- By knowing and using a mass of small words at the expense of long words,
  you increase your match potential in general.
- Most of the long/odd words used won't make it into the top 100 lists
  that are used for comparison.
- Vocabulary testing is a good idea for people of different nationalities
  and education levels, but for people of the same ones, it's very cheap.
- This is entirely vocabulary, and doesn't even test that, just compares
  the most popular words.

sub Clpwn { ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; my $self = shift; own($self, <<'EOCLPWN'

Well, these kids hit the scene very recently. Whilst we appreciated their
belittling of whitedust/cronus, we do not appreciate some of the shit they
are pumping out, especially regarding the full disclosure mailing lists,
talking shit in IRC and the general way they write their blogs.

Some of the blogs and quotes you can dig up on their site actually made us
question whether the site is a joke. We decided to put those thoughts to
the back of our mind and own them anyway.

These guys talk about XSS like its an OpenSSH remote root. Lets take a
peak at some lol quotes.

##Quote 1##
In the early hours of Monday August 13th, the servers of CNN International
were hit by a devastating cross-domain injection attack by a group of
blackhat hackers identifying only themselves by the mysterious acronym
'CLPWN'.

<ZF0 Translation> 
----> devastating cross-domain injection attack -> XSS
----> blackhat hackers(CLPWN) -> media attention seekers

##Quote 2##
"Experts say that the hacking group, funded by unknown sponsors and with
no official spokesperson or representative in the media, appears to be
highly sophisticated and dedicated to attacking only high profile and
popular web sites."

<ZF0 Translation>
-----> Experts -> wtf? CLPWN writes these blogs themselves :/
-----> highly sophisticated....in the art of ./xss_fuzz

##Quote 3##
"Industry insiders state that Team CLPWN may be a loose coming together of
some of the world's most notorious blackhat hacker groups, and that the
skills and capabilities of such a group are unlikely to have ever been
seen before in the security and hacking worlds."

<ZF0 Translation>
-----> Not needed here really, this is universal in all languages...pure
and simple LOL material.

We are not actually sure if this site is a joke. If it's not then we have
just owned some truly mixed up kids. Attention CLPWN: Blackhats don't post
bugs. Fair play for giving Cronus shit, but you need to be set straight,
stop posting to FD, stop seeking the media and finally stop writing about
yourselves like you owned Bill Gates with one of your el8 XSS's.

I guess its tim'e to drop some of these bitches' dox :)

sub Mil { ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; my $self = shift; own($self, <<'EOMIL'


Allow me to detail to you a story about a boy named Julian, aka Milamber,
aka Mil.

Julian decided to play the hacker game on the internet and make lots of
hacker friends. He just had one problem: Julian lacked talent of his own.
This made him a cheap and often annoying hanger-on. However, the internet
tolerated little Julian, because of his common drunken evenings on IRC,
which, if often annoying, at least gave him the image of a bumbling and
likable drunk.

"No skillz just illz"

Since sometime well before we published our first ezine we have had many
password hashes, and among those we had a hash belonging to Mil. This hash
was formed from the password "lightning". This is an embarrassing and
stupid password and in all ways is rather insufficient. We could choose any
method to find the source of that hash. I just...I just cannot get over
how stupid that password was.

But Mil gets dumber! See, when we published our first ezine, we included
that hash among many others. In fact, it was included thrice. Further, we
made specific reference to Mil and to his father (information meant to
signal that we had read through his emails). I did not consider this very
subtle.

Mil did not change his password. Not only did we have access to his emails
and online accounts, but whoever else cared to also did. We publicly
humiliated Mil, and it went right over his ignorant head.

Here are a few lessons to learn from this episode:

1. When an ezine comes out and shocks the scene, check for your presence
   in it. 

	We have devised an elite command for you to use just for this
	purpose:
	grep -i 'mil[amber| ]' ezine.txt
	To use this please open a terminal (if you don't know how please
	ask on IRC) and type that. But if ezine.txt is not in the current 
	directory that won't work quite right! With a bit of asking on IRC
	I am sure you can figure it out. If you find yourself in an ezine, 
	ask yourself if the released information could in any way decrease 
	your security.

2. Do not use passwords like "lightning".

	Seriously, welcome to the internet. You fucking noob.

3. Stay away from hacker forums.

	These could become the targets of real hackers, and you could be
	collateral damage.

Mil has learned, to some degree, some of these lessons.

At some point Mil must have realised that people were reading his emails
(I would have thought the zine would have made it fucking obvious!) and he
changed his password. Now he uses something really elite, compilations like
"U3wc1g9arARR". Passwords like that must make Mil feel HACKER-PROOF. 

Additionally, Mil deleted some of his most embarrassing emails, which we
cannot bring to you here. My favourite was when he poured his heart out to
some emo bint (was that "suicidalbutterfly" or one of the others?) and
got harshly rejected.

So, as you have probably guessed by now (but this may be a shock to little
Julian!) we hacked him again. So, let's get into our sequel.

Mil doesn't really do anything on the internet. In his
milamber.1@gmail.com account he mostly sent out emails along the lines of
cuntrash.txt (see below). Something else that we can only call
"interesting" can be seen at derision.txt below.

His inbox is flooded with Myspace messages (still...). He is most easily
classified as a Myspace whore. The entire point of his online existence is
to try to pick up girls on Myspace. To see an example of him chatting with
an old skank (*you* didn't have to see her picture. Well, maybe you have.
Who knows who else has owned Mil?), check out yumi.txt. 

However, mostly his messages are to or from a lady named Cassie.
Evidently, while not producing anything to speak of, all Mil has done in
the last year online is try to get with this girl. And for being a girl
that has supposedly had a boyfriend for five years, she sure does flirt
back. I think these two should stop fucking around and start fucking
around, if you get my meaning (because Mil probably won't :-P). 

To see some examples of him chatting with Cassie, read flirt.txt,
honour.txt, and stud.txt. Any of you that know Mil and have watched him not
code, not learn, and not do shit this year, know now that this is what he
has been putting his efforts into. Hundreds of messages with Cassie.

He even gives her a bit of advice about using teh internets and what it
means to try to be hacked! Notice that our simple-minded wanker Julian is
easily satisfied with cheese when people are trying to hack him (see
hack.txt). Let us hope that he eats grilled cheese when reading this, and
maybe he will not mind it so much!

We decided to concurrently release this through Mil's Myspace page,
because we don't think any hackers (reading our zine) take him seriously
anyways. We might as well at least get the message out to the part of
Mil's life that matters to him: Myspace girls. This is actually a little
harsh by our standards (we are nice hackers!) but we still feel ok
considering what other groups might have done in our place. They could
lock him out of all these accounts, deface, spam cruel messages about his
penis size, rm -rf him, heck, who knows what mischief others would do. If
anything, we are too lenient.

See, the reason we are doing this is because Julian called us on. Of all
the people who tried to be our enemies, Mil did so publicly and obviously.
Others were either private or subtle. We don't consider someone an enemy
just because they become jokes in our zine. Most of them were jokes to
begin with. A lot of it is in good fun. Isn't that outrageous? Of all
people, some idiot who has been oblivious to our access to multiple
accounts for over a year is the one telling us that our time is up! Mil
told us that "redemption is coming". Well Mil, that has been a
self-fulfilling prophecy, except it is not happening the way you thought.

By the way, Mil never said that HE would even attempt to attack us. It
would be his big hacker buddies that would do so. See how this has turned
out so far, Julian? No matter how elite your hacker buddies may be, they
will not stop you from being a moron and getting yourself owned.

Instead, Mil has new lessons to learn. He has finally mastered "do not use
'lightning' as a password", we think, but we feel that we can teach him 
more advanced lessons like "do not reuse passwords" and "be careful who 
you accept links from, especially when you are slow on the updating front".

Mil, stay away from hackers. If you could have done so without _doing_
anything or saying anything, you would have been OK. But you just cannot
stop from tempting us (and probably others who are a bit more silent) from
owning you. Just, stay away. Stop pretending to be anything more talented
than a mediocre end user. 

Julian, it is our diagnosis that you are insecure. Do not be dismayed;
together we can have a brainstorming session and potentially reach closure
on some of your issues. Let's talk about your feelings. Then we can
reassess our options bilaterally. But really, until you stop being such a
fucking tool, just don't bring yourself to our attention.

plump pillows are scattered all over the wooden floor-boards, and the

but I'd say she can ... Except for what she did on the weekend, but that's
sort of different!! 

haha no i don't want to be alone forever ... but I'm still young, and
being single is rather enjoyable..Also breaking up relationships gets
annoying, hence the reason I was thinking I should just stop talking to
her

so you picked her up even tho she had a BF? are yous close friends? or do
you just kind of know her but there is a huge attraction? well dont take
this the wrong way but if she is cheating on her BF with you then she
either A cant be trusted or B is really into you so you should go for it!
Dont like to get in relationships? why? what do you want to be alone for

I probably would have gone for it ... feelings suck :P

"Times change and technology progresses. Attackers adept and attacks evolve.
At this point in history, we can wax fondly for the halcyon days when computers
were hacked for pride or ego -- the good ole' simpler times when underground
hacker wars were electronically waged and the collateral damage was the main
website of The New York Times. Or the Solaris machines that were owned and the 
high profile computer security icons that had their e-mail spools stolen and 
personal poetry publicly posted. Or the OpenBSD machines that were rumored
to be silently owned and the early copies of the most lauded online underground
hacker journal that were distributed months ahead of time. Good times. Nowadays,
there is no underground hacker scene -- not like there used to be (bring back 
BoW and Hagis!)." -- Mike Schiffman from the introduction to _Hacker's_Challenge_3_

While route is indeed a whitehat sellout (and appears to like watching his
co-workers be publicly humiliated), he is certainly correct about one thing:
The Scene is IDLE. Not just a little idle, we're talking over a year of idleness
here. Sure, occasionally groups attempt to make a stir. Undoubtedly, some of
the readers will remember the PHC Delka Strike Force, hosted at http://el8.ru/x/
 (now down). Or the release of the epic h0no3 about one year ago. And of course,
our own fun little contributions. However, despite the hard work of a number of 
individuals, many of the goals originally set forth for pr0j3kt m4yh3m by el8 and 
the Phrack High Council have yet to be accomplished. This needs to change. 
Instead of chatting on IRC all day, go out and own a whitehat. Do a PHC mission. 
Contribute to pr0j3kt m4yh3m. 

The recent events revolving around the blogger known as "InfoSec Sellout" 
bring an interesting point to light. When the older "security professionals" 
discovered the "fact" that InfoSec Sellout was LMH and was backed by PHC, it
caused quite a stir for those that remembered the heyday of the pr0j3kt. For 
the whitehats that had just entered the industry post-whitehat holocaust, it 
didn't mean a thing. They simply assumed (like 90% of the HTS userbase) that 
PHC was/is a group of dissatisfied script kiddies. Too bad all the evidence
points to the contrary. Another sad fact is that whitehats have not only
taken over the public side of the scene, but the private side as well. These
"revelations" about InfoSec Sellout at one time would have come from an
anonymous post to FD, from a member of the underground. Now they come from a
"respected security professional". Instead of talking about the activities of
real hackers, the gossip reels these days deal with the exploits of whitehats
like David Maynor, HD Moore and others. Is this what we've allowed the scene to
become? A bunch of idlers thinking about fat middle aged whitehats? Where's the 
rage? Where's the dedication to the eradication of the greedy security 
consultants? Where's all the activity that was prevalent in the scene until 
recently?

A time has come for a change. Follow the example dikline set out. Take back the
scene! Go out and actually hack. Don't post exploits to FD; post a whitehat's
spools! Continue the legacy of the glorious pr0j3kt m4yh3m!

Never sell out, never surrender.

John Bambenek is the Assistant Politics Editor for BC Magazine and is an 
academic professional for the University of Illinois. By trade, he is an 
information security professional, part of the Internet Storm Center and a 
courseware author and certification grader for the GIAC family of security 
certifications. He is a syndicated columnist who blogs at Part-Time Pundit 
and the executive director of The Tumaini Foundation which helps AIDS 
orphans and other children in Tanzania to get an education.
John Bambenek is a man of many trades: An assistant politics editor; an 
academic "professional" for the university of Illinois; an information 
security "specialist"; author and grader of the GIAC security certs. He 
also loves to blog bullshit.

Despite his background charity work, the internet does not make exceptions 
- speaking out of turn will get you owned.

Bambenek loves blogging so much he has four, yes four, blogs ( 
www.bloggernews.net, www.mensdailynews.com, thewideawakes.org and his site 
www.parttimepundit.com ). 

Now you may be wondering what it is Bambenek has done wrong. Well, despite 
being a self-loving whitehat(burn) and talking more shit than a cess pit 
with a mouth, it wasn't either of these reasons that forced us into 
action.

This guy actually insulted us personally. I assume all of you have read 
P64 and probably enjoyed it (if you saw past the typos, but I won't 
mention that here). If you're reading this, John, it should be coming 
clear now shouldn't it?

I'd like to point you all to 
http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/06/05/183157.php

This is Bambenek's review of P64 - I think he probably believes he has 
some authority to speak about the "underground" because of his security 
certifications and time at ISS. Well John, you are either the dumb piece 
of shit we think you are, or you like being rm'd and having your emails 
read. Lets take a peak at the review.

##Quote 1##
"As an information security professional, lately I've become quite bored. 
The state of hacking today seems to be almost solely employed by the 
spammer-class of miscreants looking to make as much money as quickly as 
possible. It's big business now. As such, they continue to exploit the 
same weaknesses, again and again, and simply lack the spirit and ingenuity 
of previous generations of hackers."

## I bet the first five words of most of your security related blogs begin 
that way don't they? Same old whitehat drivel. I can also assure you John, 
we aren't all trying to sell our exploits on wslabi, and to be honest John, 
you spam more shit than anyone. Four blogs? All mirroring the same 
bullshit?

##Quote 2##
"Hacking has been commoditized. With spammers running the show whose 
bottom-line is money, information security threats have become 
quantifiable, systemitizable, and predictable. Occasionally there are some 
really neat new security hacks, the WMF exploit and the ANI exploit come 
to mind, but by and large, it's the same old stupid tricks done and 
redone. This is because they continue to exploit the weakest link, the 
unsophisticated PC user who will still fall prey to 419 scams after all 
these years. Upwards of 80% of people will click on phishing e-mails if 
the message looks "good" enough, such as through a social networking site. 
Any idiot can own hardware now�.� and they do. It's quantity over 
quality."

## Generalising. Did you predict this attack? As a side note, you have 
only discovered one public bug (harvesting bugs for wslabi?), you lack 
skill John. I don't even know how you can consider yourself a security 
professional.

##Quote 3##
"At the same time, many of the old school hacker groups have sold out. 
Instead of continuing to work on their craft, they've gone to work for the 
highest bidder. As a result, the old hacking vitality has been lost."

## Yes, all our exploits belong to wslabi. You know nothing about hacking 
dude (quit monitoring SANS stats, might get you somewhere), this article 
will totally discredit you in the security industry and deservedly so. We 
respect your right to blog, but this next quote really took it too far, 
especially in terms of lolz.

##Quote 4##
"I wouldn't be doing the job I do if it weren't for hacking; the problem 
is that you're boring the hell out of me."

## Wait, we're boring you? Dude even with your mail spools combined, you 
are much...much more boring than anyone or anything, and that includes FD 
mailing list.

##Quote 5##
"I have some sympathy for their underground and anti-authority tendencies, 
though I've not participated in the underground."

## Lies. Bambenek == Maynor == LMH == Infosec sellout. Fuck your sympathy 
dude, good luck with your perfect life, I should throw Tyler Durden quotes 
at you. 30 years old and never had a woman :/

##Quote 6##
�The reason there is often a delay is that a lot of the people who 
actually install a lot of these keylogger programs are not that 
sophisticated, Bambenek said. In most cases, they're teenage 
hackers who flip the information to more organized criminal groups for 
some quick cash.�

## Yeah man, fuck those keyloggers!?! 0day can happen to anyone...but more 
likely the retarded (Copyright Raven 2007)

##Quote 7##
"I was in a Washington Post article today in which I basically was quoted 
calling all the online credit card thiefs n00bs. I�..m starting a pool, 
how long til they DoS me�.�"

## Typical whitehat response, we are probably script kiddies because we 
owned you. The truth is dude, you are the n00b here (see below for 
password l0lz). And as for DoS? meh, no one visits your site.

Anyway, I guess its time to drop some d0x :D

Other than that, not really anything worth noting, other than his shitty 
self promoting news letters (Bambenek for president). John, any further 
comment and you will be owned again.

Name:
   John Bambenek

Mailing address:
   715 Erin Dr

Phone number:
   217-493-0760

And on a final note, I'd like to finish this article on a note that will 
make everyone laugh (at John Bambenek). As a security consultant, you 
really would think he'd know better. A seven letter password, a word found 
in dictionaries, all lowercase, you find it on the beach? Similar to a 
stone? Well if you can guess it you you too can own John Bambenek. wtf 
kind of password is "pebbles"? If anyone employs you again to work in the 
security industry they are cleary more stupid than you are. One other 
thing, you are right, you wouldn't be in this job if it wasn't for hacking 
- so quit fucking leeching from what we create or you will be owned again 
and again.

Just another disgruntled teenager trying to be nostalgic for a long passed 
era which I never even participated in. This relevant enough for you?
	cya John.

sub CF0 { ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; my $self = shift; say($self, <<'EOCF0'


== Call For 0wning ==

Same deal as before. Own whoever you can and report it to us for elite
prizes! Or just respect.

== Results ==

I think it is fair to say that our first CF0 was a complete and utter
rags-to-riches success story. Despite drawbacks (hakspace getting defaced
and removed, every other site being redone) we still 0wned everything to
do with psg. Our one sadness is that not one external group responded to
our call, unless one of the many people owning psg was inspired by us and
simply declined to contact us. We expect more this time.

"In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the 
silence of our friends." 
- Martin Luther King Jr.

== New Target: The Cult of the Dead Cow ==

The cDc are a group of media-focused attention-grabbing fucktards.

These guys produce shitty content and then market it as if it means
something.

Sound familiar? Most definitely. They're awfully like psg, our last
victim. In fact, they are so much like psg that they invited psg to be a
member of their "Ninja Strike Force" wanksquad.

The variety of cDc websites and content is simply designed to confuse you
into thinking that they do something.

In reality, all the cDc does is try to convince the world that they are a
very important, top-of-the-world, hacking group.

Let's start at the top. The cDc leader, Ratte', is a piece of noob. Yes,
he has known how to type for decades. But what has he learned in that time
huddling over his keyboard? Fuck all. Check out his Phrack profile. He
was 14 when he started cDc. For years it was just a group that published
dreadful and creative (read: non-technical) text files. Now they do that,
plus audio and image files. 

You know how cDc tries to sell the image that it has been the shit in the
hacker community since 1984? Yes, well, that's complete bullshit. And
Ratte' knows it:

"But what makes CULT OF THE DEAD COW different and has enabled us to last
is that cDc has never been about technology" <- so stop calling
yourselves hackers to gain hits, fuckers.

From 1984 until something like 1998 they did hardly anything except write
these shitty articles, recruit new members, and suck some media cock.

This is the one exception: in the early 1990s they ran hohocon. hohocon
had very limited amounts of technical content, and it wasn't supplied by
cDc. Think of it as a bunch of fat losers getting together to bumfuck each
other.

What you need to understand is that Ratte' is basically an emo loser who
blogged for twenty years. 

Over time he has recruited other media cock suckers, most of which have
only lasted a few years. Fools that they are, their most popular work will
forever be what they released with cDc, and it will be considered made by
cDc, with them mentioned only as an afterthought. Not coincidentally, the
reason their shitty work was popular to begin with was because it was
released by cDc.

"I think with our longevity we've worked towards finding a new way to
relate to technology and the emerging global structure." <- you mean
you have worked towards recruiting new members who at least know how to 
use some new technology.

What is the one bona-fide highlight of cDc's technical career? It was when
they wrote Back Orifice and Back Orifice 2000 and spoke at two Defcons
about them. Congratulations, you wrote a shitty backdoor for Windows 95/98
(not like 98 was a big technical advancement over 95) years after win95
had been released. According to ISS, they used a two byte encryption key
(http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/advise5) with a known plaintext.
Seriously, why not just rot13 it? Stupid wankers. Apparently cDc losers
continue to implement encryption poorly.

Yet BO was quite popular. All because cDc talked it up. Real hackers were
writing much better backdoors, trivially, and keeping them to themselves.
Real hackers actually had backdoors that weren't designed for grandma's
PC. And Defcon supported cDc in their bullshit game. BO was cDc's way of
saying "look ma, we got a couple new members who know this programming
thing. we're still relevant!" The other programs by cDc since then have
been just as shitty. Bollocks I say.

cDc has never, ever, produced anything good.

The combined technical production of all cDc members, ever, during their
time at cDc, is easily comparable to a year's worth of work by a small
"script kiddie" group, despite all the time that kiddie group would have
invested actually hacking.

cDc also has this hacktivismo thing, which is also a piece of shit that
hasn't accomplished anything. But it sure has produced a lot of rhetoric,
adding more shit to the fan, and has a few members whose names can be
added to the cDc shitlist.

They have a "ninja strike force", which is just another bullshit name for
cDc members. See, cDc wants to throw a bunch of names at you, like cDc,
cDc communications, ninja strike force, and hacktivismo, to make it look
like they are involved in a lot of stuff. 

Now of all things they have integrated psg. They get to use him as a wank
vehicle to spread their name. He does likewise. It's a gay publicity fest.
psg gets to talk about Eve (lame Whitedust program) on the NSF blog,
despite the fact that he didn't write it. Literally using cDc to sell a
product that nobody in cDc made.

These guys spend their days forming myspace blog posts. It is a bloody
group of myspace users who tell the world that they are one of the oldest
hacking groups, and use the number 1984 as their evidence.

Please start owning cDc assets or individuals. We want cDc to just end.
They are worse than 2600 (and we would probably write a CF0 on 2600 if we
hadn't owned them so much already).

== Targets ==

Some domains to own:

cultdeadcow.com
hacktivismo.com
ninjastrikeforce.com
bo2k.com
http://www.cultdeadcow.com/?p=proj # Good list to work on!
http://www.cultdeadcow.com/?p=other # Another list to work on!

Here is an incomplete list of people to own (gathered from cDc websites
for your convenience):

(here be older members)
Grandmaster Ratte'

THE NIGHTSTALKER - gis.net/~cht
Count Zero - zero.hastypasty.net

Chamuco

(here be others)
anyone on IRC
anyone on their forums

I excluded a few older members. I get the feeling that they knew how lame
it was, and have moved on. Ratte' just finds it convenient to use their
names to try to support his credibility. But we don't really know them, so
do what you would like.

There are lots of reasons to own any of these individuals. Many are
morons. Many have never accomplished anything. The few who have written
code for cDc have done so poorly. Some are whitehat scenewhores. If you
can't decide, how about we offer suggestions:

Ratte' - Start at the top and own this noob. He knows what he is, but he
         won't stop lying.
Mixter - The current "Look, we have a real hacker!" member. See his
         Wikipedia entry!
Comrade Smack - The current "I'm fresh and exciting!" member.
psg - why not?

== Motivation Time ==

I hear a lot of rhetoric about taking back the scene. Taking it back from
no-talent whitehats. And I'm all for that - we even did some of that in
this zine. But come on, nobody is claiming such a big piece of the hacker
history cake as cDc is. You want to take back the scene? Well, do it. Wipe
these fuckers off the internet. It's easy and it can be seen by far more
people than someone reading a zine or someone who notices a whitehat blog
disappear.

There are more than enough targets to go around. So pick one and fucking 
0wn it.

Here is a motivational quote from some friends of ours:

	Blend in. Get trusted.
     Trust nobody. Own everybody.
Disclose nothing. Destroy everything.
	 Take back the scene.

sub Hellboundhackers { ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; my $self = shift; own($self, <<'EOHELLBOUNDHACKERS'


There comes a time for every civilization to come to an end. That end could be
a series of violent conflicts that come in waves, or a slow sputtering out 
of interest until it's effectively dead. Occasionally, a community that's slow
to realize that it's out-modded, out-dated, out-gunned and out-classed has to 
be helped along to its eventual demise. 

Such was the case for HellBoundHackers (HBH). HBH is your typical lamer site. 
They have a forum with over 20,000 registered users, lots of stupid articles
that are pointless and don't convey any new information. They also have your
typical administrators that think themselves to be elite hackers. In this case,
despite the name, they're staunchly whitehat advocating "ethical" hacking. 
However, MrCheese and his posse also regard themselves as hacktivists and the
self proclaimed saviours of the Internet. They hack websites whose content they
disagree with and post a defacement. Hmm... does anyone else see the 
contradiction here? 

They also advocate practices such as full-disclosure, and yet they claim to
hate script kiddies. All their "hacking" articles always talk about how you 
should code your own exploits. Too bad none of their members has a clue about
how to do that. 

The members over on HBH also have the typical narrow whitehat perspective. 
Anyone who actually hacks is a script kiddie, regardless of their actual skill
level. This should come as a shock to them... 

So, in accordance with the rules of pr0j3kt m4yh3m, it has been decided that 
HBH needs to die. This comes for all communities; it is inevitable. You can
try to fight it but you will lose. After all, you don't know us, you only know
of us.

And as Raster so bravley said:

08:22 <~ShiroTenryu> I dare you all, hack my network, so you can prove a point!

We'll take that dare Raster. Now, let's take a look at their IRC network:

Yup, they can sure admin a network... good one guys. Made for a good
afternoon hax, right along with our after school snax. Really, you talk about
being great admins (we're looking at you here Gumbie) and you all reused 
passwords? Do you see the contradiction there? And you also didn't notice when
we had sniffers running on your network for months. Again, you all claim to be
secure, and yet again this was not noticed. Nice oversight RASNet staff, it
made for more fun for us.

We have several hundred megs of sniffed IRC logs, but we don't want to bore
you. HBH, your time is up. Accept this gracefully, and try to save whatever
small public image you have left.

But first take a look at this. It's hilarious. It's so bad it could easily be a
prank.

Might as well copy the text verbatim.


########################################

To:  The FBI and SS 

Mr_Cheese, the loved admin of HellBoundHackers.org, is being arrested, for
simply doing what he believed in, and being a 'True Hacker', sharing his
knowledge with anyone who wanted to learn, and trying to do his part to
make a difference in the world. 

Myself, along with many other loyal members of this website, are outraged.



QUOTE FROM HELLBOUNDHACKERS.ORG: 
Mr_Cheese wrote: 
this is the hardest message i have ever had to write, and could most
likely be my last ever post on HBH. im writing this message whilst
struggeling to retain my tears. I have been dreading this day for my whole
career. 

i love this site. i love what it has become. i love the members on it. 

Recent events have now caused me to give up "hacking", and soon give up
HBH. 

As some of you know im having problems with the Secret Service. 

They have been investigating me for months now and even some members on
HBH have been interevied by FBI agents. 

Someone i considered my friend, and thought i could trust has actually
been working for the SS and been sending them every piece of information
he had on me. He even hosted HBH for a while just so the he could relay
information to the SS. Thank you danserv.co.uk betrayel is something i
never forget. 

Secret Service also bugged/monitored the HBHCon and even arrested a member
at the end of the day to get extra info. This member had his laptop
coppied and room raided so they could gain extra info on me and HBH. 

My AIM / MSN conversations are being monitored and recorded, my internet
activites are being watched. 

I am almost certain HBH is only on this current server because the SS are
still investigating and allowing it to be up to gain further information
on me. 

This isnt even 1/2 of everything that is going on right now. 

It is only a matter of very short time before i get arrested, and as soon
as they have me in custody, there wont be a need for them to keep HBH
online, so it will be taken down by Secret Service. 

The True Hacker is a dying breed, and im sadened to say there is no room
left in this world for them. I mean no joke when i say my skills have
enabled me to literally save lifes all over the world. Now, my skills
mixed with my intense ethical stance on everything i do, has become a
threat to the gouvernment. 

I've seen people deface and hack hundreds of sites for no ethical reason
for the sole purpose of destroying it and attempting to become famous.
Arent these people the real threat? These people have never done a ethical
thing in their career, have never saved or even improved a single life via
their skills, yet they dont get punished? 

i cant desribe how im feeling right now. im just a kid and chances are im
going to jail. 

i love you all and will always remember you and everything everyone has
ever done for HBH. i wish everyone the very very best with whatever they
choose to do with their lifes. i only hope you can follow my example and
make me proud. 

im so very very sorry. 


________________ 


I know that the media has portrayed the image of a hacker to be malicious,
dangerous, and unethical, however, this isn't the case with many of us,
especially Mr_Cheese. As you can see from his above quote, and many other
forum posts, he is very ethical, and is a 'True Hacker', one of a dying
breed. 

The site, HellBound Hackers, is also probably going to be taken down.
We've had a bit of trouble in the past, with people questioning the
legality of our content, but let me - and this
(http://www.hellboundhackers.org/isthislegal.php) page assure you - we are
a completly legal site. We break no rules. We teach, we educate. We hope,
that someday, there will be fairness in the world, and hackers will be not
judged by the few that do wrong, but by the many who do right. 


Please, stop to think about this. Is this really fair? Should the FBI be
arresting this teenager, simply because he has been steriotyped as bad? I
don't think that's fair, and I'm sure that you'll agree too. 


Quoting a magnificant piece of text by a personal hero of mine - The
Hacker Manifesto by The Mentor - '...Yes, I am a criminal. My frime is
that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and
think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you,
something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is
my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all...
after all, we're all alike. (from
http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/manifesto.html) 

I know I can't do much about this, but quoting a fellow member on HBH -
'I'd rather die standing then live on my knees' - and that's what I'm
fighting for. This is what I, and many other members, think is right, and
we're fighting for it. How can the government want to arrest and bring
down Mr_Cheese, when he's helping the internet far more than he is hurting
it. 

I know that you're probably reading this, and thinking 'oh yeah, some
random hacker kids. They don't matter, they're hackers, they just want my
credit card number' or something. Well, I'd like to stop you there, and
correct you. I may be a 'hacker', but I am certainly not what the media
portrays me to be. I am not 'evil'. I do not hack and steal things. I do
not deface sites just for the fun of it. I do not unleash viruses on the
wild. I do not spend my spare time excecuting scripts on government
websites. Instead, I fight for things that I believe in, like this. 

So, fellow members of HellBound Hackers, any other hackers, computer
enthusiasts, programmers, security experts, and anyone else at all who
believes this is unfair: please sign this, in the hope that, although we
are just a minority, our words can be heard by the officials, and fairness
can come into place. 



And lastly, LONG LIVE HBH! 

<3 
sarah_briarmoss, on behalf of all members of HBH. 

Sincerely, 

The Undersigned 


########################################

I can't wait to see them try to use this defence when Mr_Cheese is being
prosecuted for defacing some webpage or something else as simple and
illegal.

<+Prosecutor> Mr_Cheese, so you actually admit to defacing the website in
question and writing "Mr_Cheese owns j00!!", despite your not guilty plea?
<+Mr_Cheese> YOU CAN'T JAIL ME, LONG LIVE TRUE HACKERS LONG LIVE FREEDOM

These HBH morons don't have a clue about why Mr_Cheese is being
investigated, so they assume it is just to crush powerful
anti-establishment hackers.

"The True Hacker is a dying breed, and im sadened to say there is no room
left in this world for them. I mean no joke when i say my skills have
enabled me to literally save lifes all over the world. Now, my skills
mixed with my intense ethical stance on everything i do, has become a
threat to the gouvernment."

Who decided this wanker could call himself a "True Hacker"? Where did he
save lives? How is he a threat to the government?

<@Cheney> Mr. President, the world's last True Hacker, holding out against
our anti-True Hacker campaign, has halted our path of destruction. He is
saving children in Burma, Palestine, and Nigeria. 
<@Bush> His elite hacking skills have made him a threat to this very
establishment which I rule over. He must be stopped.
<@Cheney> Yes sir. Libby, bring me Captain Beria from the Secret Service.
We have an assignment for him. 

"I've seen people deface and hack hundreds of sites for no ethical reason
for the sole purpose of destroying it and attempting to become famous.
Arent these people the real threat? These people have never done a ethical
thing in their career, have never saved or even improved a single life via
their skills, yet they dont get punished?"

Have to start somewhere. Particularly with a moron who assumes his ethics
stand true and that they thus justify his actions.

"We've had a bit of trouble in the past, with people questioning the
legality of our content, but let me - and this
(http://www.hellboundhackers.org/isthislegal.php) page assure you - we are
a completly legal site."

< Lawyer> stfu noob
< Lawyer> Whether or not the content the site hosts is illegal or not,
Mr_Cheese will be charged with anything that HE has done to break the law.
< Lawyer> The courts decide if he has broken the law, not you. 
< FBI> I'll take your gay wanker headquarters offline if I want to, I'm
hosting it out of the goodness of my heart. I was there when Mr_Cheese
needed me.

"Please, stop to think about this. Is this really fair? Should the FBI be
arresting this teenager, simply because he has been steriotyped as bad? I
don't think that's fair, and I'm sure that you'll agree too."

< FBI> Mr. President, we have found a True Hacker.
<@Bush> Popular culture has taught me that hackers undermine our country
with their anti-establishment tendencies and mirror sunglasses. Destroy him.

"Quoting a magnificant piece of text by a personal hero of mine - The
Hacker Manifesto by The Mentor [...]" (Way to misquote, bitch)

< Mr_Cheese> MY CRIME IS THAT OF LEARNING. LEARNING HOW TO HACK BY
DEFACING PEOPLE I DON'T AGREE WITH

Let's make fun of some of the morons signing this online petition, shall
we?

363.	Preston Lynch	He never did anything wrong 
< FBI> Our research disagrees.

355.	jason	knowlegde is power, if they won'tlet us learn we will
struggle to survive until we are bring about self destruction.
< FBI> TERRORIST

343.	Darren	HBH forever, if you attack one of us, all of us will
attack you!!!
< FBI> We await your onslaught.

332.	Chris	Mr_Cheese is everything I aspire to be.
< FBI> LOL LOSER

308.	Dominic It is not wise to arrest someone who is known so well. It
happened with Mandella and Mr.Cheese will be no different be careful you
might unleash the fury of a community of hackers.
< FBI> Mr_Cheese will bring the end of our era of hacker apartheid.

282.	xplicit-pki-raja@hotmail.com	free mr_cheseeeee u fukin
americans have no rites to invade policy so fuk u bush fuk u fbi fuk u SS
fuk every one who h8tz MUslimz FUk u alllllllllllllllllllll
< FBI> TERRORIST

256.	Mike	"Hi, nice site, visit my web site too!

226.	Steve	Why Break Something When It Scares You

217.	syklops This is Kevin Mitnick all over again.

173.	Simon Morris	He is a GOD. He is a good man. I will stand by him
forever
< FBI> We think you bend over for him too.

156.	47th_snake	Why do the good people always get the blame?

44.	Charles HBH is my life.

So there you go, HBH is full of morons. The site needs to die and 
anybody with a future will go somewhere else.

Guess what? The word on the street is that the entire post by Mr_Cheese
was a prank to get attention. If so, that adds an entire dimension of
"lawl" to everything.

The ZF03 staff can be contacted at superheroes(a)hushmail.com. Don't
bother sending to that other address; it expired. :-D

That's it for our entertainment today. We hope you enjoyed every bit of
it. As for us, we are happy to get that out and relax. We'll be chillin'
at the ZF0 mansion in Miami, hosting parties with Shaq. It's good to be on
top. We're not the only group up there; we are just doing our small part
in the losing battle to keep streets safe and alleys clear. The others
know who they are. Be sure to check out anything else interesting that
comes out.

In all seriousness we will take some time off. Then we will be keeping to
ourselves while auditing code and writing tools. We're taking it easy and
we do not want shit from anyone. You got owned, move on, we don't need the
sob story. Try to learn from the experience. This means that we will be
giving another massive headstart on the CF0.

Keep it real and keep hacking.
