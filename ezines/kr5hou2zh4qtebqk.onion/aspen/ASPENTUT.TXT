Intro:
	Well you may be thinking that, Oh! yes I've read tutorials
	before and they are about as helpful as a dead parrot.....
	I thought it was about time to write a little series of
	textfiles on how to use (and abuse) Mailbox systems.
	This series will NOT just cover Hacking and scanning of mail
	systems but also the facilities used on each................

Start:
	O.K. After recently coming across an ASPEN system which I
	successfully managed to hack a couple of mailboxes for my
	personal use, I didn't realise all the many facilities 
	available to the (Ab)user. I have collated the following
	information myself I hope it will be of some help to U.

	Assuming that you already have a mailbox on the system:
	
	When Entering your mailbox number and passcode the system
	will tell you if you have any new (or saved) messages.
	Let's assume you have ONE new message.

	You may select the following options:

	Push:
	-----	1 - Recieve Messages
		2 - Send a message
		3 - Check Reciept
		4 - Personal Options

Option chosen:
--------------

1:
""	Whilst message is playing you have a sub-menu of options.

	 1: Rewind Message Ten Seconds
	11: Rewind To Start Of Message
	 2: Pause Message (Press Again To Unpause)
	 3: Fast Forward Message Ten seconds
	33: Fast Forward To End Of Message
	 
	 4: Decrease Playing Speed (Slow Down)
	 6: Increase Playing Speed (Speed Up)

	 8: Decrease Volume
	 9: Increase Volume

	After listening to the message you may select one of these.

	 4: Replay Message
	 5: Envelope Message (Find Source Mailbox+Time+Date+Length)
	 6: Send On Message To Another Subscriber - Record Intro Msg.
	 7: ERASE Message
	 8: Reply To Message
	 9: Save Message In Archives (For Later Listening)

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

2:
""	Send a Message will ask you to speak whilst it records you.

	Press # to stop recording then enter Destination Mailbox.

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

3:
""	Check reciept of messages sent.

	This will allowyou to check if a message has been read and
	also if a message has been saved. 
	There are other uses for this function (See L8ter)

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

4:
""	Personal Options. Good fun can be had by all !!

	1: Change Your Passwords
        ------------------------

	This Section Refers To Guest Box Control.
	If you are Strapped for boxes then you can assign
	Guest Boxes so you can send messages to each other even
	if One person doesn't have a mailbox.

	    1: Change Guest 1's Password

		Guest Can Leave AND Recieve Messages	    

	    2: Change Guest 2's Password

		Guest Can Leave AND Recieve Messages

	    3: Change Home Password

		Guest Can Leave AND Recieve Messages

	    4: Change Secretary Password

		Recieve Messages

	    5: Change Mailbox Password (MAIN)

                        ~~~~
	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

	2: Change Your Greetings
        ------------------------

		1: Change Your Name

		 This is the name which people hear when 
		 sending you messages from other boxes.
		 i.e. "Your message will be sent to xxxxxx"

		2: Change Your Greeting

		 This is what Non-Subscribers who are leaving 
		 you mail will hear.

		3: Change Your Extended Abscence Greeting

		 This is the same as the ordinary greeting but
		 people leaving messages will be alerted that
		 you may not be back for some time.

	*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

	3: Distribution Lists
        ---------------------

	Distribution lists are so you can record a message and have
	it automatically sent to all users on your list.

	i.e. Your list could contain EVERYONE'S number
	     Or All Your M8s On the system.

		1: Create Distribution Lists

		2: Edit Distribution Lists

		3: Delete Distribution Lists

		4: Find Names Of People On Lists

	Scanning:
	~~~~~~~~~

	Once you have found a NEW Mailbox, or even a used one.

          .-------------------------, 
	 / DON'T CHANGE JACK SHIT  /
	`-------------------------'

	Press '3' from the main menu.
	This Checks for Reciept of messages (See Previous)

	Enter Mailbox Number: xxxx

	When entered number the system will say one of the following:

	1: The Mailbox Users Name
	2: "xxxx Is not a Valid Number"
	3: "xxxx"

	Start at 0000 then move up to 9999 making a note as follows:

	If you get :

	1. Ignore and enter the next number.
	2. Ignore and enter the next number.
	3. Jump up and down and go WHOOOOPPPEEEEE , you may be in luck.

	When You Have finished you should have a list of POSSIBLE 
	Hackable Mailboxes.
	______
       /      \
      / THEN: / 
      \      /
       `----'

	1. Hang Up And call back the system.
	2. Press '#'
	3. Enter One of Numbers on the list.
	4. If it says 'Enter Password' You can either try and hack it
	   but isn't gonna be a VIRGIN mailbox.
	5. If it says 'This is a voice messaging bollox.... blahh blahh.'
	   then it will come to a point where it says,
	   'Please enter the temporary password assigned by your System
	    Manager'.
	6. Enter Default Passwords.
	   Defaults Are most likely to be the same for all the other VIRGIN
	   voice mail boxes if not, try the other ones.
	7. If It hangs up then GOTO 1.
	8. If it allows you access then play with the options (See Previous)
