    I was sitting on irc, fufilling my daily quota stating that I
have to spend at least 16 Hours a day on irc.  So MeGaEl1T3 comes
on.  It was very late, and I was having problems falling asleep. So
I asked him to read me a story.  Accidently my Log File was on.  I
found it a couple of days later and realized I had to publish this
rebel yell.  I edited out the log, and only kept Mega's messages.




<MeGaEl1T3>                             PHAGZ IN DA 90S G
<MeGaEl1T3>                        I WANT Z()ME FUQING WAREZ D()()D
<MeGaEl1T3> .
<MeGaEl1T3> .
<MeGaEl1T3> Once upon a time there was a fUQiNg little dork kid
<MeGaEl1T3> for his fuckin birthday.  He fuckin god a code from
            his little shit friend
<MeGaEl1T3> next door who wacks off to gifs scanned by rustie
            and edies.
<MeGaEl1T3> the little faggot started couring for groups named
            SWaT and other dumb
<MeGaEl1T3> ancryonyms that r really lame.
<MeGaEl1T3> And he got respect in the pyrate world.
<MeGaEl1T3> Until someone told him that he could dial 0700456XXXX
            for FREE!!
<MeGaEl1T3> And his mom spanked him too hard.
<MeGaEl1T3> And he had to sell his modem.
<MeGaEl1T3> And he killed himself because he couldn't get the 0
            day ware to LAMEWORLD
<MeGaEl1T3>                          THE FUCKIN END

Note:  Issues 3-9 of AWA are taken mostly from other textfile creators such
as PUD.  Instead of pointing out credit every time it is deserved, we will
simply tell you now that most of the material in issues 3-9 is not ours.
We thought it was pretty funny, so we bring it to you anyway. - OP

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION

SPA ALERT! SPA ALERT!

WHOOOP!  WHOOOOP! WHOOOOP!!!!

This is a little text file warning to all Connecticut BBS's.  The SPA is
lurking in CT.  Now the story!

According to our information here at SeCT WHQ we have information for all
the users out there about some recent activity in the area.  Kevin Brook,
Yes the fool that writes the Connecticut BBS list, has called the SPA on
Sin City in Danbury.  This board was a killer board run by the Plaque.  At
this time we have no more information on why this was done, but we will be
conducting an interview with each of the people involved, to get the truth.

At this point we at SeCT think Kevin Brook is an asshole and should be
destroyed.  Also according to other information he had two other people
who helped him do this their names are Lou Rinaldi and Jason Lawson.  As I
said before when we conduct the interviews we will have more information
for you.

For now our suggestion to all bbs's to delete these people if they are on
your board and tighten security.  Never know what board he will turn in next.

So to Kevin Brook and his friends we at SeCT think you are a fuck'in asshole.

P.S.- Kevin if you are reading this and feel we are in the wrong we will be
      conducting an interview with you to get your sidfe of the story.

This has been a SeCT News Warning 03-22-93

The CyberFarce Movement Explained

  This article goes out to all of those self-proclaimed CyberPunks
that you see on BBS', on TV, at the grocery store, and in your
computer science class <asking how to run a program>.  This article is
for those you see holding "Will Neuromance for Food" signs, and for
all of those bullshit broadcasting networks that think they keep up
with the techno times <That's YOU, ~MTV~.  That's YOU, Billy Idol.>.

     This is The CyberPunk:
  The CyberPunk works at some low-paying part-time loser job, making
just enough cash to pay for his InterNet account and tickets to "The
Crying Game."  The CyberPunk can be seen clearing tables at "Denny's",
and waiting for comic book shipments at the local bookshop.
  The CyberPunk thinks he has some literary knowledge.  The CyberPunk
tries to act and seem more intelligent than he really is.  The
CyberPunk likes to gather enough information on many subjects to make
it look as if he knows it all.  The CyberPunk likes to make you think
that he is experienced with mind-altering stimuli and maybe even
explosives.
  The CyberPunk is a reject of the human race who tries to make up for
this mishap by theorizing the advent of armageddon.  The CyberPunk
doesn't care to know anything.  The CyberPunk just wants you to think
he is really sophisticated.
  The CyberPunk knows nothing about computers.  The CyberPunk knows
nothing about computer telecommunications.  The CyberPunk knows
nothing about modern culture, and definately does not know how to
distinguish culture from fad.

   These are The CyberPunk Believers:
  The CyberPunk Believers are those who wish only to cash in on the
latest fad.  The CyberPunk Believers believe the words 'Fashion' and
'Counterculture' are interchangeable.  The CyberPunk Believers wish to
inform you that The CyberPunk is more than a product of personal
failure and low self-esteem.
  The CyberPunk Believers, misinformed themselves, want to shed
this warped and twisted view of modern society upon you.  The
CyberPunk Believers wish to spread their inability to distiguish
between True and False unto you.

   What is the cause that lies behind The CyberPunk?
  The CyberPunk did not spring up overnight.  The CyberPunk was not
created by technology.  The CyberPunk was not created by abstract
literature written by authors of no talent.  The CyberPunk was not
created by Dr. Timothy Leary.
  CyberPunk is the product of failure.  CyberPunk was created not by
role playing games and books, but by losers seeking a bandwagon to
hop on.
  CyberPunk is the bandwagon.  Failures hop on this bandwagon
and head for the future.
  Too bad. The wagon is headed the the wrong way.

þ Pure Energy in Pud? Huh?

    Little known to most before Pure Energy was in [NuKE] he had long since
    aspired to be one of the few and proud most legendary members of the
    Pizza Underground. But alas we figured he was to much of a punk middle
    aged freak to be allowed to hang around with us so we of course turned
    him down. He got really upset us and well threatened some rather mean
    things but anyways that is better left to the past. After he showed up
    at NO COURiER's[2] funeral we went out and had some coffee. We talked
    for a while and after I refused to 'go back to his place' we decided he
    could now join the ranks of pud. So here is THE first submission he made
    way back when on the faithfull day we turned him down...

    So maybe now you can see why exactly we didn't see it was time to let
    him in but we have since changed our minds and decided that it would
    be great to have him off in the group with us. Yep more than great it
    would be swell even.

r U uh WaReZ du0D?!?1?

   This is a VERY touchy question for everybody.  You know
how degrading it is to ask your parents - Everybody knows
how it is to have that little "talk" with your dad/mom/dog
about the "Birds and the WaReZ"
   To find out if YOU'RE a WaReZ dU0D, simply answer these
questions truthfully.

#1>  Are either one elbows larger than your head?

#2>  Was your house destroyed by Hurricane Andrew?

#3>  Even though you bought a brand new car, does
     everybody still call you a pencil-necked pimply-faced
     geek behind your back?

#4>  Do you call repairing a radio a career?

#5>  Is your girlfriend 14?

#6>  Has your girlfriend failed her GED at least 10 times?

#7>  Do you build metronomes in your free time?

#8>  Are you a member of MaCE ANSi?

#9>  Do you come at the mere mentioning of 0-3 DaY WaReZ?

#10> Do you have an account on Joe's?

  If you answered "YES" to two or more of the questions,
you're a WaReZ dU0D!  YES!!!!11!!
