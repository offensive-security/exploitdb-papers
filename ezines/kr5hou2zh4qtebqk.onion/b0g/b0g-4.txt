Ahh. This article will thoroughly detail the specs on a RML-DX800 
ProSync Server, and all methods of rooting :)

This sucker is found running a modified version of FreeBSD. Usually, 
they have a gay login (via telnet) that says something like:

/-----\
|  __  |
| | |  |
|  -  /
|    /  ro Sync.   RML-DX800
|  --
| |      (c) 1998-1999 KPSX
|_|

My ascii art is gimpy, but you get the idea, the whole word(s) Pro 
Sync are in ascii. The stupidest thing about these boxes is since 
they are sold to fucking clubies who want a stable server, it comes 
with everything setup and preinstalled. There is a default root 
account, but its gimped for security in case managers dont change 
the root password, defaults to GodaBrie123 (prolly the name of the 
dep. chair). There are four other accounts you want to know.

WebCast/WebCast - complete access to apache
SysRight/SysRight - complete access, root, yet not gimped
Control/Control - some stupid conf program, user accounts, etc
General/General - another stupid conf program, but crappier

More stuff to know: heh. Nothing. Managers use these as fucking 
boulders to manage stuff, never really check on em unless theyre 
some kind of high security place.. I love em to death.

Uhm. Some stats? ok.

Ive only actually seen one of these bad ass mofos when I took a tour 
of the Chicago branch FBI building, in their "power room" as they 
call it. It was locked in a BULLET PROOF GLASS ROOM. It looked so 
sekzy I pooped my pants many many times. They said it was worth a 
shitload of money and that no one can touch it except the techs, who 
were a bunch of greasy retards with MCSE's. Notice I said the FBI 
building.. *COUGH COUGH* If you rooted this motherfucker, you would 
instantaneously blow up from the leetness-factor.

                        - Introduction -



   It's the year 2000 and I can say that without a doubt we are 
finally in the midst of a payphone revolution. For a greater majority 
of the 90's, there have been dozens of so-called "break-throughs" in 
the tele-communications industry's payphone sector. 

Some of these breakthroughs helped to shape the way we live by finding 
simple solutions to our complex problems by making the way we 
communicate convenient, easier, and more efficient.

One key player in the innovation of the international payphone market 
is a company by the name of Elcotel Corporation (NASDAQ: ECTL).

Elcotel, based in Sarasota Florida, has rewired the Digital Age and 
the rules of marketing by creating one-on-one relationships between 
businesses and the consumers they are trying to reach. 

In this document I will be lecturing on a wide variety of subjects 
concerning Elcotel's products, ranging from the basics to the more 
advanced information.
All the information contained in this document has been either 
researched and/or discovered by myself or my associate, RT. 

Please Note:

I've made every attempt possible to be accurate, so if for some reason 
I made an error please let me know by e-mailing me the details - I'll 
try to take every e-mail into consideration.

        - Elcotel's 
International Corporate Customers - 


Elcotel has a wide variety of Corporate Customers it deals with on a
regular basis, and not a hell of a lot of people are really aware of 
who these customers are. In this section I've listed off every 
Corporation that currently has an account with Elcotel, including 
their account numbers all in alphabetical order. 

Use this information in any way you wish, but use it responsibly and 
legally.

            - Elcotel 
Payphone Investment [Canada] -


So you want to invest in an Elcotel payphone -- well you've came to 
the right place. In my humble opinion, Northern Telecom has somewhat 
of a monopoly on payphones/data terminals throughout Canada and I'd 
like to see some more competition from Canada Payphone Corporation.

Available on Canada Payphones' web-site is a form that anyone 
(company) interested in purchasing an Elcotel series phone can do so 
by correctly filling it out.
 
The form makes an inquiry about the following information:

  Component Movement
  ------------------

  Q: "What's that crazy noise I hear when I hang up the 9520C?"

  A: That noise you hear when you hang up the phone, is simply the
     Physical Component Switch (PCS) resetting the line after 
recognizing 
     a dialtone.

  In addition, if you were to open up a 9520C model Elcotel and look 
inside,
  you would see a button which operates the Physical Component 
Switch
  labeled 'do not press'. Hmm... I've always wondered what would 
happen
  if I were to press it. ;-p


   Ring Back
   ---------

     All Elcotel 9520C payphones have a built in ringer though only 
approximately 10% of them actually ring when you call them up.

A simple way to test if the 9520C phone you're using is part of the
"10% ringing bracket" is to call it (number located on the phone)
from another payphone next to it.

If there isn't another payphone close to the Elcotel, which is not 
uncommon
(marketing reasons), just use your cell phone and call the line up 
to test if
the 9520C phones nearest YOU can ring!

How many Nortel Millenniums do you know of that ring, let alone 
answer with
a modem carrier when you call them up? NONE.

                        - Physical Administration -


Physical Administration of the Elcotel Payphone has got to be the 
most
exhilarating experiences in the Research and Development of the 
Elcotel
Payphone. Using this brand new hi-tech equipment, learning the ins 
and 
outs, hacking it, and documenting it all as a pioneer explorer is 
absolutely
incredible.

As noted in the 'Hardware Details' section above, the Elcotel 9520C
contains two alarms to help detect vandalism and to help discourage 
theft of 
the equipment.

The main alarm is within the actual phone itself, and if set off for 
a various
reason will send a distress message to the central NCC computer at 
Canada 
Payphone Corporation. Canada Payphone if you don't know, is our 
country's
lovely distributors of Elcotel Payphones. Canada Payphone, located 
in Burnaby 
British Columbia, will receive this distress message on their 
computers which 
then automatically register everything about the phone (including 
the 
location). 

Canada Payphone will then contact either a security company which 
was 
contracted by them, or AT&T security who run their data/voice lines.
Several minutes later, either the contracted security company or 
AT&T will
take a stroll on by to the premises and investigate the matter.
 
Big trouble for the guy who set that alarm off! :-/

--

Hired contractors for Canada Payphone routinely do physical 
administration on 
the phones - installing, programming them, collecting the money, and 
everything 
and anything that they are required to do in their job description. 

Because these contractors are usually lonely guys who have to run 
around all 
the time working with machines, they long for human interaction. 
That is
how my associate RT was able to snag some useful information. All he 
did
was walk up to the guy fixing the phone and started a conversation 
with
him.

In a calm manner, RT asked several questions about the phones which 
the 
contractor was glad to share with him. The information he gave RT 
has been
added to various sections of this document, and for that we THANK 
HIM. :)

Alarm PIN Information
---------------------

Disabling the alarm on the Elcotel series phones, is relatively 
simple. 
What you're required to enter is a three digit PIN, which if 
correctly entered,
will turn off the local alarm in the phone. This means that the 
static 
connection from the phone to Canada Payphone's NCC computer in 
Burnaby BC will 
be cut off. However, if you enter an incorrect PIN you'll get an 
error message 
on the display.


(1) How do I disable the alarm?

- By picking up the receiver on the phone, pressing #, and entering 
the
three digit PIN.

(2) How do I know I'm doing it correctly?

- You'll know you're doing it correctly when you see ### on the 
display...
the ### represent the PIN. If you entered the right PIN, the display 
message
will say "OK".

(3) What is the PIN?

- Canada Payphone, (being the obvious guys that they are) decided to 
choose
 a PIN code that would be easy to remember so they picked 'CPC' as 
the PIN
 code. CPC standing for Canada Payphone Corporation, wh00p. 

(4) How do I enable the alarm again?

- Pick up the receiver (if it was hung up) and type #CPC. 

- Then hang up the receiver and try to wait for at least twenty 
seconds
before using the phone again. Why? You have to give the phone some 
time
to reconfigure itself.

- You'll know you can use the phone again when you hear the 
components
in the Elcotel shifting.

--

Administration PIN Information
------------------------------

The benefit of Physical Administration over Remote Administration
is that you're not required to enter an ID of some sort before
entering the PIN. 

What you're required to enter is an eight digit PIN, which if 
correctly 
entered, will allow you to open the phones' case granting you full 
access
to the Elcotel's administration system.

Giving you the ability to:

- empty out the cash box 

- change screen messages

- administrate rate tables

- see how many calls were made with the phone in a given time period

- see how many days the phone has not been in use

- debit card information

- several security parameters

- etcetera

             - Elcotel 9520C Phone Seizing Problems - 


9520C Phone Seizing Problem #1
------------------------------

- On the Elcotel 9520C model phones which haven't been upgraded with 
the
the new "fool-proof chip" have a severe flaw;

Recently Canada Payphone decided that it would have its calls routed 
through
AT&T's switching system instead of their own. The reason for this 
may be due
to AT&T's size and ability to handle several calls without getting 
the 
'bottle-neck' problem like Canada Payphone may have had.

Now due to this change-over, a problem occurred with the 9520C model 
Elcotel's
causing a line-seizing problem. Essentially this problem would allow 
a phreaker
to exploit it to make as many free local phone calls as they wished.


This is how it's done:

- Pick up the receiver
 
- Enter 25¢ for the call
 
- Call someone, and be sure they hang up the telephone after the 
call is
  completed.

- The line will not be seized at this time, the mouthpiece will not 
be 
  muted, but the keypad will be disabled.

- With the receiver still in your hand, place your tone dialer on 
the 
  mouth piece and begin to punch in a phone number or play the pre-
programmed
  DTMF tones. Either way should work successfully.

Remember that this trick will not work on ALL 9520C series Elcotel 
payphones.
ONLY the 9520C's that haven't had their chip upgraded to prevent 
this type of
fraud will work. 


  ++ Note: 

  Sometimes when dialing a number with the 9520C phone you will
  get a number that is either 'Not In Service' or 'Cannot Be 
Completed',
  the line might not hang itself up. In this case, you could use the
  same techniques documented above to exploit the seizing problem 
and
  make free local calls.

  ++

9520C Phone Seizing Problem #2
------------------------------

- On the Elcotel 9520C model phones which have been upgraded with 
the
  the new "fool-proof chip" have a severe flaw;

The new chips in the Elcotel 9520C's apparently fixed 30% of the 
phones
in Canada which allow the use of a tone-dialer to make "free local 
calls"
when a line doesn't seize properly. The newer chips apparently do 
not allow
the use of a keypad or DTMF tones in the chance that the line does 
not 
seize after a call is completed, thus securing the flaw.

However, there is a way around the newer chips' "security features". 
If done correctly, the trick will allow a phreaker to exploit a 
different 
type of line seizing problem unknown by the Telco and unrecognized 
by the 
newer 9520C chips.


This is how it's done: 

- Pick up the receiver

- Dial '611' (don't worry it's toll-free)

- Immediately after, press the bi-lingual button (English to French) 
located 
  next to the phones' keypad. If done correctly, the payphone will 
reset
  causing the connection through AT&T's (the CO) SS7 based switching 
to end.

- At this point you can use the keypad to dial any local number you 
wish.

- Or use a tone-dialer by placing it on the mouth piece of the 
  receiver and begin to punch in a local phone number, or simply 
play the 
  pre-programmed DTMF tones.

 
The only explanation I have for why the Elcotel 9520C resets the 
line
causing a seizing problem, is due to Elcotel's inability to develop 
a chip 
that prevents various types of payphone fraud. 

If Elcotel can simply keep its promise of developing so-called 
"fraud 
resistant" payphones by having regular security audits before they 
ship their 
products to their corporate customers, then they wouldn't have to 
worry about 
lost revenue caused by phreakers who abuse these vulnerabilities.

It's only common sense, RIGHT PEOPLE?! :)



                        - Remote Administration -


In my previous document titled 'CPC; Elcotel Eclipse Smart Phone' I 
gave 
mention about how one could remotely administer a payphone as long 
as they
had the proper knowledge to do so. 
 
I briefly explained that you'd be required to have the payphones' 
uniquely
assigned number, the software to administer it and the ID/PIN to do 
so.
In the document I mentioned that once inside the system you'd have 
the
ability to change rate tables, change scrolling messages, turn the 
payphone 
on, etc.

It's been five months since that document was written, and the 
information
that I gave was only general and didn't give specific system 
details.


What have I discovered/accomplished since then? 
-----------------------------------------------

%% Payphone Numbers %%


- I now have a list of several Elcotel 9520C payphone numbers which 
several
people have helped me compile. At the moment I have Canadian 
payphone numbers 
from Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Victoria. The number of 
payphones 
listed so far is in the twenties, and it keeps on growing.

The document (Elcotel CPC 9520C; National COCOT Number Compilation) 
can be 
seen by visiting: 

http://home.edmc.net/~theclone/Elcotel/elcotel_compilation.txt



%% Software %%


In December of 1999, I started to get into the software side of it 
all
and posted several different Remote Administration programs on 
Nettwerked
for download. The programs made it easier for the phreak and hacker 
to
get into the core of the Elcotel system without worrying about 
having to
search for them. 


PNM Plus is a simple stripped down Administration Tool which can be 
used 
on the Elcotel. The minimum requirement however is that you have 
Windows
3.11. 

Download: http://thehomeworkpage.tripod.com/pnmdemo.tar.gz

-

PollQuest Version 1.6.0 (Commercial Release) or 'International 
Payphone 
Network Management System' is a nice full software package (beta) 
used for 
administering the Elcotel, and is the default program used on the 
9520C
models.

%% Remote Administration  %%


ID --

  When connected to the Elcotel Payphone remotely, you'll be 
prompted
for an Identification number. Now from what we're aware of, the ID 
numbers 
are assigned differently in accordance to the location of the 
payphone.

Also, from what we were told by Elcotel installers (they're great 
for insider
information) the Elcotel Remote Identification numbers range from 
8000 and
up. Knowing this, we can presumably say that all ID's are programmed 
to be
four digits - or at least four digits by default.


PIN --

  One hunch I have is that the PIN alpha-numeric codes used for 
Remotely 
Administering the Elcotel payphones are exactly the same number of 
digits (8) 
one would be required to enter if they wanted to carry out Physical
Administration.
 
Remote Administration PIN codes using a Canada wide default, are 
programmed
into all Elcotel Payphones? 

Perhaps, and the assumption isn't too broad either if we consider 
there is
a default PIN used for physically disabling the Elcotel alarm (see 
Physical 
Administration). 


%% Software Options %%


Previously I gave reference to Rate Tables, but the information 
given was
a tad too general and didn't talk in enough detail to help the 
reader
clearly understand what they'd be in for once they connected to the
payphone remotely.

Below is the actual table options from one of the many Remote Admin 
Software
C programs accessible and fully available on my preliminary archive:

Browsing over this table, we see there are so many different 
options.
Not only that, but the options available are surely useful for 
anyone wishing 
to collect information on Canada Payphone customers.


                - Central Administration Computer(s) [9520C] - 


  All Elcotel 9520C series phones are pre-programmed to collect 
statistics
about the amount of money they made, how many calls were placed (and 
for
how long), how many days the phone has gone without use, and so on.

You'd wonder how Canada Payphone would get this information, right?

What they have done is programmed all the 9520C Elcotel's to 
directly
send all its statistical information to the headquarters of Canada 
Payphone
via modem - 14.4 data-transmission twice or more a month. 

The headquarters, in Burnaby British Columbia, have a central 
administration
computer (or computers) which store the history every 9520C payphone 
statistic
ever generated within Canada.

If you were wondering what specific number the payphone calls in 
order to send 
the statistics, the carrier number is (604)-717-6532.

When you call that number up with the Elcotel 9520C phone, you are 
given a
credit of between 5-20 cents - on the display timer which usually 
counts
the number of minutes a user is on the phone was instead counting 
down
from 40 minutes.

Which brings me to the assumption that the maximum amount of time it 
takes 
for the 9520C to send all of its statistical information to the HQ 
is 
approximately 40 minutes in length.

                           - Upcoming Projects -


In the upcoming months you can expect me to be involved in several 
Elcotel 
projects, which for the most part will coincide with topics or past 
projects 
written in this documentation.

The upcoming projects in this section are only a general idea of 
what is
to come in the near future. My ideas and plans change without 
warning, meaning 
that I cannot guarantee anything that I boast about in this section.  


` Audio samples to be added to Nettwerked [The Clone]

` Elcotel Central Administration datatapping (A "how to" manual) 
[The Clone]

` Miscellaneous Elcotel information to be added to this document 
[RT/The Clone] 

` "PROJECT: Elcotel 9520C skan of (780)-420-9XXX" [The Clone]

` + much more!


                                - Credits -

  I'd like to personally thank my associate 'RT' for working with me
to learn everything there is to know about the Elcotel series 
phones,
and of course for his contributions to this file.



                                - Conclusion - 


  In conclusion, I'd just like to note that this document will be 
updated
periodically as I learn more about the Elcotel payphones' 
architecture and
its security parameters. As Elcotel Telecommunications develops more 
technically advanced communication devices (ie. GrapeVine - 05/00),
you can be damn sure I'll be the one hacking it and writing another 
document to share with the rest of the phreaking community.

MOST OFFENSIVE COCKTAIL
This is available from a few select bars in New York. It contains 
tomato
juice, a double shot of vodka, a spoonful of French mustard and a dash 
of
lime. It is not mixed, but served with a tampon (unused)instead of a
cocktail umbrella and is known as a 'C*nt Pump'.

How The Hell can you own a skool network with DOS prompt?  

Well, if it is on a good old NT, then hell yeah is possible.
Is possible with winblows 9x, but I am not going to get into it.  

Most skools don't fucking know what the hell linux is.  My skool 
doesn't :).  My skool run on NT 4 and I think whoever set up the 
network is an idiot.  He left print and file sharing.  On the first 
day of skool. I was checking shit out and already the REGEDIT32 
is open for screw up.  

   

   Requirement :

                         NT 4 (window 9x is okay)

                         file and printer sharing

                         puter (duh!)

                         LAN up (really?)



    To check rather your skool puter are NT 4, simply wait for the 
screen to bootup and see.  If it is then YAY!!  Then you go to 
dos prompt if it is not blocked.  If it is and u can get into 
explorer then do so and find it.  Else, look for Netscape and go 
to c:/winnt/system32 and search for commnd prompt.  If you 
dunno cause you're a dumbass then look for qbasic.exe hidden 
in c:/winnt/system32.  After run it and type "SHELL" without 
quote and run it.  There you got into DOS.  Happy?  Not really...
moving on, we check if we're connected on LAN we use the "net 
view" command.  IF so, you should see a list of computer you're 
hook up with.  To see if you're share with em, net view a certain 
computer and see in the MAC contain 20...I dink...I forgot :), If 
so, the last part is to use "net use"  to connect it.  for example 
you can connect to a computer doing this.  net view g: \\0wn
then the computer 0wn would be your G: drive. Last part is to 
see if they have password.  if so brute force it.  But majority 
they don't cause they're worthless piece of shit!

    Okay that you learn new skills today, lets move on.  Most of 
the time your school computer is connected to a main computer. 
This is when the fun begins.  PLEASE DO DESTROY STUFF FOR 
THE PHUN OF IT!! haha, just kidding man. Anyway, see what 
they have.  IF u love website defacing and want to do something 
similar, you can see if the background hooked up to the main 
server.  Hey it happen to my skool computer.  After, you 
download the background graphic and change the shit.  After 
you would have to copy it back to the drive you mapped.  Okay 
once that is done then pray that they didn't log you down.  Once 
u did all that then wait till the next day where all the computer 
reboot, and BAM! your nice background displaying on all 
computer system.  Kinda lame, but it proof thats leaving 
sharing is bad.  Something little like this can lead to total 
catastrophe.  Maybe you can tell your teacher that you did this 
and they will let you be NT admin. haha doubt it.  

  

   So watever........drunk....zz.zzz.zzzz.z.zZzz.z.zZzz.zz.Zz

Technologically Challenged?
The following is an excerpt from an article in the Wall Street 
Journal that might make you feel better:


1. Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to 
"Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the 
"Any" key is.

2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was 
hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be 
the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.

3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining 
that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old 
diskettes. The customer had stuck labels on the diskettes, then 
rolled them into his typewriter to type on the labels.

4. Another customer was asked to send a copy of her defective 
diskettes. A few days later, a letter arrived from the customer 
along with photocopies of the floppies.

5. A Dell technician advised a customer to put his troubled floppy 
back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to 
hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and 
crossing the room to close the door to his room.

6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer 
to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the tech 
discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it 
in front of the monitor screen and hitting the "send" key.

7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no 
longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and 
water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys 
and washing them individually.

8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged 
because his computer had told him he was "bad and an invalid". The 
tech explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid" 
responses shouldn't be taken personally.

9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. 
He told the technician that the computer had said it "couldn't find 
printer". The user had tried turning the computer screen to face the 
printer, but that his computer still couldn't "see" the printer.

10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get 
her new Dell computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was 
plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed 
the power button. Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot 
pedal and nothing happened." The "foot pedal" turned out to be the 
computer's mouse.

11. Another customer called Compaq Tech Support to say her brand-new 
computer wouldn't work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it 
in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. 
When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she 
asked, "What Power switch?"

12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:
Caller: "Hello, is this Tech Support ?"
Tech: "Yes, it is. How may I help you?"
Caller: "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my 
warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?"
Tech: "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"
Caller: "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."
Tech: "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's because I am. 
Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a trade show?"
Caller: "It came with my computer. I don't know anything about a 
promotional. It just has '4X' on it."
At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he 
couldn't stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been 
using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and 
snapped it off the drive!

13. Another IBM customer had trouble installing software and rang 
for support. " I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to 
put in the second disk, and I had some problems with that disk. When 
it said to put in the third disk - I couldn't even fit it in...." 
The user hadn't realized that "Insert Disk 2" meant to remove Disk 1 
first.

do, you wanna show your teachers that they know....nothing?
wanna show them that you 0wn them, and make them ph33r?????
wanna walk around school and going up to the cute chix0rs, &
get them with your sleek k-rad hax0r stylish moves!$%?@#?@?
Well then follow everything I say in this article, and then
they will fear(or make text line up at the end like I do!!)

I bet this is the longest fuckin sentence you've ever seen!

FoolProof:

Bah, my school, and almost every school i've been to runs Fool Proof 
Security There are like super++ ninja ways around this, and all..Some 
I have conquered in the last few days, in writing this! FoolProof may 
be fool proof, but who's sayin your a fool? ok...

!unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf unf 
unf unf!
You boot up, and all, and the crazy's locked up the desktop so you 
can't bust out your sleek h4x0r l1ke skillz. First thing, if you wanna 
put the school in fear mode, you can change the start menu size! when 
you normally try, it just goes back to its original, normal size! To 
k-rad hax0rate this ghetto feature you RIGHT CLICK, then LEFT CLICK 
when still holding the right button down and drag it to a cool size, 
like 50% of the screen! Fear that Mrs Johnson!@$#%#$%

Now you say, I hax0red the start task bar, now what....I can not h4x0r 
the BG of the desktop....wrong again@$% like...this one only works on 
some computers if you go to like start, then programs, then games, and 
you see a Puzzle game in there, you are a true h4x0r, open it up, and 
in like options it will allow you to open a bitmap to puzzlize! open 
like a file you edited in ghetto paint and saved on a floppy, you 
dont actually have to play with this image but you then go into the 
options menu or something, and click Save As, and save it as
the background picture!!! fear me fear me... Thats as far as I got 
with makin my own desktop themes, in computer class, but nows where 
the fun starts!@#$$@

NOVELL:
If you got Novell network shit, this worked for me once, and 
like I think that allot of schools are dumb like this, when the login 
screen pops up, login as Admin, and for the password type: password 
this may work, because it might be the default login, it was at my 
school... and then the teachers didnt edit it cause they login as 
THEIR accounts, usually their first initial, followed, by their last 
name. Now you got m0re power than your teacher, you should like
maybe set up an account with read/write privileges, incase they 
change the PW. I dont know, it may be a bad idea, but who knows...If 
that did not work, then look around, try the ninja MS word trick in 
the last b0g issue. If the school is cool enuff to let you have ms-
dos, you are in luck...though that foolproof crap won't let you do 
crap in dos either, there is 1 hole that I caught, with my k-rad unix 
like skillz, at the prompt, I tried cat did not work, so then I
was like oh! DOS, and typed echo, it replied "Echo on" I was like 
stupid slut now I typed echo "1 y 4m j00r g0d" and it echoed it, so I 
was like wow lemme bust out my cool file thingy dillingy, and I typed 
echo "" > c:\coolfiletodel
and it made that file new style, I was like wow$%% so I tried to 
echo over an existing file(c:\autoexec.bat) and it worked!#$%@#$% now 
fool proof still ran next time, so I figure like doing some more 
ghetto registry editing, and crazy stuff like that...I cd to a network 
drive, and it puts me in Z:\public\ h0h0h
im in public, mad w4r3z 0-day shit there, and I did a dir *.exe /p 
and busted out some really cool shit, first there was send, I read 
that help file, and I then typed send "fuck off" EVERYONE /B and heard 
allot of bings, and like some freak sent this message saying "fuck 
off" to everyone! the teacher was amazed
I was like whoa, and all the computers said STUDENT[44] fuck off I 
was like !
I think I am student 44 h0h0h0h they can trace me, I fear, Im 
busted, but she didnt! I then realized, your number goes with login, 
not always that the last person to login is the highest number, I 
guess its random, but I then use the ninja skillz to send computer 44 
a message, from the one next to me, and then I got a message! fear 
that fools. SEND "hi tak" 44 /B and b00m, I got the msg and in it was 
that computers number, it works!#@$% so then I look in z/public
again, and see whoami.exe, and like DOH its easy like that, run it, 
and it'll say connection: 44 and thats your number, if you wanna send 
msges!@#$ now you can k-rad h4x0r the chicks, and send them msges, 
just like Kevin Picknik @$@#
your a true h4x0r now. There is like another program called 
NLIST.exe and you can see all devices, and users on the network or 
something NLIST * will do it so you can see the teachers login, and 
brute force it! there is also a thingy called NETUSER.exe witch you 
can edit setting, and shit, set msges to off, so when tak is sitting 
next to you sending you 0-day through msges, you can like not be 
annoyed by it..Also remember you are logged in as student or 
whatever..
so you in fact are that user, and you can control him, you can 
change your PW cause you are him, and thats like npass.exe or some 
shit, and Im guessing you can like kill processes, maybe like 
everyones processes, since they are all you...in a way h3h dont know 
yet...Now if y0u cr4ck r00t, there's an 0-dayz0r joint called 
NETADMIN.exe, and you run it, GUI style, and like edit shit, add 
yourself, and do all that ghetto shit that we love to do! I know, I 
just like thought of an idea, if j00r root, like do a su, or like find 
out the teachs password, or change it, and send a message to everyone 
saying "I am a loser!"
and like the people will fear, and then like change her password, 
and msg her "y0u are 0wned" and as they look around, say "I see you 
but you cant see me!"
and she will like shrivel up and die. Until everyones laughing at 
the message from her, and your the only one whistling, that could give 
it away, they will then change the admin password, and h4x0r you out, 
good thing you got your fuday backup account ready, with all 
permissions, so you can change it again & send her something like "j00 
cann0t st0p m3h!@$#" and they will be 0wned2x@#$

if none of these work, that's cause Im a complete retard, and you 
should walk up to your teacher, and kick her, and say "g1b m3 tha 
c0dez f00" and then you do not need to do all this h4x0ring, you got 
the Gibson password fools@#$%@#$

Foreword

Welcome children, welcome. This the story of a group of 4 turtles - 
predecessors of the well known Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Yes, 
hiding in the depths of the alleyways in New York City - are the 
Teenage Mutant Nigger Turtles. Because of their extremely dark 
complexions, they were shunned by the city, the state, the world. 
Indeed, we can all look past the species.. but black people have no 
place above the grounds here in the U.S.! On to the T.M.N.T. 
chronicles...


Before we begin let's take a quick looks at the characters.. The 
left column are the original characters and the right column are the 
'niggerized' characters.

Scene 1 - The CrackPad

Our Teenage Nigger heroes (Coonatello, LowRideO, MickeyJiggalo, 
Crackael) lie in the west side of New York City, conversing with 
their Muslim leader Splinter-X. Their crackpad, coated in grime and 
nigger residue, has long since been shut down and quarantined. Deep 
inside the bowels of the confinement, they hide in the shadows, 
dealing crack to young nigger children and shooting themselves full 
of heroine.

LowRideO: Hey yo nigger! Pass me some of dat shit!

MickeyJiggalo: Fuck ya'll man. This shit be mine homes.

Splinter-X: Please, you all must learn to live in harmony with the 
world and help people. 

Coonatello: Shut yo nappy rat ass up. 

Coonatello pulls out his .44 and caps the Paki in the head. 

Coonatello: Motha Fucka! He been holdin us back ya'll! Look where we 
at! We in some fucking shitty crackhouse where no one be comin to! 
We need to get our shit out on the street niggaz!

Crackael: DIIIIID SOME-SOME ONE SAY A MOTHERFUCKING WORD CRACK MOTHA

our shit that's why we ain't neva make no money sellin crack fool!

Crackael: DIIIIID SOME-SOME ONE SAY A MOTHERFUCKING WORD CRACK MOTHA 
FUCKAZ? I HEARD CRACK@#^@^!

With that, the turtles leave their crackpad and venture on to the 
streets of New York City.

Scene 2 - NYC Streets

LowRideO: Aiight Niggaz. This how it's going down: Coon, you take 
the abandoned warehouse on 1st street, Mickey, you take the whole 
road the 32nd Precinct is on, Crackael.. you take the school, and 
I'll take the Abandoned warehouse on 2nd street. We'll meet back at 
dis motha fucka in 5 hourz!

Crackael, being the brains of the group speaks up of the flaw in the 
plan.

Crackael: MAN.. WHAT THE HELL YOU TALKING BOUT SMACK NIGGA 
FUCKA??!?$^@ YOU-YOU-YOU CAIN'T BE SENDING M-ME TO NO SCHOOL 
GROUNDS.. NO BUSINESS WILL BE THERE MOTHA RICE PICKA!

LowRideO: Good thinkin yo! You take the abandoned warehouse on 3rd 
street!

With that they dispurse and strut to their locations. 

5 hours later..

The turtles regroup and calculate their profits.

LowRideO: Yo Crackael! What - What the fuck happened to 
MickeyJiggalo and Coonatello yo?!

Crackael: YO MAN!! I-I DUNNO YO! FUCKIN YEAH SHIT RICE PICKERS 
DISSAPEARED MOTHER FUCKA!

Suddenly, a figure appears atop the winding trail of worn pavement. 
The sun is setting, casting the figure in a black shadow. As he 
draws nearer, LowRideO notices he's dragging something rather heavy 
with him..

LowRideO: Coonatello! What the fuck - MickeyJiggalo! What the fuck 
happened yo?

Coonatello: Man, you sent this motha fucka to the cop street! 2 
minutes into a deal these blues pull out a shotgun and cap his ass! 

LowRideO glances down at Mickey and notices he's gushing nigga blood 
all over the place. 

LowRideO: How many times did those fuckas shoot him?!

Coonatello: I don't know mang! I heard about 41 gunshots yo! I had 
to drag his 467 pound fat ass all the way from 1st street! 

MickeyJiggalo: A-A-Avenge my death.. ni-niggaz..

With that a dark stream of blood trickles from his mouth and he 
takes his last breath.

LowRideO: Yo, let's get the fuck out of here man!

With the emerging sirens in the background, the 3 remaining turtles 
head back to their crackpad to develop a better plan.

Scene 3 - Back at the CrackPad    

Coonatello: Mang, yo, g, homie, funk.. I don't know what the hell 
went wrong wit dat plan, yo.

LowRideO: Me either, fucka! It was fool-proof! Three abandoned 
warehouses and a cop street mang!

Jerry Curl: You need to visit more populated area, man!

The turtles turn in surprise to the voice.. A well dressed white 
man, with gold decorating himself all over, stand in the door frame.

LowRideO: Who the FUCK is dis chump ass white boy?

Jerry Curl: This CHUMP can make your nigger ass some money, in 
return for a few favors.

Coonatello: Mang, what you talkin about, we doing fine!

LowRideO: Shut up! What favors do we need to do?

Jerry Curl: You'll be slaves, picking cotton on my plantation.

LowRideO: What can you do for us, mang?

Jerry Curl: I can pay you in small amounts and make you work long 
tedious hours with little food.

Coonatello: Man, we already got all that! We wan't sumtin else you 
crack fool!

Crackael: DIIIIID SOME-SOME ONE SAY A MOTHERFUCKING WORD CRACK MOTHA 
FUCKAZ? I HEARD CRACK@#^@^!

Jerry Curl pulls out his .357 magnum and shoots Crackael in the 
forehead.
He drops to the ground with a thud.

Jerry Curl: First we rid ourselves of the crack head.

The two remaining turtles glance at each other in horror and remain 
quiet.

Jerry Curl: Now, get in my car boys, we're going for a ride. Don't 
forget to sit on the plastic you niggers!

With that, the three pile into Jerry Curl's 1995 Buick LeSabre. 

Jerry Curl: Actually, get in the trunk you fools. You're already 
stinking my car up!

-    At a high-school basketball game in February, Oklahoma City
Police officer Eldridge Wyatt became dissatisfied that no fouls
were being called on "No. 21" and walked onto the court to point
out the player's elbowing to the referees.  When referee Stan
Guffey told Wyatt to leave the officiating to him, Wyatt arrested
Guffey.  Guffey was unarrested a few minutes later so that the game
could continue, but when a reporter asked Wyatt after the game what
had happened, Wyatt tried to arrest him, too.

-    Lynne F. Herron, 33, was hired recently as a municipal bus
driver in Cleveland by the Regional Transit Authority.  She had
just been fired as a municipal train driver after an accident that
injured 14 people, which she caused by deliberately disengaging a
safety system.  The city's labor contract requires that anyone
fired for a train accident be rehired as a bus driver.

-    A West Chester, Pa., urologist reported in an issue of
`Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality' last year that a man had
checked himself into an emergency room with pain resulting from a
swollen and apparently lacerated scrotum.  Days after the doctor
repaired the patient's condition, the man confided that he had been
masturbating by holding his penis against the canvas drive-belt of
a piece of machinery at work during his lunch hour when he leaned
too close as he approached orgasm and suffered an industrial
accident.  He then used a heavy duty stapling gun to close the
wound.

-    Motorcyclist David Gripon was injured in a collision near
Escondito, Calif., in July when he lost control of his bike on
Interstate 15.  As Gripon came alongside a car with bare feet
sticking out of the passenger window, he reached out to tickle them
and ran into the car in front of him.

-    Montesano, Wash., government prosecutor Steward Menefee
announced in November that he would not seek a tougher penalty
against convicted murderer Lee Bake, because the required
"aggravated circumstances" were not present.  Bake had gouged the
victim's eyes with a screwdriver, stabbed her to death, and drunk
her blood.

-    Malaysian Deputy Interior Minister Megat Junid Ayob told an
anti-drug conference in January in Kuala Lampur that shortages in
heroin and cannabis have caused some addicts to get high by
sniffing fresh cow dung.  Addicts put a coconut shell over the
party, with a hole at the top for sniffing.

-    Recently in a New York City supermarket, according to a `New
York Daily News' story, a customer became upset that another woman
was abusing the maximum limit for items at an express checkout line
and precipitated a loud argument, which culminated with the angry
woman shouting at the queue-abuser, "I spit into your groceries." 
the alleged queue-abuser was the wife of reputed mobster John
Gotti.  Victoria Gotti said she "used connections" to trace the
woman's license plate, went to the woman's home, and dumped a box
of dog feces on her.

-    In December, Washington State Reformatory officials they had
erred in obliging a 53 year old inmate's job preference to work in
the prison's printing plant.  He was serving time for forgery, and
officials uncovered, during a routine inspection of his quarters,
forged birth certificates, marriage licenses, and a paycheck stub. 
An official said the prison tries to get inmates jobs "based on
their interests."

-    Transsexual Baroness Maria Thyssen von Hexun, formerly James
Gonzales, was sentenced to four years in prison in Denver in
October, for bilking an elderly woman out of several thousand
dollars.  As her sentence was pronounced, the 6 foot, 220 pound
baroness rolled her eyes and objected, "I've been involved with
nothing but a bunch of jerks.  They don't listen.  They lose
things."  Her attorney told the judge that "these things happen,"
referring to the baroness' fantasies that she was a baroness.

-    Prison escapee James Sanders was captured by federal agents
at his home in Stinnett, Texas, in January after 17 years on the
lam, during which he had established a new life, married, and
fathered a daughter.  Agents were tipped off when Sanders, out of
curiosity, telephoned the FBI to ask whether they were still
pursuing James Sanders.

-    In February, Marc Cienkowski, 26, confessed to the murder last
July of his friend, Michael Klucznik, 31, in Doylestown Borough,
Pa., after a dispute over a game of Monopoly.  Cienkowski shot
Klucznik through the heart, using a bow and arrow.  According to
the district attorney, "[Cienkowski] wanted to be the car rather
than the thimble or the hat." 

-    The Reverend Glen Summerford was convicted in February of
attempted murder of his wife in Scottsboro, Alabama.  A jury found
that he had forced his wife to stick her hand into a cage of
rattlesnakes (which he handles in his services at his Church of
Jesus With Following Signs in addition to drinking strychnine and
touching live electrical wires), saying that she had to die because
he wanted to marry another woman.  Much of the trial testimony
concerned which of the spouses had sinned or "backslid" more.  
(While Summerford was in jail, his inadequately supervised
parishioner, Clyde Crossfield, was bitten on both hands by a
rattlesnake he was handling.)

-    Scott D. Carpenter, 27, filed a lawsuit in September against
the management company of Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh and
its chief concessionaire because they allowed him to buy too many
beers during a 1989 Steelers game and then failed to warn him about
the danger of riding on escalator handrails, on which he was
injured in a drunken fall.

-    In Tacoma, Washington, Christine Lauritzen filed a lawsuit
against her husband, Bret, last year for negligence that subjected
her to injury.  Bret's error was in ignoring Christine's driving
instructions:  During a visit to Miami, Florida, they wound up in
a bad section of town, where they were eventually robbed and where
she suffered a severe arm injury.

-    A newspaper in Ireland reported in February that 38 Irish
soccer fans recently won a lawsuit against two bus companies that
had caused them to miss the 1990 World Cup games in Italy.  They
sued because the bus drivers drove too slowly (an average of 20
mph) on two trips, causing them to miss one game and to miss a
scheduled ferry that would have transported them to another game.

-    Takashi Nakayama, 25, filed a lawsuit in December in a court
in Niigata, Japan, against his mother and grandmother, seeking
about $1,548 in damages because his grandmother had thrown out his
comic-book collection without his consent and his mother had failed
to stop her.

-    Magoo Dorcy, 42, announced his candidacy for mayor of Dover,
Delaware, despite having pleaded guilty in Columbus, Ohio, three
years ago for molesting a 5 year old girl.

-    Harold W. "Tony" Glacken was charged last year with running
a fraudulent auto-inspection scheme.  Upon announcing his candidacy
for sheriff in St Louis, Missouri, recently, Glacken said, "I just
decided it was time I get involved and get this community
straightened out. I'm tired of all the [county's] bad publicity."

-    In Salem, Oregon, former Baptist minister Joe Lutz withdrew
from the U.S. Senate race in January, saying that his "family
values" campaign had lost credibility because he had abandoned his
wife to marry another woman and reportedly was $2,000 behind in
child support payments.

-    Donald L. Traxler, newly installed mayor of Ada, Ohio, and
education professor at Ohio Northern University, declared in
December that he would take office later in the month, as
scheduled, despite his December 13 arrest when rangers observed him
masturbating at a local park.

-    Sherman T. Miller, running for sheriff in Van Buren County in
southeastern Iowa, was jailed in March, suspected by authorities
to be part of a burglary ring that had been stealing farm
equipment.  Said Miller, "It's just a bunch of political nonsense
to take me out of the race."

-    Poin Adams, candidate for sheriff in Amarillo, Texas, was
found guilty in 1990 of fraud for tampering with his vehicle
inspection sticker.  He had crudely drawn a "1" on his windshield,
to obscure the "0" in 1990, so that his sticker would appear to be
valid in 1991.

-    On October 12, a clerk on duty at a convenience store in
Abilene, Texas, was persuaded by a man to accept a $100 bill that
was accurately printed (1950 series) in every detail -- except that
it was 12 inches long and 5 inches wide.

-    Last fall, two men holed up in the Maine State Library in
Augusta for two months in makeshift living quarters that a security
official said included "everything you could think of," before they
were discovered.  Andre V. Jatho, 20, was charged with burglary,
but the other man moved out.  For sustenance, the two men had
looted various state supply rooms (taking an unusually large
quantity of pudding). 

-    Theaters in North Carolina recently began showing, as a short
feature, a state-funded film advocating teenage sexual abstinence. 
In "The Power To Create Life," a teenage couple in a car are
contemplating having sex until the sky lights up and an alien
emperor implores, "You have the power to create life.  Don't abuse
it!"  The kids decide to go to a movie instead.

-    Minneapolis prosecutors were expecting a long and difficult
child molesting trial against Robert G. Swan because the
incriminating photographs they had of him blurred his face.  Then,
in January, his wife brought Swan, who was in jail, a fresh change
of clothing for his court appearance, giving him the very articles
he was wearing in the photographs.  After the clothing turned up,
Swan quickly pleaded guilty.

-    Xavier Hunter, 26, was arrested in Chicago in December of
robbing the Citibank Federal Savings Bank.  Unknown to him,
President Bush was speaking at the Chicago Board of Trade, less
than a block away, at the time, and the neighborhood was thus full
of police officers.  As Hunter exited the bank, the chemical dye
pack in his bounty exploded, alerting the many nearby officers, who
chased him down despite his futile attempt to abandon the money by
throwing it into the air as he ran.

-    In St Louis in January, Thomas Hall pulled into what looked
like a fast food restaurant's drive thru to place an order. 
However, the drive thru speaker he yelled into was an intercom
stand at the Area III St Louis police station.  An officer came out
and arrested Hall for DUI.  (The next day, after Hall's arrest made
local news, DJ "Wacky Pat" Fortune drove up to the same intercom
stand to out a gag for his listeners.  However, an officer checked
Fortune out on the computer, discovered unpaid traffic violations,
and arrested him as a fugitive.)

-    James Bridgewater, 32, was arrested in Kankakee, Illinois,
after a mishap at the First of America Bank's drive-in window.  He
was carrying two white sacks, one containing money for deposit and
the other containing two grams of marijuana and rolling papers. 
He put the wrong bag in the pneumatic tube.

-    To quell unruly seventh graders in Irvington, New Jersey, in
February, substitute teacher Monique Bazile, 57, cast a voodoo
spell on the class.  According to pupils, Bazile began shaking and
chanting, threw ritual powder on the kids, and warned them that
their houses would burn down because of their rowdiness.  Criminal
charges of endangering the welfare of a child and making
terroristic threats were brought against her.

-    Milford, Utah, high-school teacher Cherry Florence was fired
in February for an indiscretion.  According to the local board of
education, after the school, for health reasons, interviewed
students individually as to their level of sexual activity,
Florence released to her classes a list of which of the school's
170 teenagers were virgins.

-    Acting Principal Steven Stocker, 31, voted Fredericksburg,
Virginia, outstanding young educator in 1988, was arrested in
January after he engaged a 9 year old girl in what the district
attorney called a servant-master game.  Stocker, the servant, had
allegedly kissed the girl's feet and sucked her toes.

-    The board of education in Worthington Hills, near Columbus,
Ohio, disciplined teacher Alan Brady in February on charges that
he poked a student teacher in her backside with a fork and that he
had third-graders line up and jump on and hit a fellow student who
had been bad.

-    Immokalee, Florida, substitute teacher, Krystal Gail Allen,
was fired in January after parents complained that she described
her sex life in great detail to an eighth-grade geography class and
invited students to share their own tales with her.  One student
had recorded the class.

-    In January, burglars at Rich's department store in Salem,
Massachusetts, were forced to flee empty handed after the welding
torch they were using to break into a safe accidentally ignited the
money inside, causing a fire and setting off the store's smoke
alarm.

-    Daniel Hendricks, 34, of St Louis, was charged in February
with several counts of aggravated battery in Tampa for ramming at
least six cars on an interstate highway and forcing others off the
road as he sped at 100mph toward nearby Clearwater, Florida, where
Barbara Bush was speaking.  Hendricks told police he had to warn
Mrs. Bush that Saddam Hussein was preparing to invade the U.S.

contracted with a baby sitter by phone, claiming to be the parent
of an 18 year old boy who had the mentality of a toddler, needed
to be changed and fed, and whose bad habits (Masturbating in
public) should be ignored.  When the sitter arrived, the giant

for the boy while he went out on his escapade.

then undressed, put duct tape over his eyes, and handcuffed
himself to her bed.  In the note were instructions that she was
to go into her bedroom immediately and have sex with him because

table, could not free himself before they arrived.

was found with the materials, along with pieces of paper,
discovered in videotape boxes, containing numbers which
corresponded to the VCR counter numbers at the which sex scenes

robbed a bank in 1987, he only got three to five years. 
Secondly, he said, citing an article from the Brockston
Enterprise newspaper, the bank had enjoyed record earnings
despite the robbery and expected to do well in 1992 also.  Said
Damon, "I didn't hurt this bank at all."  When the judge asked
Damon if he would rob banks again if he were free, Damon replied,
"I'd like to plead the Fifth Amendment on that."  The judge

In this Article, i will instruct you on building a pipe bomb with no 
fire or gun powder.

Materials:
12 inch pipe(metal or plastic) with lids on both ends (1)
GLASS baby food jar (1)
1 cup of baking soda (1)
1 cup of vinegar (1)
rocks,glass,nails,etc (as much as you can fit)

Procedure:

1. Get the pipe.

2. Screw the lid on one(1) end TIGHTLY!!!!

3. Fill the pipe half way with the rocks,glass,nails,etc...

4. Pour the one(1) cup of baking soda into the pipe.

5. Pour the one(1) cup of vinegar into the GLASS baby food jar. CAP 
MOTHERFUCKING TIGHTLY!

6. CAREFULLY FUCKING CAREFULLY slide the capped jar into the pipe 
CAREFULLY!!!

7. TIGHTLY screw the lid on to the pipe, FUCKING TIGHT AS HELL!!

How to set it off:

1. Hit the pipe on the ground as hard as you can to break the baby 
food jar.

2. Set the pipe where you want it to explode.

3. Run away from the bomb, you have about five(5) minutes.

Explanation of how it works:

1. When the glass of the baby food jar breaks from the impact, the 
vinegar is released into the
   pipe, and the chemical reaction of the baking soda and the 
vinegar will eventually provide 
   enough pressure to make the pipe explode.


NOTE: 
Take extreme caution where it says "CAREFULLY" or you might lose a 
hand.
The writer of this article takes no responsibility on how you use 
it, or the consequences 
of your actions before or after obtaining this information!

Are jOO 4 k-rad hAx0r ? tired of 
getting kicked from channels for using 
mirc, well,
pheer no more, as you can impress all 
your friends, and finally get a life by 
changing
the mirc version reply by using this 
patent pending techniq.

*1* Copy mIRC.exe to b0g.exe

*2* Open b0g.exe in MS-DOS Edit 
(edit.com /070 c:\mirc\b0g.exe)

*3* Search for the string "VERSION" and 
replace it with "b0gowns" 
(or any 7 letter string, that isnt 
a normal ctcp request)

*4* Open a New file in Notepad, and 
paste the following
--- from here ---
ctcp *:version:*: {
if ($chan != $null) {echo -a _4,0[ 
$+ $nick VERSION: $+ $chan $+ ] } 
{else echo -a _4,0[ $+ $nick VERSION 
$+ ] }
.ctcpreply $nick VERSION  BitchX-
1.0c10+  by panasync - FreeBSD 3.4-
STABLE :  Keep it to yourself! 
halt
} ; ph33r my mirc skills
--- to here ---
Save this as b0g.mrc in the mirc 
directory

*5* Run b0g.exe, and type /load -rs 
b0g.mrc
now connect joo fool , and test 
that this works


Now you can finally idle with pride, 
as people think your not on windows, 
unless they use nmap.

Women's Rights

In 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst set up a new society
called The Women's Social and Political Union. It
believed in action not words, and in demonstrations
and attacking property in protest against the lack of
women's rights. 

These suffragettes, or Lesbians, were often arrested
and put in jail ... I bet they had a field day! 

In 1913 one of the more mental bean flickers threw
herself under the Kings horse at the Derby.. with
catastrophic results. It brought him down, and
Lucky Jim romped it at 14 to 1. The Lezza died...
probably of shock..... first time she'd ever been
jumped. 

Anyway, they helped us out in the war, so in 1918
we gave them the vote. This didn't just benefit
baggage handlers... no.... thanks to these early
"women", normal girls can now pop along to the
polling station after shopping... or picking the kids
up from school, and put a tick next to their favorite
lady politician.

Of course, nowadays, there are muff bandits in all
walks of life. They're still usually right biffers, like
KD Lang or Ellen... but now and again a real babe
turns fishmonger... and that's a waste.


                  Freud

Sigmund Freud is regarded by most as the father of
psychoanalysis. He held that repression of infantile
sexuality would lead to adult neurosis. And that this
neurosis would manifest themselves in the dream
like state. 

We've all got theories though haven't we. I mean, I say
never trust a man who doesn't drink... not even
reformed alcoholics... you can always have a couple
every day, can't you? 

You see that's a theory. It's as valid as beardy
bollocks and his .... All that dreams about sex. He
was hung up on sex. 

I have this dream right. I'm driving a tube train in and
out of a tunnel... and I'm going fast because I'm
panicked. Because my nan's on board.. and she's
giving birth... to my girlfriend... actually. 

And my dad, who's the station master, is really
angry with me and he's trying to stop the train ...
with a flag.... It's not a flag.. it's like a big salami. And
he's going to punish me. 

And I get really nervous... and I spill my milk.... All
over the place. 

I suppose Freud would read something into that.... Pervert.


A coon is having a piss in a public toilet, he finishes his piss and 
starts to
shake the drops off, suddenly his bellend falls off in the urinal. 
He gives a cry of
alarm, grabs his bellend, puts it in his pocket and runs to the 
nearest doctors.
"Doctor..you've got to fucking help me!" he shouts showing him his 
cock. "Where's
your fucking bellend?" says the doctor. "It's in my fucking pocket 
Doc..! do
something for fucks sake!!". 

"Don't worry mate ..get your fucking blackass on the bus and get 
down to the
hospital...I'll ring my mate there who is the head surgeon..he'll 
sort you out!!" says
the doctor. 

So the coon goes to the hospital where he finds the head surgeon. 
"Help me please
for fucks sake..!" he says showing him his bellendless cock. "No 
problem mate...soon
have you fixed up" says the surgeon.."Now then where's your 
bellend?" 

The coon reaches in his pocket and gives him the bellend. 

"You taking the fucking piss?" says the surgeon. 

"Why what do you mean?" says the coon. 

"This isn't a fucking bellend...you've given me a fucking walnut 
whip!" says the surgeon. 

"It can't be .." says the coon.." I ate that on the bus on the way 
here!!!"
(A bellend is the tip of your cock you dosey cunts)

Are you lame?
Do people pick on you?
Are you a stupid motherfucker with no life that is the ideal icon 
for the picture of a "loser?"

if your name is RLoxley, yes, otherwise, no one is.

BUT
RLoxley is not what this is about, its about world domination!

First, you need money, lots of it! go rob a bank, if someone tries 
to stop you, use your h4x0r like skillz, and ninja kick them through 
a window, saying "rooted!" now you run really really fast, and go 
home. When you get home you count the money, and exchange it for 
UNMARKED PENNYS, make sure they are real. Now go buy allot of guns, 
and allot of people(ask prae where he buys his "people") and go kill 
allot of people, just randomly. When the cops come, kill them, the 
fbi will come, kill them, soon the national guard will come, kill 
them, and when they all die, YELL REALLY LOUD "rooted!" Now is time 
to get the people(you didnt kill) to listen to you. Tell them that 
if they make you their mastert, you will not kill them, and if they 
refuse, you will kill them. NOW WHAT TO DO IF ANYONE REFUSES! kill 
them! and if they do make you their master, kill them anyways, just 
to get the point across.

Now that you 0wn everyone, tell the men to make you dinner, and the  
women to make you a castle so you can sit at the top, and throw shit 
at them, if they refuse...kill them! If you get raided by karate 
chop ninjas, and there are like 500,000,000,000,000,000 of them, and 
you CANT KILL THEM! what should you do? kill them? If RLoxley comes 
up to you and says 
"hEy MaN g0Tz N-E 0=d4Y wArEz???" DONT KILL HIM, for killing someone 
because they are a complete retard is not cool, so ask him "wheres 
my dinner?!?!?!?" and if he repys "I dont gn0" kill him if he 
doesnt, KILL HIM! for you are not killing him cause hes a lunatic 
retard, your killing him cause hes a dumbshit motherfucker. 

Now you all are gonna try this as you read it, and there cant be 500 
b0g masters, so I didnt include my neet-0 exploit how to overpower 
an existing ruler, that will be in next issue, until them send me a 
buncha junk email about how you killed people! txaxk@yahoo.com[I 
check it, but its not my #1 email, just because RLoxley finds it 
funny to use his AOL Em-b0Mb PuNtErS and Fl0oD m3]

NOW! go to their house at night, and make a big puddle of gas

Now, while your running, your a ninja anyways, so why the 
fuck not throw a brick through the car windows..it doesnt take
any effort, just do it while running by, they will freak....

Wait a little while..couple days, then cut their power!, then own
their phone box, chop! they are rooted, and they will wake up late 
for work...NO ALARM CLOCK! and they hop in the shower, and
NO HOT WATER, no power@$%

When they finally get up, and out be sure to make it hard to get 
in their car, put some of that liquid steal crap in their keyhole, 
they
will have to fix it, and then when they thinks alls ok, they wont be
able to see! remember the brick!.... When they back up out of the 
drive way, be sure to make sure the tires pop..a few innexpensive
nails leened up against the tires will work#

NOW get like 50 friends, and at night, all be quiet, and throw like

 ____________________________________________________________________



its a self descriptive langauge really. it does fuck your brain up.

it was designed to be a turing complete language with the smallest 
possible compiler. Brainfuck was created by a weird german guy, 
called Urban Mueller. Originally for the amiga, it has graced other 
platforms too.

brainfuck is a minimalist langauge, it has 8 commands. these 
commands
work on a char array, and a counter.

 Cmd  Effect                                 Equivalent in C
 ---  ------                                 ---------------
 +    Increases element under pointer        array[p]++;
 -    Decrases element under pointer         array[p]--;
 >    Increases pointer                      p++;
 <    Decreases pointer                      p--;
 [    Starts loop, counter under pointer     while(array[p]) {
 ]    Indicates end of loop                  }
 .    Outputs ASCII code under pointer       putchar(array[p]);
 ,    Reads char and stores ASCII under ptr  array[p]=getchar();

if you're wondering what turing complete is, it means that it can 
solve
any solvable mathematical problem.(I hope). Someone has written a 
primes
program, two people have written quines in brainfuck. a quine is a 
program
that prints its source code. But this is not comparable to the guy 
who has
written a brainfuck interpreter in brainfuck. 
see:http://home.wxs.nl/~faase009/

trying to write programs in brainfuck will really screw with your 
brain.

after seeing lines of code that are
++++++++++[>++++++++++++>++++++++++<<-]>----.>+.+.<++++.
                                     you get a small headache.
                                     
but when you get bored you end up producing stuff like this :
++++++++++[>+>+++>++++++++++>++++++++++++>++++++>++++++>+++++>
+++++++++<<<<<<<<-]>>++>----->++++>++>>--->++<<<<<<.>.....<...
>....<...>....<..>..<..>..<<.>>>.<.<...>.>.<<.>>.<<..>..>.<<.>
>.<<..>..>.<<.>>>>>>.<<<<<<.>>>>>>.<.<<<<<.>>>>>.<<<<<<.>..>>.
<<.>>.<<...>>.<<..>..>.<<.>>.<<..>..>.<<..>>>.<<<..>>>>.<<<<<.
>..>>.<.>.<<...>>.<....>.<<.>>.<.>.<<....>>>>>.<<<<.>>>>.>.<<<
<<.>>>>>.<<<<<<<.<
                  social life, what social life?
                  
Before you run off to write an interpreter, some other sad people 
have done
it for you.

I was told that this interpreter was written by mr brainfuck himself

char 
m[9999],*n[99],*r=m,*p=m+5000,**s=n,d,c;main(){for(read(0,r,4000);c=
*r;
r++)c-']'||(d>1||(r=*p?*s:(--s,r)),!d||d--),c-
'['||d++||(*++s=r),d||(*p+=c==
'+',*p-=c=='-',p+=c=='>',p-=c=='<',c-'.'||write(2,p,1),c-
','||read(2,p,1));}

so have fun, and watch those hours fly by as you try and debug 
brainfuck.

some other people have written compilers for brainfuck, however I 
have only seen it
for dos.

Like that ascii? Took me FOURTEEN HOURS of manual labor.
Anyway, in this article I plan to outline the methods of
writing an article for bog, or wasting time when youre
bored of doing homework.

First off you have to pick a topic no one has written
about. Denial of service is lame, and "the technical
aspects of plugging rj-45 into a hub" is for retards who
dont know what a computer is. For me, I like to cover a
wide variety of subjects. I like to do a technical one,
covering the deeper workings of stuff so retards can
learn how to press the "on" button on their computer. I
also like writing about stuff that makes it almost partly
seem like Im bragging about stuff, like the time I
heroicly raided the Ameritech base in Northfield. Those
articles are the most fun because retards learn that yes,
it doesnt take a brain surgeon to do brain surgery, just
a big whopping manual. That made no sense. Once you have
chosen your topic, you have to make up a bunch of "filler"
or what I call bullshit^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H information. Its
very important so people think you really know what youre
talking about.

Examples. If you write an article about stuff you do on
AOL, like chain letters, that shows how AMAZINGLY LEET
you are for using AOL and reading chain letters, then
taking the time to WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT. I have the
utmost respect for these people. If you write an article
about how you DOS'ed some website then got flamed for it,
that shows how bored you are and how desperate to write an
article you are. You must REALLY be desperate. Then, if you
write bragging articles about your lack^H^H^H^H abundance
of sex, you must be impotent. Obviously. Good examples are
writing articles that SEEM technical, like pager spoofing,
and turning it into something funny, like leaving a 900
number on their pager. Now if you write something that deals
with FOOLPROOF OR INTERNET CENSORSHIP PROGRAMS that means
you want us to know your parents lock your computer because
they caught you looking at gay porn. And NOT lesians. If you
take something from the anarchists cookbook, your are
obviously leet, because everyone loves a complete freak who
is hooked on dropping acid and snorting paint thinner. I
would love to meet such an amazing person, because DAMN they
are SOOOOO cool. Lastly, if your name is tak, you are a gimp
and should never write articles because anyone who actually
lets his sister put a dildo in his ass is a sick sick boy.

In conclusion, I just wasted ten minutes, as did you. Dont
you feel abused? Neglected? Hated? Go commit suicide. Yes,
pick up that knife and cut your wrist. DO IT FUCKER! Good,
now walk over to the kitchen, and pour salt on it. Now rub
it with butter. GOOD! Oh and tak I love you :P

<tak> dewd she stuck it all the way in my arse
<wh0rde> I own you
<tak> I know dewd, I know.

<k-rad-bob> man he stuck it in my arse
<wh0rde> you sick bastard!

Making a bomb that scares the shit out of people, but generally 
doesnt hurt anybody.

Materials #1 :
bottle of coke(1) must be plastic, size doesnt matter, and must have 
cap.
dry ice(enough to fill the bottle half way).
water(enough to fill the bottle the other half)

IF YOU CANT GET ANY DRY ICE:
baking soda(enough to fill the bottle half way)
vinegar(enough to fill the bottle half way)
no water

Procedure:
1. Screw the lid off of the bottle.

2. Check to see if it contains any coke, if so, drink it or pour it 
out, if not, go to 3.

3. Place the dry ice, or baking soda into the bottle until it is 
half way full.

4. Pour the water or the vinegar into the bottle until it reaches 
the top, by this time, you
   should notice some type of chemical reaction taking place.

5. Screw the cap on as TIGHT as you possibly can.

6. Set the coke bottle full of stuff down, and walk away.

Explanation:
The dry ice mixing with that water releases steam, and the pressure 
of the steam is so great
that it can make the bottle explode after a few minutes.

The vinegar and baking soda releases some type of gas that builds up 
the pressure in the bottle
and the pressure gets so great that the bottle explodes after a few 
minutes.

Note:
the bigger the bottle, the bigger the boom
if you blow your hand off, its not my fault

  - some useful links



GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

First of I start with this: DoS and DDoS attacks are (mostly) used 
by script kiddies. Probably they tried to hack a single webserver or a 
whole network but failed and are so pissed they "nuke" the system. 
(yes, for those who didn't know, nuking is also a DoS attack)

Every computer which stops working normally because of extern cases, 
is the victim of a Denial Of Service attack. Like I said, most ppl 
know this of the Winnukes somewhere in 1997 to crash a win95 machine. 
With a nuke program you could send an "OutOfBand"-packet to the open 
port 139, which crashed the system. Newer version of windows haven't 
this 'flow'. Winnuke is a typical DoS attack because it creates a 
buffer overrun which takes the whole system down.

There are a lot of programs to realize a DoS-attack, thinking of 
Teardrop, Land, Bonk, Snork or Smurf. But these attacks became 'old' 
because most systemoperators have patched that flow so 
the webserver has kind of a protection against these attacks.

Attackers which uses these kind of attacks belong to the group of 
script-kiddies. Most of the time this boys just download programs from 
hacking-groups and use them to annoy other internet users (or network 
users)

A whole other thing is a DDoS attack (Distributed Denial Of 
Service). With an attack of this form the target computers gets 
multiple attacks from different computers (servers). With this 
kind of attack you can take down major systems like Yahoo, eBay and 
Amazon.com

To arrange such an attack you have to become root on the other 
attacking systems to install the backdoor trojan. Therefor you are 
required to know the basics of real hacking. To attack major systems 
like listed above, you need a lot of knowledge and have to work with 
other hackers as well. This isn't the layer of script-kiddies anymore.

There exist some 'secret' (=not anymore now) batch-files which helps 
hackergroups to take control over a lot of systems at a time. But 
nobody outside the hardcore hackculture has found such a tool. 
(contact me if you have it)

The four most popular tools for DDoS are Trin00, Tribe Flood Network 
(TFN), Tribe Flood Network2000 (TFN2K) and Stacheldraht.

Trin00 exists since the summer of 1999 and can be used from a single 
computer through a masterprogram (=handler) which controls all the 
other programs (daemons) on the attacking servers. You can use a SYN-
flood which has a max use time of 33 mins. Trin00 uses TCP and 
UDP and has variable ports.

In TribeFlood Net (also since summer of 1999) the masterprogram 
(client) communicates with the flooders (=agents) through ICMP 
(Internet Control Message Protocol, known from ping)
The size of the ICMP packets decides which kind of attack was 
executed. Next to several SYN-floods TFN also supports UDP, ICMP 
floods and smurf-attacks.

TFN2K has more features then his predecessor. One of those is that 
it encrypts its commands and runs also on winNT (next to Solaris and 
linux). But TFN and TFN2K has one advantage and that's why they are 
more popular then Trin00, they spoof the IP's of the attacking servers 
including the masterserver (which sends to command, so it's you) and 
makes the attack hard to stop and trace you.

Stacheldraht combines the most important features of TFN and Trin00. 
It can execute all the listed attacks, it encrypts the commands and 
isn't hooked up to a certain port. The program also checks if the 
server of the victim is running an 'old' DDoS IP filter, if so it 
checks if there is a way to bypass that filter. Stacheldraht also uses 
a three layer method, server / client / agentarchitecture which makes 
it impossible to trace the original commander of the attack. TFN, 
TFN2K and Stacheldraht are probably created by a German hacker called
'Mixter'. The FBI is chasing him down since February when the 
attacks begun on Amazon, Yahoo!, eBay and the FBI. (I think his arrest 
won't stop the DDoS hype because the source code is available and this 
way the programs will only get new features) -> 
not that I think it's bad .heh

The recent DDoS attacks were all done with Stacheldraht. In that 
three layer attack a hacker sends from his computer the command for 
the attack to all the client machines. Every client has a list with IP 
addresses of the servers where the agent is running. On their turn, 
the client servers send over an encrypted way the command to the 
agents which execute the attack and take the system down.

The most used type is a SYN-flood. In this case the victim's server 
was attacked by the SYN request (synchronize) on port 80 (http). Such 
a request is a part of a standard connection.
Your browsers sends the SYN request to the server and waits till the 
server requests with SYN.

The browser reacts with ACK (acknowledge) and then the transfer of a 
webpage starts. With a SYN-flood the server reacts just like always 
but the agent uses a spoofed (or fake) IP address which commits a 
packet loss. The server waits a few seconds but won't get a ACK 
reply. At that very little moment is the serverproces (called 
thread) which waits on the ACK reply not available for other visitors 
to the site.

During a DDoS attack many Stacheldraht agents send in a fast way a 
lot of SYN requests to the server. So in a few seconds all the threads 
of the server are used and the server is not reachable for other users 
anymore. When the server still gets some free threads, they are 
immediately taken by another SYN request from one of the agents. 
Because of all the requests and the spoofed IP's, most sysadmins won't 
have time enough to block all the IPaddresses and the system won't be 
reachable for some hours (maybe days). UDP and ICMP floods
are done also that way but are easier to block and not so popular.


A DDoS OVERVIEW
===============

The first (big) victim of DDoS was IDsoftware on january 7. They had 
a lot of attacks on there quake III keyservers. The q3 'freaks' 
weren't able to play online for twelve hours. After that
attacks were noticed on CNN.com, Ebay.com, Yahoo.com, Etrade.com, 
Amazon.com and Buy.com (this last site got a 800Mbit datatraffic every 
second!) The co-ordinated attack took down those sites for about three 
hours. Next day ZDnet.com was taken down for 2 hours. and on february 
25 the FBI site was down for a whole day. The only real threat comes 
from windows-users who have the Trin00 trojan installed. This program 
came also on win9x,NT,2000. It works on port 34555 using the TCP 
protocol. Somebody who has this trojan installed and has for example 
an ADSL connection is able to participate a DDoS attack without 
knowing it, with the danger that your IP isn't masked. (only TFN,TFN2K 
and Stacheldraht spoofs your IP)

flavors of unix, most windows systems, and Macintosh. Next question.

I hate closing this thing up.
Moslty because my eyes are dancing in my skull from all this editing.
Why the fuck cant you gimps format the text properly?
Its enought to make you throw yourself out the nearest window.

The mailbag which was supposed to be a monthly thing is not here in 
this issue, simply because we dont get that much funny mail :(

Cept this one:

Well...
Point being...
I'm tired and I cant wait to make this issue official!

So here goes nothing, to hell with all spelling errors and badly 
formatted text.


As usual you can get your copies of b0g at http://www.b0g.org
If our site its down its probably because grid has been nuking it and 
in that case jump over to http://packetstorm.securify.com/mag/b0g/

Next issue will have contents in it! You can win stuff!
H0H0!

So...
Thanks and uNFs goes out to:

packetstorm, space rouge, kym, uneek, space rouge, noose and the rest

0d4y j0k3:



This guy just started at his new job, working at a porno shop.  His boss 
comes
out and tell him that he has to leave for a while, and "can you handle it?"
The new employee is somewhat reluctant, but with the boss's positive 
comments
he finally agrees.

So, the guy is there by himself for a little while and a white woman comes 
in.
She asks, "How much for the white dildo?"
He answers, "$35."
She:  "How much for the black one?"
He:   "$35 for the black one, $35 for the white one."
She:  "I think I'll take the black one.  I've never had a black one 
before."
She pays him, and off she goes.

A little bit later a black woman comes in and asks "How much for the black
dildo?"
He:  "$35."
She: "How much for the white one?"
He:  "$35 for the white one, $35 for the black one."
She: "Hmmm...I think I'll take the white one.  I've never had a white one
      before..."
She pays him, and off she goes.

About an hour later a young blonde woman comes in and asks, "How much are
your dildos?"
He:  "$35 for the white, $35 for the black."
She: "Hmmmmm....how much is that plaid one on the shelf?"
He:  "Well, that's a very special dildo...it'll cost you $165."
She thinks for a moment and answers, "I'll take the plaid one, I've never
     had a plaid one before...."
She pays him, and off she goes.

Finally, the guy's boss returns and asks, "How did you do while I was 
gone?"
To which the saleman responded, "I did really good, I sold one white dildo,
one black dildo, and I sold your thermos for $165!"
