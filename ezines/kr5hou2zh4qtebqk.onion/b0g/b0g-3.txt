Hi my name is obsolete and I'm suffering from extreme guilt from not 
forwarding 50 million fucking chain letters sent to me by people who 
actually believe that if you send them on then a poor little Ethiopian 
girl with a 
vagina on her forehead will receive enough money to have it removed 
before her parents 
sell her to the plantation owners.
I mean can you believe the stupidity behind this shit, like AOL is 
gonna give you a hundred dollars if you send an email to everyone on 
your list. BULLSHIT! 
Oh wait I better scroll down and make a wish so I can get laid by 
every model on the face of the earth. 
So basically all I'm saying is FUCK YOU to all the losers that have 
nothing better to do than forward gay ass emails about stupid faggots 
in Botswana with no arms and no legs that need you to forward this so 
they can get a miracle transplant. 
Wait if I don't send it maybe the little chain-mail fairies will come 
in and sodomize me in my sleep, or kill me by anal electrocution, for 
not sending on an email that was started in 21 BC by Jesus, YES 
JESUS!! 
And if I send it, and it continues it will be in the Guinness Book of 
World Records for the lamest thing ever done on a computer or with e-
mail for that matter. 
Do people actually look at these things or what........I mean FUCK! 
Look at what your sending out and have some type of fucking 
intelligence people. Chances are your just stupid to realize what the 
hell you are sending out!


Now lets go through the 4 basic types of chain letters:


Chain Letter #1:

Hello and thanks for reading this letter. The reason I am sending this 
is because you see there's this little boy in Zimbabwe who has no arms 
and no legs, and his parents left him at birth. The sad part about it 
is that his parents left him in a herd of goats and he gets ass
raped 10-12 times a day. But you can help this boy fight off these 
madly horny goats by forwarding this chain letter to 94,456 people in 
the next 32 seconds, he will get 1 cent donated by the Zimbabwean 
Armless Legless Ass Raped Fund for every person that receives this 
letter. So send it fast.


Chain Letter #2:
(scroll down)





















make a wish!
























go ahead!
























not that you hornball!

























finger getting tired yet?


































ok STOP!!@#!@#$ 

Man wasn't that fun, I hope you made a great wish because now you must 
send this to 1,350 people in the next 56 seconds to make it come true. 
But if you don't you will be hunted down by mad sheep and get 
assfucked like a young schoolboy, and rabid donkeys will make you
eat their asshole out while they play checkers. So send it now. Its 
true! Not like all of those other fake ones!#@#$ This one is 
TRUE!@#~!$

Here's how it is:
*1-2 people = At least 2 of your friends will be pissed off at you for 
sending them shit.

*3-5 people = At least 5 of your friends will be pissed off at you for 
sending them shit and will e-mail you a response.

*5-10 people = At least 10 of your friends will be pissed off at you 
for sending them shit and may
form a plot against your life.

*10-20 people = Everyone will be pissed off at you and they will throw 
draino bombs at your house,
and may form a plot on your life.

Chain Letter #3: 

Hey there everyone! You are extremely lucky because this chain letter 
that you have just received has been in existence since 1886. (This is 
absofuckinglutely infuckingcredible because e-mail wasn't even
around then and I'm sure there wasn't this many loser ass bitches 
around to send this shit out.) If you continue this chain letter, and 
it continues to the year 2000 then it will make into The Guiness Book 
of World Records.

Here's what you have to do:
Forward this to 10,906 people in the next 4 minutes or this could 
happen to you:

*Bizarre Horror Story #1*
K-Rad-Bob was walking home from school one day by the ocean. He had 
received this letter but ignored it. Next thing he knew he was tackled 
from behind and thrown aboard a ship full of Russian sailors. He was 
ass raped by them all and later died by bleeding to death because 
his sphincter muscle was torn into 600 pieces. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO 
YOU!@#$!@

*Bizarre Horror Story #2*
One day Prae was driving in his car with his boyfriend (some people 
swing that way). He had received this letter earlier that day and 
deleted it like any other chain letter. While in his car, he and his 
boyfriend were struck by a farm truck carrying rabid goats. Normally 
Prae would have been happy except these goats had been genetically 
altered and they had twelve inch cocks. 
Prae tried to run but the goats got to him first and ripped his virgin 
asshole open like knife through hot butter. He then died after one of 
the goats poked his dick in Prae's mouth, and in 
self defense, Prae bit down and bit the goats dick right off. But when 
one of the goats slammed its dick into Prae's ass he accidentally 
swallowed it and choked to death. THIS IS A TRUE STORY!@#$

So you better send this on or you could end up like Bob and Prae. 


Chain Letter #4:

A friend is someone who always loves you,
Even if you smell like catfood and your breath reeks of shit.
A friend is someone who pretends to like you even if they think you 
should be shot in the face and eaten by cannibals.
A friend is someone who likes you even if your ugly as a dogs asshole,
A friend is someone who stays the night with you so you can cry about 
your sad, sad life.
A friend is someone who would never forward a chain letter to a 
worthless piece of dog shit like you.
A friend is someone who scrubs the toilet, vacuums, doesn't speak much 
English, and gets the check and leaves.....no wait that's the cleaning 
lady.

Now pass this on or you will never ever have sex again......the point 
being??? Half of you people that forward these chain letters get no 
sex anyway...so what does it really matter???

What I'm trying to say is don't pass on stupid shit like this......if 
its funny send it on...
make someone's day....but don't threaten them that they will have bad 
luck or that they will
let the 91 year old man in Calicut with no teeth that's tied to a dead 
zebra will die if they don't send it on so he can get his 5 cents per 
email.

Just realize what your doing when you send someone some stupid crap 
about nothing...

What the hell. abb0t, obviously a crackmonkey, msged me today and said
"phreaking is lame." I said "YKNOW WHUT HAXOR BRO YEH U R KEWL MY 
FRIEND." I told him off good didn't I. Anyway the point of the story 
is that phreaking, or what I like to call f0n3 h4x0r1ng, which is a 
much more 3l337 way of putting it. These are the basics you need to 
f0n3 h4x0r:

1) Screwdriver
2) Bolt cutters (optional)
3) A half of a brain

Ok step one. Find your local telco. Go there at any time past 12 
(midnight) and walk up to the back of a telco truck. Test the back 
door (or side door, depending on how poor your town is) and see if its 
open. If not whip out your handy bolt cutters, and snip that big fat 
padlock off. If there's a digital keypad, like the newer trucks rarely 
have, simply slam the bolt cutters against it repeatedly until 
something snaps, then break open the window (just to make sure they 
never make the mistake of using a keypad).
Now GRAB LOOT! Each of those strange boxes is about 600$ worth of 
equipment.
Most of the stuff is like voltage testers n crap, but you might find 
some *REALLY* good stuff, like this large metal box soldered down in 
between the driver and shotgun seat (shotgun is next to driver seat 
for you idiots in Texas, telcos don't have shotguns mounted on seats). 
It is leet.

Quote:
This thing is called TeleTech. It is a terminal about the size of a
mini-laptop, but without the screen. It has a screen, with a brown
background and displays black text. One thing that you can tell it by 
are all the colored keys on it that let the tech make specific 
choices. 

TeleTech
runs on an OS called ITRON Custom Operating System (COS). The tech 
hooks his cell phone up to the back of the terminal and dials one of 
the AP system numbers. Once connected to the system, they enter the 
phone number on which they need line info. They have a portable 
printer that they send the info to. Cable and Pair numbers, work 
orders, how many lines are on the account.

End Quote.
That fucker will get you anything. To use! Turn it on, at the password
prompt hold down shift and make six hyphens (-) and hit enter. Write 
down that password, and use it. Mind you I have never seen one in 
Illinois, I think they're only in NJ, so that's all I can tell you 
from reet infos.
Anyway, grab at least one lineman's handset, that's the thing looking 
like a phone, and some other crap to sell or use (depending on what 
your hobbies are). I cannot reiterate this next point ANY more. Take 
that padlock WITH you, don't leave it there. Look around, grab 
ANYTHING you dropped, if you leave a bolt cutters lying in the middle 
of a van IT IS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.
Close the door, lock up, and if you can make sure that the van door 
cant be opened, by this I mean locking it. Wedging your bolt cutters 
in there is not cool. The effect you want to make is that the worker 
is a lazy slob who didn't lock up and some robber jacked his tools, or 
he's keeping them or something. Now, j00tilize your new toys. The 
handset is great for long distance calls to friends, but make sure the 
calls don't tie in with your IMMEDIATE FAMILY OR FRIENDS. This is also 
suspicious. Uhm.. yeah, have fun, don't be safe, and kick ass. One 
last thing, if you feel pissed off because your girlfriend broke up 
with you cuz your too much of a geek, you may do the following:

1) Find telco can
2) Open door, via lid or bolt cutters
3) Whip out Mr. Baseball bat.
4) Bash the connectors to where they go IN the can, this may produce
electric sparks that maim you, but continue to bash it until you hear 
sirens
and/or neighbors screaming. Repeat if necessary.

This is about how a group of people (around 20) threatened to hack 
packet and kill me, why you may ask, well here's a look at the story

someone dos'd www.virusexchange.org offline and then deleted all the 
files on their box, who was this.... everyone says me... yet they have 
no evidence. Here are some interviews regarding it.


Evul (1 of the top guys in #virus)

Email to my webhost who hosts my webpage (duh)

The email:

you are hosting a loser wanna-be hacker at 
http://rapture.warfactory.com
who has been attacking our servers... His last attack took down a 
commercial network that was hosting http://www.virusexchange.org .. 
which the feds are monitoring anyway - and we have *every intention* 
of returning the favor to him.  Thing is , his site is hosted here .. 
Do you guys REALLY wanna gettangled up in this ?

I am the owner of one of these servers, and I *DO* have every 
intention of keeping this loser off the web - one way or another.  I 
guarrantee that the law is going to be brought into this matter, also 
.. so you are warned about
what comes with rapture.

My reply ( I got the email from my webhost)

Hi Ryan/Evul/ViRuShackErz/CoDeRz/WarKoDeRZ,

What's this "our servers" thing you're talking about?  The servers 
that are provided
by BrustNET, that all resolve to one IP, or the individual pages of 
your "members"?

In your statement "His last attack took down a commercial that was 
hosting 
http://www.virusexchange.org" ...have you ever thought of this before?  
Have you ever
taken the time and read through the Internic/NSI acceptable user 
policy and the "rules"?
.ORG IS NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION (notice the "non-profit) there.  So, 
the only other
possibility that you meant with "commercial network" would be 
burst.net, which would
be impossible to take down, since it is backed by 4 MCI backbones and 
2 Qwest pipes.

By the way, does BurstNET know that you (or whoever) is hosting and 
distributing/encouraging
illegal, and destructive software (virus software) on their network?  
And does BC Tel Advanced 
Communications know that you are hosting a gaming site off your ADSL?

Speaking of the feds...you should know that I live in the United 
Kingdom, and therefore unless
I committed a crime here, I'm not guilty of anything.  Besides, where 
is your proof?  How do you
know that it was REALLY me?  

John       1/28/89  9:45 PM  he attacked a network owned by a friend 
of
                             mine today .. its a commercial network, 
being
                             a high dollar business.

Yeah, and I'm sure the president cancelled his trip to china to call 
for an emergency meeting
at the white house with the nations top CEOs and the department of 
defense....

What's this big dollar business that I (supposedly) took down?  
Virusexchange.org wasn't a
business, it was a site full of "virus coders" that have nothing else 
productive to do that make
lame assembly programs that screw up the boot sector.  Besides that, 
it looked more like a
warez site, unprofessionally done and cheap looking.  You should e-
mail JP at Antionline
and tell him your story...because, he'll be the only one that will 
take you serious.

Have fun kids..keep on coding "coderz"

<Evul> what ?
<[rapture]> you have some
<Evul> vx.org was on a business network, for one
<Evul> and you cost shad good money
<Evul> yes, burst knows exactly what I do
<Evul> and they didn't host vx.org
<[rapture]> how much and what business did I hurt?
<Evul> shadseek owns a business
<Evul> he was kind enough to run vx.org on it for us
<Evul> and he doesn't have the multitude of bandwidth that burst does
<Evul> I;ve seen your packets at fusion ... 
<[rapture]> stop talking out of your retarded ass, like that gay sitw 
was so ompirtant
<[rapture]> stop making up so much shit
<Evul> it wasn't to me...
<[rapture]>  why this "high dollar business" is hosted off a T1
<[rapture]> line
<Evul> and I am not
<Evul> its not a high-dollar business
<[rapture]> .coderz.net is hosted off BurstNET
<Evul> its enuff to put food on shad's table
<Evul> and you comprimised that
<Evul> THAT is the part that pissed me off .. 
<Evul> sites come and go
<Evul> I've already moved coderz six times
<Evul> that's nothign
<Evul> its what your packeting did to shad
<[rapture]> if its not a high dollor business
<[rapture]> whats the fuzz about I took down a comercial network?>
<Evul> *I* said "business network"
<Evul> and that's what it is
<[rapture]> what proof do you have it was me?
<Evul> between me and you .. 
<Evul> I know it was you
<Evul> I am not trying to take action, so I don't need to prove it
<Evul> I am not trying to
<Evul> but, that was one fucked up thing to do, man
<[rapture]> the email said you were going to
<Evul> I am not
<[rapture]> infact it promised
<[rapture]> id be ofline 1 way or another
<Evul> do you wanna let thisd thing die, or is it going to continue ?
<Evul> its up to you, man
<[rapture]> why are you hosting a site with destructive software
<Evul> look around
<Evul> you are assuming there is
<[rapture]> hahha, you promised the world id be dead or in jail !@!@
<[rapture]> now you want to drop it
<[rapture]> I SMELL PH34R
<Evul> I never said anything about dead
<Evul> no you don't, you smell boredom 
<Evul> tis bullshit, and I have enuff of that in my real life
<[rapture]> I just want you to answer my questions, first you
<[rapture]> accuse me of packeting your 'high dollar business 
networks'
<[rapture]> and now you're telling me to drop this
<Evul> no
<Evul> I am not telling you to
<Evul> I would rather the whiole thing never happened
<Evul> and yes, I will answer you
<[rapture]> you seem like a depressed child, would you like me to be 
your friend?
<[rapture]> why did the site get deleted, did someone hack it?
<Evul> not really, and I am a manic-depressive, thank you, and not a 
child
<Evul> dood
<Evul> the site got taken down by shad
<Evul> he cant have any of that bullshit interfering with his business
<Evul> and that's exactly what it was .. bullshit
<[rapture]> what happened to all the files that were there, they went 
their for like the last hour of it being up
<Evul> I don't know
<[rapture]>  do you suffer under compulsive anorexia phobia or
<[rapture]> canatonic schitzophrenia
<Evul> I don't know how you are resolving IP's .. but I have several 
IP's on that server
<Evul> nope
<Evul> I just get good moods/bad moods
<Evul> to the extreme
<Evul> why ?
<[rapture]>  several IPs resolving to the SAME box
<[rapture]> so this high business is actually 1 linux box
<Evul> nope
<Evul> you are getting virusexchange and coderz.net confused
<Evul> they are unrelated, physically
<[rapture]> does this mean mrsandman isnt going to come and beat me up 
now?
<Evul> dood ,I have no clue what anyone plans to do, otehr than myself
<[rapture]> coderz.net is hosted of BurstNET, and
<[rapture]> virusexchange.org is GONE haha
<Evul> do me a favor .. don't do that shit anymore
<Evul> I am moving coderz onto a co-location box on a mere t3
<[rapture]> so, basicaly your saying, that you promised to take me 
ofline and legal action would be taken
<[rapture]> and your doing none of this
<Evul> honestly .. I thought you were going to attack my site, too
<[rapture]> maybe all your fellow #virus d00ds log's and shit wernt 
such hard evidence, maybe you don't have a leg to stand on in a court 
of law
<Evul> maybe, maybe not
<Evul> maybe I don't fucking care?
<[rapture]> you know your coderz.net in insecure right
<Evul> ya .. it just got a new install of RH 6.1 and it needs some 
patches
<[rapture]> what made you think codrz.net was going to get "packeted" 
?
<Evul> because when you said something like "sorry virus-dood, your 
sites are going down"
<[rapture]> anyone with lame security deserves to be haxx'd
<Evul> or a weak upstream ?
<[rapture]> dpeends to wha end
<[rapture]> there is a motive beind every crime
<Evul> sure there is, no matter how solid, or lame
<[rapture]> you don't seem as fagish as the rest of the virus d00ds
<[rapture]> but your condcut with the bans and shit was just pure 
homosexuality
<Evul> hmm
<Evul> no ,.. you wether directly or indirectly caused the destruction 
of many people'ssites
<[rapture]> so your not sure, are you?
<Evul> I am just not getting into that argument with you
<[rapture]> you have no idea who did any of it, do you 
<Evul> I sure do
<[rapture]> ok, who ?
<Evul> u did the packeting
<[rapture]> based upon what evidence
<Evul> like I said, I don't need evidence ... I am not trying to prove 
a fucking thing
<[rapture]> what about 
<Evul> any of it
<[rapture]> inocent until proven guilty
<Evul> this isnt a court
<[rapture]> or am I just making this all up
<Evul> and I don't acre that much anyway
<[rapture]> you threatened, sorry promised to take legal action
<Evul> care, even
<Evul> I just thought you should get a taste of people taking your 
shit down , too ...
<[rapture]> the way I see it, the world is rid of a evil virus site, 
and the internet is better for it
<Evul> I talked to him personally about a temporary thing
<Evul> I knew it was coming back
<Evul> and so did your host
<[rapture]> he only did it because you threatened him
<[rapture]> which was a truly gay thing to do
<Evul> did he neglect to tell you what else I said ?
<[rapture]> I have the icq log and the email 
<Evul> I said "I just wanted to see something done "
<[rapture]> shall I quote ?
<Evul> if you can quote, you are reading what I am talking about, and 
no, I don't need a quote
<Evul> I have my logs, likewisw
<[rapture]> John       1/28/89  9:48 PM  I think you ahve more to 
worry about from
<[rapture]>                                   network attacks ..
<[rapture]> Ryan       1/28/89  9:48 PM  Did he rm -rf the server or 
what?
<[rapture]> John       1/28/89  9:48 PM  like steady SYN/UDP flooding 
and stuff
<Evul> I was suggesting repocussions that were being discussed in 
general ,, not from myself
<[rapture]> John       1/28/89  9:44 PM  by our doing ,, and I am sure 
that there are
<[rapture]>                                   plenty of users he has 
destroyed sites of
<[rapture]>                                   today,, that are ready 
to attack in return
<Evul> as you can clearly see from that discussion
<[rapture]> he came to me, scared that you and friends would do to him 
what was done to you
<[rapture]> yet, you have no clue who did it to you
<Evul> and you wanna talk about gaynes ?? DOSing a site is pretty 
lame, too 
<Evul> and you knwo it
<[rapture]> depends to what end's
<[rapture]> in general dosing is lame
<Evul> very
<[rapture]> its a weak attempt at showing off
<Evul> you think you are going to justify DOS by saying you removed a 
VX site ?
* Evul shakes his head
<[rapture]> who ever said I dos'd anything?
<Evul>  I could take that server coderz is on, and tear all kinda shit 
offline
<Evul> but I don't
<Evul> and from your email, you know I could
<[rapture]> what speed connection is it on?
<[rapture]> oh, you mean the network
<Evul> I get a steady running speed of 155 mbps
<Evul> will burst to OC-12
<Evul> 768
<Evul> I meant that box's line
<Evul> its fucking hot
<[rapture]> yeah, you could " tear all kinda shit offline"
<[rapture]> however, if anyone haxx'd your server
<[rapture]> which ANYONE could
<Evul> but ,, see .. I don't, and I don't think its right for someone 
else to try and abuse access to such machines
<[rapture]> they would have that pakcet power
<[rapture]> if your box is insecure, its asking for trouble
<Evul> true
<[rapture]> you KNOW its insecure, yet you do nothing
<[rapture]> are you unable to secure it?
<Evul> ya ya ..,. its getting fixed 
<[rapture]> do you need some help?
<Evul> its not here.. the techs are putting patches in it today and 
tomorrow
<[rapture]> if someone hacked your box and packeted another netwokr 
ofline
<Evul> there are several boxes that need patches
<[rapture]> whos fault is it?
<Evul> the ISP's 
<Evul> not mine
<[rapture]> then your saying, the network that packeted xe.org ofline
<[rapture]> are to blame
<[rapture]> yet you blame me
<Evul> actually, I would blame the intruder, and the ISP
<[rapture]> what logic is that?
<[rapture]> did you blame the network?
<Evul> the ISP for negligence, 
<[rapture]> did you threaten them?
<Evul> and the intruder for the attack
<Evul> I don't know where you packeted from
<Evul> Shad has those logs
<Evul> but ya
<Evul> I did last time
<[rapture]> did you email their webmaster telling him to take down the 
pages because the fbi would be investiagting them
<[rapture]> ?
<[rapture]> <Evul> I don't know where you packeted from
<Evul> I went stupid on the ISP that didn't secure their boxes when 
people were getting dos'd from a webserver some months ago
<[rapture]> "YOU" < you blame me yet again
<Evul> "YOU" already admitted it to me
<[rapture]> show me the log
<Evul> but this discussion ends here, anyway
<[rapture]> show me the evidence?
<[rapture]> wait, you have none !@!
<Evul> sur 8sigh8
<[rapture]> you forgot your shift key
<Evul> if I wanted to prove anything I would save the logs
<Evul> I don't
<Evul> how many fucking times do I have to say that >
<[rapture]> I'm going to
<[rapture]> because the world need to know
<[rapture]> all logs threats emails and such
<Evul> hmm ?
<[rapture]> will all be archived
<[rapture]> and setup online, for the world to see
<[rapture]> because they DESERVE to know
<Evul> very good, then *IF* and when someone does somethign it will be 
easier to figure out who it was
<Evul> once again, I don't care
<[rapture]> you best hope the hacker in question dosent see them, and 
take it the wrong way
<Evul> =]
<[rapture]> patch your box's, they need it
<Evul> and I have said .. I already knwo this
<[rapture]> else this hacker
<[rapture]> may choose your network next?
<Evul> care to share what you found ?>
<[rapture]> and remove the #virus ban's on me please
<Evul>  I have the Net-admin on the line right now
<[rapture]> if you want to know the insecurities, I can inform you, 
however not in this chat, as this log will be online
<[rapture]> and I'm sure the world dosnet wish to know how to "haxx" 
you
<Evul> send it over the submit form
<Evul> on coderz .. or however you mailed me already
<[rapture]> how about, unban me from virus and talk ther
<[rapture]> e
<Evul> I already did
<Evul> its outta my hands now
<Evul> the ban is higher than me
<[rapture]> 500 ban?
<Evul> I guess . I cant remove it
<[rapture]> unban all the ban's set on me and il get into the chan
<[rapture]> pass the word to virusbust maybe to unban ,e?
<[rapture]> me?
<Evul> he is same access as I
<Evul> no he is lower than I
<[rapture]> who owns the channel?

<Raid-> <Evul> HELL NO!
<[rapture]> ok
<Raid-> Seems you don't lie worth a fuck either.
<[rapture]> watch
<Raid-> script kiddie
<Raid-> you don't write your own apps
<Raid-> you "hack" existing holes or improperly setup software
<Raid-> and your not a script kiddie?
<[rapture]> <[rapture]> how about, unban me from virus and talk ther
<[rapture]> <[rapture]> e
<[rapture]> <Evul> I already did
<[rapture]> <Evul> its outta my hands now
<[rapture]> <Evul> the ban is higher than me
<[rapture]> <[rapture]> 500 ban?
<[rapture]> <Evul> I guess . I cant remove it
<Raid-> its a darkman level ban
<Raid-> I can get it reversed
<Raid-> if you can give me one good reason why I should?
<[rapture]> just to show I didn't lie
<[rapture]> raid, because I didn't haxx or packet anything
<[rapture]> check the logs
<[rapture]> they will clearly show it wasn't me
<Raid-> then, why did you come online and admit to messing with 
virusexchange?
<[rapture]> anyone could have used my name to say anything
<[rapture]> I personaly find it funny as fuck
<[rapture]> and now your going to shoot me
<Raid-> you find it funny as fuck that a site which supports the 
underground was messed with?
<[rapture]> no, that ive had multi death threats and legal actions 
threats
<Raid-> I said I might shoot you. If you turn out being some 14 year 
old kid, of course I won't shoot you...
<[rapture]> and like, none of it has happened
<[rapture]> its all talk
<[rapture]> I'm 18
<Raid-> You might not think it's all talk when one or more of the "vx" 
visit you.
<Raid-> You should be more careful who's sites you play with.
<Raid-> Some of those in this scene aren't just virus coders you know.
<[rapture]> are they crazy raged commandos with machine guns and alot 
of spare time?
<Raid-> PhreakX> HOE WILL EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE HOW TO DCC SEND A FUCKING 
LOG? <--- noted exception.
<Raid-> commando? nah, I'm just an American. :)
<[rapture]> well, raid I look foawrd to meeting you
<[rapture]> maybe your be a nice guy, if you read the logs
<Raid-> to be fair rap,
<Raid-> I'll check the logs out.
<Raid-> hell, you might actually be an honest fellow.
<[rapture]> il tell you what they say already 
<Raid-> but, I doubt it. ;p
<[rapture]> because when it was done, they showed the logs
<[rapture]> in #virus
<[rapture]> it showed packeting to be comming from .kr
<[rapture]> and the deleting of files, I'm not sure
<Raid-> hmmm
<[rapture]> that's why theirs no legal action
<[rapture]> else id be in jail by now
<Raid-> you had nothing whatsoever to do with the server being messed 
with?
<Raid-> jail for what? heh
<Raid-> DOSing a site?
<Raid-> neah
<[rapture]> Raid, youve threatened to kill me several times and so 
have others...with no evidence
<[rapture]> I find that funny as fuck
<[rapture]> raid read this
<[rapture]> The email:
<[rapture]> you are hosting a loser wanna-be hacker at 
http://rapture.warfactory.com
<[rapture]> who has been attacking our servers... His last attack took 
down a commercial
<[rapture]> network that was hosting http://www.virusexchange.org .. 
which the feds are
<[rapture]> monitoring anyway - and we have *every intention* of 
returning the favor to
<[rapture]> him.  Thing is , his site is hosted here .. Do you guys 
REALLY wanna get
<[rapture]> tangled up in this ?
<[rapture]> I am the owner of one of these servers, and I *DO* have 
every intention of
<[rapture]> keeping this loser off the web - one way or another.  I 
guarrantee that the
<[rapture]> law is going to be brought into this matter, also .. so 
you are warned about
<[rapture]> what comes with rapture.
<[rapture]> regards-
<[rapture]> John [aka Evul - MVT]
<[rapture]> Metaphase
<[rapture]> now, not only has no legal action been taken, none will 
be, and I'm online still arent I 
<Raid-> I've been online for years, even with the feds looking for me.
<Raid-> that doesn't mean anything.
<[rapture]> FBI = america
<[rapture]> me = isnt
<[rapture]> see
<Raid-> I apologize for threatening you.
<[rapture]> its all a bunch of shit
<[rapture]> if you want to come and shoot me
<[rapture]> your welcome to give it your best 
<[rapture]> motive: thinks he dosed a shite, but isnt shure
<[rapture]> shite = site
<Raid-> shrug
<Raid-> your correct, that doesn't justify my actions towards you.
<[rapture]> when you come to the uk, were meet up, and if you feel the 
need to beat me up your welcome to try
<[rapture]> I could have gone insane and threatened back, however I 
don't loose my cool
<Raid-> hehe
<[rapture]> I'm always aware of what I'm saying, and I know the law
<Raid-> I can't do that either man, Your just a kid.
<Raid-> If I go beating up a teenager or shooting one, I'll look 
really bad.
<[rapture]> I'm not going to report you, because I personaly don't 
want no troule
<[rapture]> and I'm legaly an adult
<Raid-> yes but your a teen
<[rapture]> and?
<Raid-> shrug
<Raid-> I'm 3-4 years older then you
<Raid-> to fight you or to go shooting at you wouldn't be good.
<[rapture]> ok
<Raid-> you should see the suckers on dalnet.
<Raid-> they are taking irok v1.1 like candy
<[rapture]> dalnet sucks
<Raid-> hehehe
<Raid-> it's useful for an itw virus.
<[rapture]> oh, cool
<[rapture]> anyhow, I'm going to make this all into a newsletter now
<[rapture]> bye

MrSadman aka M- ( like evul a top guy in the virus world )

m-> hello
<m-> what the hell happened to you, man????
<m-> I think we had already spoken about your behavior
<m-> you seemed to be ok
<Rapture> every vx'er on earth is after me
<m-> and now look what you did
<m-> what do you mean?
<Rapture> ewell#
<Rapture> when I poped on windows earilyer
<Rapture> like 10 people added me to icq
<Rapture> about that stuff
<m-> jesus christ... where's the fun, or the challenge, on doing such 
a lame thing? I mean, where was your satisfaction?
<Rapture> and I'm banned from everywhere
<m-> what the hell did you expect????
<m-> that guy who's hosting virusexchange.org depends on his server 
for earning his bread every month
<Rapture> due to legal reasons, no comment
<m-> no comment?
<m-> jesus christ, the less you should do is give an explanation
<m-> I can't believe it
<Rapture> if I saidanything
<Rapture> your log it and give it to the virus kiddies
<Rapture> and then I'm fucked
<m-> I won't say anything, I don't like this kind of games

<m-> I felt betrayed, you know?
<m-> I made my bet for you and I even opped you when everyone was 
against you in the channel
<m-> and now you've just proven I was wrong and everyone else was 
right
<m-> and you had to do it just with the site in which I had my 
homepage!!!

<Rapture> look
<m-> are you schitzo or what?
<Rapture> I'm not saying I did it
<m-> I know you did it
<Rapture> you know nothing....
<m-> i've read the logs in which you were "broadcasting" your 
"highlights"
<m-> what else do I need?
<Rapture> ok, paste them in here
<Rapture> I'm not going to jail over this
<m-> I don't have the logs here
<Rapture> look
<m-> but they were pasted in #virus
<Rapture> I don't trust you enough to tlak to you about this
<Rapture> my ebst friends have fucked me over
<Rapture> ive known lea- for like 2 years
<Rapture> and she fucked me over
<Rapture> knowdeth for 5 years
<Rapture> he fucked me over
<m-> ok, and? what does shadseek (vx.org's webmaster) to do with this? 
and what about those who had our websites being hosted there?
<Rapture> I'm not going to jai
<Rapture> l
<m-> why the fuck did you mix your personal affairs with us?
<Rapture> so this convo is over
<m-> I don't care about you going to jail or not
<m-> fuck jail, i'm trying to speak with you
<m-> and you keep all the time saying you won't go to jail
<m-> ok, good
<m-> I don't give a fuck about that
<Rapture> I don't trust you enough
<m-> you don't trust me enough for what?
<Rapture> to talk to you
<Rapture> since the logs will be sent to #virus
<m-> we're talking now
<m-> my conversations are private, I never paste anything into the 
channel
<m-> and people know this
<Rapture> I don't
<m-> and moreover, I don't want you to make a "public confession"
<m-> I want you to give me, mister sandman, an explanation
<Rapture> sorry, I'm not intrested in jail
<m-> again??? what the fuck does jail have to do in this?
<m-> I just want you to explain me your reasons
<Rapture> I don't trust you, your log and send to #virus
<m-> there's already one guy pasting your stuff into #virus, you know?
<m-> I don't have any interest on publishing your stuff
<m-> I just want to know your reasons
<m-> that's all
<Rapture> sorry
<m-> look, I had a concept about you
<m-> we talked for some minutes and I changed it
<Rapture> which was
<m-> and after what happened with vx.org, I came back to my first 
concept
<m-> and believe I would like to think again you're ok
<m-> but you ain't giving me any reason
<Rapture> dosent matter what you think anymore, we wont be seeing 
eachother ever again
<m-> I don't think so
*** Received a CTCP PING 951953708 from KamF00
<m-> after having seen your picture I don't think you're into sports 
like boxing, so I guess you can't understand why we, people who 
have/are boxed/boxing, for some reason believe the best way to fix 
things when people don't want to speak rationally is to have some 
physical contact
<m-> I mean, i'm not an internet geek hiding behind his computer
<Rapture> I was 12 in that pic
<Rapture> I'm now 18
<m-> and believe I got enough info about you to trace your ass down
<Rapture> alot has changed
<m-> well, good that you're 18... I could be your father
<Rapture> I knew I couldnt trust you
<m-> your error was not to trust me
<m-> since you don't wanna give any explanation to me, I guess you 
don't have it
<m-> or I just assume that
<Rapture> asume whatever you choose to
<Rapture> trace whatever you like
<Rapture> there is no evidence
<m-> there's just one important evidence: I travel to the uk very 
often and I have enough ways to locate you
<Rapture> so when you locate me then what?
<m-> and dude... once this is done...
<m-> a few people in #virus who know me could tell you about previous 
things I had to fix this way
<Rapture> hahaahahhaha
<Rapture> lisiten to yourself
<Rapture> your going to come and beat me up?
<m-> no, I won't travel specifically to do that
<m-> but as soon as i'm back in the uk, you will have one more thing 
to worry about apart from jail
<Rapture> ok il tell you what
<Rapture> when you come to the UK
<Rapture> ne abd you will meet up
<Rapture> and you tell me to my face that your going to  beat me up 
for this whole vx shit
<Rapture> I thouight you were alright
<m-> I won't tell you to your face, I will break it straight away
<m-> I don't like to speak much
<Rapture> I'm pissing myself with laughter here
<m-> i'm not, but I do smile thinking how you will be pissing yourself 
(but not just with laughter) in the near future
<Rapture> near future!@!@!
<Rapture> eye best watch my back !@!
<Rapture> anyhow
<Rapture> its midnight and I have a job, so il see you later 
<m-> this childish stuff ain't up to me, so I will just say you 
goodbye






Note :

HI!
I just want to tell you that you guys are uber k-rad ereet!
then I want to give you my latest advisory.

its no secret that IRC can be a bad place at times. you have people 
insulting you and calling you obscene names, IRC ops who gline you :(, 
ops with no sense of humor and sex freaks who wants to taste your 
thingie.

this little exploit was discovered by me and me alone some days ago.
I was in #k-rad and when I started to brag and spamm a little they got 
mad and set mode to +v.
that means that only people with ops or voice can send text to the 
channel.
needles to say I had none.
here's a short log

<rfp> I am leeter then attrition and l0pth put together!
<prae> we heard you the first 13 times...
<rfp> fux0r j33w! laymuhr!
*** prae sets mode: +m
<prae> 0wnage!
<rfp> laymuhr!
#k-rad Cannot send to channel
<rfp> fux0r j33w!
#k-rad Cannot send to channel
<prae> rfp=0wned

at that time things looked pretty lost. I couldnt talk in the 
channel...
then it hit me, by using this simple little trick you can still get 
your point across!
look and PHEAR!

<prae> h4r h4r
<prae> rfp=0wned
*** rfp is now known as prae-
*** prae- is now known as sucks
*** sucks is now known as nutts
*** nutts is now known as for
*** for is now known as fun
*** fun is now known as HAHAHAHAH
*** HAHAHAHAH is now known as H0H0H0H0H
*** H0H0H0H0H is now known as HAHAHAHAH
*** HAHAHAHAH is now known as H0H0H0H0H
*** H0H0H0H0H is now known as HAHAHAHAH
*** prae sets mode: +b *!*@*.aol.com
*** You were kicked from #k-rad by prae (suck on that you twat!)
#k-rad unable to rejoin channel (you're banned!)


it didn't matter that he banned me because I sk00led him good!
what I did to insult him while being in a moderated channel was to 
simply change my nick
/nick whatever
but instead using my nicks to form a sentence!!!

/nick prae-
/nick sucks
/nick nutts
/nick for
/nick fun
/nick HAHAHAHAH
/nick H0H0H0H0H
/nick HAHAHAHAH
/nick H0H0H0H0H

that's what I did, easy huh?

advisories!

Proper Etiquette and the Do's and Dont's of Sexual Intercourse. 


Welcome friends. This time, we'll be discussing (as the topic 
indicates) what to do while having sex, and what not to do! For those 
of you out there who are saying "Well Chris, I'm too fat to have sex!" 
or "I'm too ugly!" or "I'm too stupid!" Well the fact is - everyone 
gets laid! Whoever you are - HAVE HOPE! If you want it bad enough - 
you've got it. On to the article.

Don't #1: Never EVER talk about your pets, hobbies or past girlfriends 
(oops) during sex. 

Do #1: Masturbate before that big date! Clear out the tubes!

Don't #2: Don't make balloon animals out of any spare condoms you have 
in your wallet - women usually frown upon this.

Do #2: However, they seem mysteriously entertained when you put the 
condoms at the tips of your fingers and say "Look! Edward Penis 
Hands!" 

Ok, so let's get to those of you who haven't had sex. Here's how you 
do it:

1. Pull down your pants.
2. Pull down your boxers (or briefs). Please note this is all you 
really need to take off. However, if you have time you can remove all 
of your clothing.
3. Rip off her pants.
4. Rip off her panties and all other access clothing. (If she's not 
wearing any - you're making great time!)
5. Remember we want to make this as quick as possible. So take the 
Trojan Magnum/Supra you brought with you and rip off the corner with 
your teeth. Insert your finger inside the package and pull downward. 
Remove the condom and place it (pointy thing upwards) on the head of 
your penis. Pull it down as if you are masturbating. If it's too long, 
don't worry - only guys with horse dicks can fill the whole thing up. 
6. Push her down on the bed.
7. Get on top of her.
8. Insert your penis inside her vagina.
9. Here comes the tricky part - Thrust your pelvic area toward her 
then away from her.. kind of like.. you're riding in a car on a bumpy 
road. Think of this as you thrust in and out. 
10. There you go! The basics of sex! Please Note that there are 100's 
of various ways to have sex. Reverse Cowboy Hold, The infamous Doggy 
Style and many, many more. 

Don't #3: When giving oral sex, don't make little noises when you're 
going down on her. Such noises would be: "va-va vooom!!", 
"ayyyyoooogga!" or any asortment of grunts or oinks.

Do #3: When you are receiving oral sex, make funny faces at her when 
she's not looking at you. Then when she looks up, look away casually 
as you get your orgasm.

For more info on sex: Visit your local animal clinic or zoo and view 
the natures of our fine animal friends having at it.

This mad exploit that i found all by myself lets you look
realy totally awsomly leet to everyone that /whois'es you
on IRC!

this involved copy and paste skills

First off, copy this  

then, and here is the trick!!!!
instead of typing:
/join #channel
you type:
/join #channel

now after you enter that channel, whenever someone /whois'es you,
it will seem to them that you are infact OPS! on that channel.

heres a few that i do to seem tough!

/join #k-rad
/join #gps
/join #wasteland
/join #zt
/join #undernet
/join #gaydogsex


Thats it!
check my site at http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/ for more mad exploits!

Elitely enough, I, myself being a ninja trained in the art of 
telecommunications yearn for something more in phreaking, something 
feared++, like run-
on sentences!  Many have tried but failed to successfully hax the 
beeper system.  For 
we all have had the power to Spoof our ani information when paging a 
friend but it was 
all of matter of doing it!  Simply enough.
I am willing to train my fellow comrades in the extra elite stragedy 
in Beeper/Pager Spoofing.

Beeper spoofing is much like diverting.  Disguising your number 
so the other end has no clue who you are.  And with dialects extra 
uberistic way of 
spoofing you too can be phatty-
boomba-latty.  Here's how we do it.

1.] We first call the Victims Beeper
    (example: 973-474-4839)

2.] We then choose our method of madness. 
    Here, we must choose the method to page,
    and not to leave a message!

3.] (Here's the elite part) We now enter a 
    phone number totally different from where
    you're actually calling from! (beeper systems secure!? Bah!)

4.] End call by hitting "#" in most cases.


You may not believe it but what you just did was elitely spoofed 
your ani info.  
In one try you're able to place the victim in total fear mode by 
totally bugging the 
shit outta him/her
when they try to call the number back and find you are not there!!#%  
To find out you were not there in the first place is enough to place 
Houdini in fear 
mode!#  
We use this elite stragedy for throwing off the evil feds that haunt 
us day in day out.  
This one is for you guys! If you run into any trouble don't hesitate 
to mail me at 
dialect@stupidphat.com . Werd. Later.


Shout Outs : #Phreak, #telconinjas, #jungle, #qbasic,#k-rad 
#gay_teen_hackers. and Smartbeep.
Werd to my friend 'Payga-hacka' who currently got arrested for pager 
fraud. Bro, bails coming soon.

[ 8:.  [ Foolproof ]                                     [fluid] :. ]
                                     [fluidenterprises@email.com] :. ]
 ____________________________________________________________________




FoolProof is a tool used by schools, 
internet cafes, libraries and other 
places that don't want you 'fool' 
around on their computers. There is 
only one problem. It only protects the 
system from fools. Anyone with a little 
bit of knowledge(or this guide) could 
easily disable FoolProof. Here's how.

The best method I find for disabling 
FoolProof is to reboot the computer. As 
its starting up hit F8 and boot up 
windows in safe mode. In safe mode, 
FoolProof doesn't run which makes it 
very easy to disable. From there you 
can go to Add/Remove programs and 
uninstall it or rename the fp95 
directory to anything else and it won't 
work when you restart the computer 
again. But there's still my favorite 
method left. Once windows is started in 
safe mode, edit the autoexec and remove 
the line that refers to the fp95 
directory. Then edit config.sys and 
remove the device line that refers to 
the fp95 directory. Then go into 
regedit and go to 
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\W
indows\CurrentVersion\Run and remove 
the two fool proof entries. When you 
reboot the machine, the foolproof 
directory will still be there and it 
will still appear to be installed but 
it won't start up. Another way how you 
can prevent foolproof from starting up 
is press f8 while the computer is 
booting up. Then go to dos without 
autoexec.bat. You will be free to do 
whatever you want from there such as 
rename the foolproof directory or to 
edit it so it won't boot up. A long 
time ago, I think the system admin. 
disabled f on bootup on me. What I did 
then was made a boot disk and inserted 
in the computer. When the computer 
booted up, it give me a command prompt 
in dos, allowing me to remove foolproof 
however I like.

Now, if you'd like to know the password 
and has foolproof installed so that 
foolproof will start and protect but 
you know the password so you can turn 
it on and off as you please. Simple. 
First, do what I said above. Now that 
foolproof is remove turn on the 
computer. Once it boots up, start up a 
keylogger(Keyloggers are available at 
http://www.hackersclub.com/km/files/hfil
es/index.html). Now run the file C:\fp95
\fool32.exe. This will ask for the 
password. Now call over the system 
admin or whoever knows the password and 
ask them if they'll turn it off for a 
sec. So they come and type in the 
password and turn it off, even though 
it's already off and disabled. Once 
they leave, check the keylogger and 
find out the password. You can then 
edit the autoexec.bat, config.sys and 
the registry and put the foolproof 
entries back in so that foolproof will 
boot up, but you can always turn it off 
with your new found password.

If the methods above don't work then 
it's your chance to fool around with 
foolproof. Some things that have helped 
me in the past is Microsoft Word. Open 
up Microsoft Word and go into Help 
About, then click on system 
information. This program allows us to 
do anything Run would allow us to do. 
Thank you Microso$t. You could also 
open up Visual Basic and start a new 
standard exe and put this in:

Private Sub Form_Load()
Dim run
run = Shell("C:\command.com", 1)
End Sub

When you run the program it will open 
up a msdos window. Try out some dos 
commands and see what you have access 
too. It might not be much. Well, those 
are my tips and tricks. Anyone with 
more information feel free to email me 
and share the knowledge. Or, after 
reading this you still can't figure how 
to disable it, email me and I'll try to 
help you out. I'd like to thank 
Nebulous and Virtual Punk for help with 
this article.

 ____________________________________________________________________


1.) R e q u I r m e n t a t I o n s

5 cups of sugar
3 cups of oxygen
1 cup of acids
8 cups of nitrogen peroxide
3 cups of bleach
2 cups of spring water
10 cups salt
1 soda can


2.) I n s t r u c t I o n a t I o n

First, poor the 5 cups of sugar on a table then put 3 cups of oxygen 
on top of 
the sugar. I recommend using an oxygen tank. Now put the 1 cup of 
acids around 
the sugar * * C a u t I o n * * Putting it on the sugar will cause a 
big 
explosion. Now you're ready for the nitrogen peroxide, you can get 
this at 
the pharmacy. Put the nitrogen peroxide on top of the un-opened soda 
can 
until it's filled up the rim. Finally, the bleach...pour the bleach on 
the 
sugars along with some spring water (you can get this at a 
supermarket). Two 
more steps left, you pour the salt evenly on the sugar. The soda can 
will 
explode in 24 hours if you followed my instructions correctly.


3.) C o m m e n t s

- Never listen to k-rad bob's band.
- Tress makes Visual Basic programs.
- Prae sucks at chess.


4.) C o n c l u a t I o n

This old anarchy text might not work anymore, we were cracked by the 
feds 
and they found this text file floating around on the Jolly Ranger 
Database Hard drive diskette.

How to hack the world..

get lunix, and at the shell prompty thing type:
# ./h4x.sh < bitchx us.undernet.org tak | grep "[msg]ampirei) suck my 
monkey"| echo "/dns" > /dev/tty10; cat "/join #hackphreak"; cat "give 
me some broadcast list codez"; echo /dev/tty10 "/set dcc_autoget on" | 
~/

See how easy it was.

now...how to packet the world
this is the ejeet way to do things!
redhat.org secretly disguises itself as someone else when its really a 
variable host!
that means you can specify an ip[ for convenience!
/dns redhat.org
*** resolved redhat.org to 127.0.0.1
SEE!!!!
now
type in IRC /ping redhat.org
it will "pretend" not to work
then /ping redhat.org:ipaddress
now get in your linux box and packed redhat.org
it will forward to the ip address..its ninja!

DONE!

now if your still alive, try and root the fucker
the guys who hide, change their nicks to /dev/hda1
so try and fdisk root them!
type:
# fdisk /dev/hda1
and press d
then 1
then d
and 2
then d
and 3
then d
and 4
then reboot
and his computer will be yours!



check out my k-rad ASCII!

This is supposed to be true!

Highly dubious story, urban myth perhaps, but funny all the same.

One morning around 5am 22 year old Susan DeLucci of Kittery, Maine, 
woke up with a  
painful need to urinate. At first she thought she
had diarrhea, but when she stood up out of bed, she realized that it 
was urinary pain.

It was very similar to the feeling of having diarrhea, just out the
wrong hole. She wobbled to the toilet and upon sitting on it, her 
vagina erupted into 
the most horrific messy farting noise anyone has ever heard. In 
paralyzing pain, Ms. 
DeLucci for the next few minutes
continued to push and squirt out of her vagina a burning tide of 
wretch and filth while 
she gripped the sides of the toilet,
white-knuckled.

She was screaming wildly, and the neighbors called the police. When
medics arrived they found Ms. DeNucci unconscious lying on the floor 
of her bathroom 
wearing nothing but her bath robe.

Running down her leg, was a stream of brown and green syrup. The medic 
had to transfer 
her to a stretcher, so he grabbed her left leg
which was bent crossing her other leg, to straighten her out. She was
lying there all twisted up. When he lifted her left leg to straighten 
her body out, he 
exposed her vagina at which point a creature, no larger than the tip 
of a finger wormed 
its way out of her genitals and landed on the floor with a wet popping 
sound.

Shocked, the medic stared at the creature that was lying on the tile
bathroom floor in a casing of mucous. It was a tiny mud shrimp and it
sat there on the cold floor gasping for water while flipping
itself back and forth.

The horrified medic turned to the toilet as he felt the nausea setting 
in.
When he put his face down into the toilet to puke what he saw was so
horrific that to this day he cannot look into a toilet without 
convulsing.

The entire toilet bowl was boiling with baby brown mud shrimp flipping 
and splashing at 
a furious pace.

If you think that is bad - wait until you hear how it happened:
Ms. DeLucci's death was the result of a combination of shock
and severe head trauma. She stood up over the toilet in pain and when 
she saw what she 
had done, she went into shock and fell, smashing her head on the 
toilet and then on the 
floor.

It is believed by police that two nights before the accident she had
purchased a live lobster at a fish market. While lying in a tub, she
gently inserted the creature's tail into her vagina to derive physical 
pleasure.

At that point, she held a lighter under the creature's face causing it 
to flip its tail 
in a violent snapping motion. The medics found a lesbian XXX video in 
the VCR and the 
TV was positioned on a table in
front of the tub.

The lobster was found in the kitchen garbage can wrapped in a paper 
bag. Traces of Ms. 
DeLucci's DNA were found on the lobster along with pubic hairs that 
had wedged 
themselves between the lobsters' tail
joints. The lobster's face was lightly burned with the same fuel used
in lighters.

The lobster's digestive track and colon were found to be full of mud
shrimp egg casings. Doctors believe that the lobster had eaten
them (they are common in the water at fish markets and are usually
harmlessly boiled to death) and the lobster had crapped them out into 
Ms. DeLucci's 
vagina when she was torturing it. Maine mud shrimp only take two days 
to gestate and 
Ms. DeLucci was only four days away from getting her period. Doctors 
believe that at 
that point of her menstrual cycle, her womb was the perfect PH balance 
to grow these 
mud shrimp which are a much larger version of the popular "Sea Monkey" 
pets sold 
throughout the US. Overnight the eggs had
hatched and the mud shrimp began doubling in size every ten minutes!!!

You can imagine the pain she was in when she woke up that morning and
gave birth to well over 1,000 mud shrimps in her toilet........

Use Math To Figure Out If You're Fat 


Now if you never passed Algebra1    
in high school don't even try to            O             Q
calculate :BMI (BODY MASS INDEX)          --!--         _/ \_
you fat bastard. It's pretty simple         |            \ /      
and if you do something wrong then         / \          /   \
use a damn freagin calculator you        
tubby overweight piece of sh*t.         Skinny-Man      Fat-Man

Here We Go:
----------

Step One: Divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. 
This is your weight in Kilograms.

Step Two: Divide your height in inches by 39.37. (For you retards,12 
inches=1 foot)
This is your height in meters.

Step Three:
Square your result from step two. ( That means multiply it by itself!)

Step Four: Divide your result from step one by the result from step 
three. 

----------

Overweight is defined as a body mass index greater than or equal to 
27.8 for men
Overweight is defined as a body mass index greater than or equal to 
27.3 for women. 
Underweight is defined as a body mass index less than 20 for men and 
21 for women.

[14:.  [ Using a Modem with QBASIC ]                  [niemand1] :. ]
 ____________________________________________________________________







This is a complicated subject to describe without an example, so I'll 
give you one below:

1
cb% = "*67"
CLS
PRINT "Accessing Modem, Please Wait..."
COM(1) ON
OPEN "COM1: 9600" FOR APPEND AS #1
PRINT #1, "ATZ"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATX4S11=50"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATM1"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATL5"; CHR$(15)
CLS
INPUT "Enter phone number to dial or type quit to exit ", phonenumber$
PRINT
phonenumber$ = UCASE$(phonenumber$)
IF phonenumber$ = "QUIT" THEN GO TO 2
phonenumber$ = num%
PRINT "Dialing:"; num%
PRINT #1, "ATDT"; cb%; num%; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 15
2
PRINT #1, "ATH0"; CHR$(15)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATZ"; CHR$(15)
END

Now your probably saying to yourself, "What in fucking Gods name is 
that shit about?", well, I 
will explain it to you.

1
cb% "*67"                   (sets the variable cb% to *67, the ANI 
call blocking feature, tehehe)    
CLS
PRINT "Accessing Modem, Please Wait..."
COM(1) ON                        (turns COM port 1 on, if your modem 
is on COM2 then change this)
OPEN "COM1: 9600" FOR APPEND AS #1      (Sets the baud 9600, and opens 
the COM1 for access as #1)
PRINT 31, "ATZ"; CHR$(15)                                (Tells the 
modem to listen for commands)
SLEEP 1                            (Always put at least one second in-
between each modem command) 
PRINT #1, "ATX4S11=50"; CHR$(15)   (umm I actually forgot what this 
does, but its mandatory, heh)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATM1"; CHR$(15)              (This turns the modem speaker 
on so you can listen to it)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATL5"; CHR$(15)          (sets the modem speaker loud, turn 
it down by changing the 5)
CLS
INPUT "Enter phone number to dial or type quit to exit ", phonenumber$ 
(asks for the phone #, heh)
PRINT
phonenumber$ = UCASE$(phonenumber$)                (upper cases the 
variable, will explain later)
IF phonenumber = "QUIT" THEN GO TO 2
phonenumber$ = num%     (changes the string variable to a numerical 
variable, will explain later)
PRINT "Dialing:"; num%       
PRINT 31, "ATDT"; cb%; num%; CHR(15)                   (Dials the call 
blocking and phone number)
SLEEP 15                       (Waits 15 secs so you can listen to a 
mad guy yelling in the phone)
2
PRINT #1, "ATH0"; CHR$(15)                                                             
(Hangs up)
SLEEP 1
PRINT #1, "ATZ"; CHR$(15)                                             
(Tells the modem your done)
END

First I would like to point out that there is a CHR(15) at the end of 
every modem command, 
basically it makes a character that you could not normally type in 
QBASIC because when you do
the ASCII code "ALT + 15" it would do a command instead of making the 
character. Ok, I know that
probably does not make any sense to you right now so just forget it, 
but ill tell you how it 
works.

PRINT CHR$(245)               (Prints out ASCII character 255, 
whatever char. that might be, heh)

To manually type that character you would do this: ALT + 255 (255 on 
the keypad) and you would 
get this: _ try it. 

Another thing you might notice is that this program has almost 
absolutely no use at all but to 
call someone up and annoy them for 15 secs, heh. The reason I did not 
make it do anything is 
because I didn't want to have to write up a long program just to 
explain simple crap. What you
will learn in this article is not explained in any books I read, I had 
to learn it all on my own,
so keep a copy of it handy if you plan to write programs like this. 
Get a program called ToneLoc
to learn more about modem commands and wardialing.

The reason I made the variable phonenumber$ uppercased is because if 
someone typed quit, they
also might type it QUIT, and capital letters are read as completely 
different in QB. So when
I make it uppercase, I can tell the program to look for the word QUIT, 
instead of both. Since
it automatically uppercases it, I can look for both quit and QUIT. 
Confused yet? If I left that
line out it would only look for QUIT, and if someone typed quit, it 
would not exit the program.
I hope you can understand that part, now lets go to the next.

The reason I changed the string variable into a numerical variable is 
because considering it is
not the word quit, it would be a phone number, so by doing that, I am 
telling the computer that
what is contained in this variable is a number. It can be added, 
subtracted, multiplied, divided,
etc. If I left it as a string variable it could think that it was 
either numbers, letters, or 
a combination of both, which leads me to say don't type in anything 
there except numbers or the 
word quit, because it might get an error.

I am sorry if this article has come a little sketchy, but it is a 
little hard to explain, and I
have never read it anywhere myself. I had to experiment for a long 
time to figure out how to do
this with QB, and if you learned anything here, and can add it to your 
other QB skills, then I
guess I accomplished something. It is late, I'm tired, I'm done, now 
go read the rest of this 
issue of b0g and enjoy.

Peace I'm gone.

WARNING - this will make any bloke shrink into his seat 
read at your peril.  my advice is to PF4 now if you're a bit 
squeamish.

 ---------------------cut if squeamish--------------------------

I once chopped pieces of foreskin off my penis with a pair of 
cuticle scissors.

Now that I've got your attention, I'll go back and tell the 
whole story.


Apologies if it gets a little lengthy, but this yarn deserves to 
be spun well.

BACKGROUND

After I was circumcised as an infant, the wound was not 
taken care of with sufficient diligence, and it healed 
incorrectly.  Portions of the raw edge of the remaining 
foreskin bonded to the glans, a little bit above the lower edge 
of the glans.  This left a series of "skin bridges", basically 
sections of foreskin which can't be retracted, because they are 
fused to the glans at one end and the shaft at the other.  
These varied in width from about 1/16" to 1/4", and were 
attached off and on over about 2/3 of the circumference.

This was never a major problem.  It was a long time before I 
even realized it was abnormal. Everything functioned 
properly, but there were a few minor problems with it which 
made me wish I could fix it.

Mainly,
1.  It was a cosmetic defect -- it didn't look good.
2.  It was tough to keep clean under the bridges -- I had to 
swab it with  a Q-tip now and then to knock down smegma 
buildup.
3.  Some of the most sensitive parts of the glans were hidden 
under relatively insensitive chunks of foreskin, robbing me of 
the proper stimulation which was mine and every man's 
birthright.

Over the past few years, I'd been thinking of getting it 
corrected, But there were problems.  Doctors cost money, 
and I didn't have it, and student insurance sure wasn't gonna 
cover it.  Plus, the thought of some strange doctor chopping 
at my peepeehead gives me chills.

Now, all a doctor would do it sterilize it, numb it, cut it and 
bandage it.

"Hell, maybe I can do that!", I thought.  The problem was 
how to kill the pain.  I experimented with cutting myself 
(with an x-acto knife), but seeing as it always hurt like hell 
before I even cut anything, I never went through with it.

Recently, I came back and studied the situation.  Again, the 
problem with the self-surgery approach was dealing with 
pain.  There had to be some way of numbing the area, but 
how?  One winter day, it hit me. If cold can make fingers go 
numb, then cold can also make a ManToolYtm? go numb.

With this in mind, I pioneered a the "home penile self-surgery 
procedure".

SURGERY KIT
Cuticle scissors (1 pair)
Rubbing alcohol (1 bottle)
Antibiotic ointment (1 tube)
Anti-bacterial soap (1 bottle)
Gauze pads (lots, various sizes)
Ice cubes (iodine added to water for sterility)
Clean Washcloth (freshly laundered with lots'o bleach)
Well-lit work area (the kitchen table)

PROCEDURE

Wipe down work area with alcohol.  Clean penis with soap 
and water, then with alcohol.  Wash hands thoroughly.  Soak 
scissors in alcohol. Holding the ice cube with the washcloth 
(to prevent your fingers from going numb), apply the ice 
cube to the target area.  Hold for 5 to 10 minutes, until area 
is numb.

Using the cuticle scissors, sever the skin bridge as closely as 
possible to its connection with the glans.  Then sever the 
foreskin end of the bridge in such a location as to leave an 
even edge on the foreskin.

Use gauze pads and direct pressure to stop the bleeding, then 
apply antibiotic ointment and bandage.

THE OPERATIONS

Though the operations are not painful if done correctly, the 
healing process is a real pain in the ass.  It also takes a certain 
state of mind to be able to cut your own flesh.  I would kind 
of put myself into robo-man zombie mode for the operations, 
in that I never dwelled on what I was doing, I just 
mechanically plodded through all the steps without thinking 
about how totally gross it was.

Since the ice cube could only numb a small portion of the 
penis, and since I could only tolerate so much trauma to my 
dick in one session, it took 6 separate operations, spread out 
over a two week period, to cut/remove all of the skin 
bridges.

Operation #1  (Day 1)
The test cut.  I chose a small thin skin bridge, about 1/16" 
across. I held the ice cube on for 5 minutes.  The ice caused a 
peculiar kind of "cold ache", but it wasn't that bad.  I gingerly 
made the cuts, and sliced through with no pain at all.  There 
was some minor bleeding, but because of the speed at which 
I worked, I had finished and had the gauze on it before the 
wound had any chance to bleed significantly.

After about 10 minutes the bleeding was stopped and I 
bandaged it up, no problem at all.  Only a tiny little speck of 
flesh had been removed, rather unimpressive looking.

Operation #2  (Day 3)
Operation #1 turned out so well, I decided to go for big 
game this time.

The target was the mother of all skin bridges, about 1/4" 
across and very thick and meaty.  Again, I made the 
preparations and applied ice for 5 minutes.  I made the first 
cut along the glans, and was surprised at how much I had to 
bear down on the scissors.  This skin was surprisingly tough. 
I finished that cut, and then turned my attention to the cut on 
the foreskin side. Wanting to get it done quickly, I decided 
that two large, powerful snips should do the job.  I bore 
down and made the first cut, and realized with a shock that 
IT HURT LIKE HELL.

Well, it turns out that due to the thickness of the skin bridge 
on that end, the cold hadn't penetrated deeply enough, and it 
hadn't gone numb.

So, I was left with a problem.  I had a half severed bit of 
foreskin hanging off me, and no anesthetic.  My only 
recourse was to finish the cut.  I thought, "Shit.  This will 
hurt.".  So I lined up the scissors, closed my eyes, and as 
quickly and powerfully as I could, I made the snip.  My 
prediction was correct; it did hurt (don't you hate when 
you're right about things like that?).  I managed to avoid 
shouting out, instead opting for a few simple gasps and 
whimpers.

I resolved to hold the ice on for much longer infuture 
operations. Being that this was a bigger cut than the first, it 
bled much more profusely.  It took about 20 minutes of 
direct pressure and a lot of gauze until I could staunch the 
main flow.  Even then it kept oozing blood for a few hours.  I 
spent the rest of the evening with nothing on below the waist, 
sitting in front of the TV with a few brews(this became 
standard procedure for all forthcoming operations).  Any 
motion tended to make it break open and bleed again, so I 
moved around very little. I was functioning (that is, walking) 
almost normally again by the next day, but it took about 5 
days before this one completely stopped oozing blood.

As I gingerly hobbled back into the kitchen for another brew, 
I spotted IT, the severed hunk-o-foreskin that I had left on 
the table.

It was of fairly good size, about 1/2" by 1/4" and maybe as 
thick as a piece of bacon. Suddenly, strange thoughts entered 
my skull, and a raging mental battle between good and evil 
ensued.

EVIL: "Eat the foreskin."
GOOD: "Don't do it!!  That's gross!!"
EVIL: "Eat the foreskin."
GOOD: "Stop thinking about it!!"
EVIL: "You know what you must do.  Eat it.  It is your 
destiny."
GOOD: "But that's cannibalism!"
EVIL: "So what?"
GOOD: "Cannibalism is shunned for a reason!  It spreads 
diseases!"
EVIL: "Look dipshit.  It's your own fucking flesh.  Any 
diseases in there, you already got."
GOOD: "But it's SELF-cannibalism!"
EVIL: "So is chewing on the piece of skin you bit off your 
fingertip. BFD."
GOOD: "But this is weird, deranged and perverted!"
EVIL: "Exactly"
GOOD: (Hauls its sorry whupped ass away and shuts up)

So, I ate it.  Turns out it was very tough and chewy, kind of 
like biting a little piece of rubber.  I chewed for about 5 
minutes, but didn't make any progress on breaking it down, 
so I swallowed it.  It had a little bit of blood flavor at first, 
but after that it had no flavor at all; rather disappointing in 
that respect.  Maybe I should have cooked it.

Operation #3 (Day 10)
A medium sized cut.  I held the ice cube on much longer (10 
minutes instead of 5), so there was no problem with pain.  
Not nearly as much bleeding, but still a respectable amount.

A word about erections: they were a bad thing.  Any hard-on 
would tear the wounds open and start them bleeding again.  
This would be a problem for about 3 or 4 days until the 
wounds had healed sufficiently.

Basically, I had to spend a long, long time without even 
thinking a nasty thought.  Of course, when I was asleep I had 
no control over the process, which would always result inme 
waking up with a dick that hurt and bloody bandages.  I was 
really lovin' life at moments like these.

Operation #4 (Day 12)

Another medium sized cut, but with the added bonus of 
having a small vein (about 1 mm in diameter) running 
through the skin bridge.  Now, the blood supply for the penis 
mainly runs through blood vessels buried deep inside.  When 
you get down the the small vessels, the circulatory system 
becomes more of a spiderweb, with redundant paths going to 
every point.

So I knew it wasn't actually dangerous to cut it, but it was 
still a kind of psychological obstacle.  I expected this one to 
be a heavy bleeder, and I wasn't disappointed.  It took about 
a full hour of direct pressure to get the severed ends of the 
vein to close up.

Otherwise, not too much of a problem.

Operation #5 (Day 14)

I was planning on more time to let the others heal, but due to 
changes in the way skin tension was being applied to the 
remaining bridges (because I'd cut some others away), one 
small bridge was getting a lot of stress and starting to hurt.  
So I chopped it quick and easy, no real problems.

Operation #6 (Day 15)

The problem with operation #5 was that it just transferred the 
stress to the next bridge down the line.  So even though I had 
about 3/4" of flesh left to cut, I resolved to do it all at once in 
one last cutting frenzy.

Due to the size of the operation, it took a while to complete 
(maybe 1 minute total), which gave the blood a chance to 
flow.  I had to stop a few times and wipe away blood so I 
could see what I was doing.

Strangely, this didn't bother me at all.  It seemed perfectly 
normal that I should be wiping up copious amounts of blood 
flowing from my bleeding pecker which I had sliced open 
myself.  Actually, it seemed kind of cool at the time, which 
led me to speculate at the time that I had gone insane, which 
I also thought was pretty cool.

Anyway, except for the excess blood which had dripped on 
to the chair, it went quite well.  The only thing that really 
grossed me out was when I noticed I had blood all over my 
hands.  If any psychoanalysts want to analyze that tidbit for 
me, feel free, though I really don't care.

The wounds are now completely healed, and the results are 
good.

Mainly:
1.  There are no scars to speak of, just a few bumps on the 
glans. This is because I didn't trim the flesh quite close 
enough in a few spots. They kind of resembling little warts.  I 
thought about going back and trimming them off, but I kind 
of like 'em now.  After all, it's not everyone who has the 
privilege of appearing to have warts, without actually being 
diseased.
2.  Without the skin tension holding things back, total dick 
length has increased by 1/4".  (Of course I've measured the 
length of my dick. Like you haven't?)
3.  It's a great topic for dinnertime conversation.  Women 
generally seem to find it quite interesting.  Men generally turn 
kind of pale.

With my newfound surgical skills, I've been contemplating a 
few more self-surgical procedures.  You know, mole 
removal, wart removal, nose jobs, the whole vista of 
cosmetic surgery.  I'll need some help for that mole on my 
back, which means training an assistant.  Ah, the future looks 
interesting indeed ...
