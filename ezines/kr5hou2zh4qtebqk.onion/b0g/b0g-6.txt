 ____________________________________________________________________






  Wiretapping is the traditional term for interception of telephone 
conversations. This should not be taken too literally. The word is no 
longer restricted to communications traveling by wire, and 
contemporary wiretaps are more commonly placed on radio links or 
inside telephone offices.
The meaning has also broadened in that the thing being tapped need no
longer be a telephone call in the classic sense; it may be some other
form of electronic communication, such as fax or data.

  Compared with the more precise but more general phrase 
"communications interception," the word "wiretapping" has two 
connotations.
Much the stronger of these is that a wiretap is aimed at a particular 
target, in sharp contrast to the "vacuum cleaner" interception widely 
practiced by national intelligence agencies. The weaker connotation is 
that it is being done by the police.

  The history of wiretapping in the United States is in fact two 
histories intertwined. It is a history of wiretapping per se--that is, 
a history of the installation and use of wiretaps by police, 
intelligence agencies, honest citizens, businesses, and criminals. It 
is also a history of society's legal response to wiretapping by these 
various groups.

  The origins of wiretapping lie in two quiet different practices: 
eaves dropping and letter opening. "Eavesdropping," although once more 
restricted in meaning, has come to describe any attempt to overhear 
conversations without the knowledge of the participants. "Letter 
opening" takes in all acquisition, opening reading, and copying of 
written messages, also without knowledge of the sending and receiving 
parties. Telecommunication has unified and systematized these 
practices.

  Before the electronic era, a conversation could only be carried on 
by people located within earshot of each other, typically a few feet 
apart.
Neither advanced planning nor great effort on the part of the 
participants was required to ensure a high degree of security. Written 
communications were more vulnerable, but intercepting one was still a 
hit-or-miss affair. Messages traveled by a variety of postal services, 
couriers, travelers, and merchants. Politically sensitive messages, in 
particular, could not be counted on to go by predictable channels, so 
special couriers were sometimes employed.

  And written messages enjoyed another sort of protection. Regardless 
of a spy's skill with flaps and seals, there was no guarantee that, if 
a letter was intercepted, opened, and read, the victim would not 
notice the intrusion.
Since spying typically has to be done covertly in order to succeed, 
the chance of detection is a substantial deterrent.

  Electronic communication has changed all this in three fundamental
ways: it has made telecommunication too convenient to avoid; it has,
despite appearances, reduced the diversity of channels by which 
written messages once traveled; and it has made the act of 
interception invisible to the target.

  Conversation by telephone has achieved an almost equal footing with
face-to-face conversation. It is impossible today to run a successful 
business without the telephone, and eccentric even to attempt to do 
without the telephone in private life. The telephone provides a means 
of communication so effective and convenient that even people who are 
aware of the danger of being overheard routinely put aside their 
caution and use it to convey sensitive information.

  As the number of channels of communication has increased (there are
now hundreds of communication companies, with myriad fibers, 
satellites, and microwave links), the diversity of communication paths 
has diminished. In the days of oxcart and sail, there was no registry 
of the thousands of people willing to carry a message in return for a 
tip from the recipient. Today, telecommunications carriers must be 
registered with national and local regulatory bodies and are well 
known to trace associations and industry watch groups. Thus, 
interception has become more systematic. Spies, no longer faced with a 
patchwork of ad hoc couriers, know better where to look for what they 
seek.

  Perhaps more important, interception of telecommunications leaves no
telltale "marks on the envelop." It is inherent in telecommunication--
and inseparable from its virtues--that the sender and the receiver of 
a message have no way of telling who else may have recorded a copy.

  Any discussion of wiretapping, particularly a legal discussion, is 
complicated by the fact that electronics has not only made 
interception of telecommunications possible; it has also made it 
easier to "bug" face-to-face conversations. Bugging would be nearly 
irrelevant to the central subject of this document--Taking A Deeper 
Trip Into Wiretapping--were it not for the fact that bugs and wiretaps 
are inseparably intertwined in law and jurisprudence and named by one 
collective term: electronic surveillance.

  Wiretaps and bugs are powerful investigative tools. They allow the
eavesdropper to overhear conversations between politicians, criminals,
lawyers, or lovers without the targets' knowing that their words are
being share with unwanted listeners. Electronic surveillance is a tool
that can detect criminal conspiracies and provide prosecutors with 
strong evidence--the conspirators' incriminating statements in their 
own voices--all without danger to law-enforcement officers. On the 
other hand, the very invisibility on which electronic surveillance 
depends for its effectiveness makes it evasive of oversight and 
readily adaptable to malign uses.
Electronic surveillance can be and has been used by those in power to
undermine the democratic process by spying on their political 
opponents.
In light of this, it is not surprising that Congress and the courts 
have approached wiretapping and bugging with suspicion.

  Today, communication enjoys a measure of protection under US law,
and neither government agents nor private citizens are permitted to 
wiretap at will. This has not always been the case. The current view
that wiretaps are a kind of search--has evolved by fits and starts 
over a century and a half. The Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that the 
police may not employ wiretaps without court authorization. Congress 
has embraced this principle, limiting police use of wiretaps and 
setting standards for the granting of warrants. The same laws prohibit 
most wiretapping by private citizens.

  The rules against unwarranted wiretapping are not absolute, however.
For example, the courts ruled in 1992 (United States vs. David Lee 
Smith, 978 F. 2nd 171, US App) that conversations over cordless phones 
were not protected and that police tapping of cordless phones did not 
require a search warrant. A 1994 statute (Communications Assistance 
for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-414, §202) extended 
the warrant requirements of the earlier law to cover cordless phones. 
The law also makes some exceptions for businesses intercepting the 
communications of their own employees on company property.

  Feedback would be nice <psyops@phault.org>.

      BASH is fucking vulnerable .. every version of it .. the newest 
exploit posted here cuz BugTraq sucks (just kidding , /me is too lame 
to publish an exploit :// )
      

So kidz , wanna impress some class-mate chix0r wit y3r 31337 h4x1ng 
skee1z?
Wanna show her what rewt means , still you can't hack the school 
computer that's running Linux?
Well , check THIS new exploit out ( actually it's not an exploit , but 
I think a script-kiddie will love it) 
You only need a fucking valid account there , bash and ... oh , 2 
brain cells.
Log at your shell and follow the next 6 basic steps:

1) Issue this :  
$ echo "PS1='[root@\h /root]#'" >> .bash_profile
$ echo "PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH" >> .bash_profile
Done? Not yet? Uhm .. man , don't fucking write the "$" . That's your
prompt :/ . Boy , are you dum....

2) Make a directory in your home directory.Call it bin .
First change to the home directory:
$ cd        
Next , do it:
$ mkdir bin
And cd to it:
$ cd bin

3) Make 2 files using a text editor.Let's say we're using pico. The 
philez name SHOULD and MUST be 'whoami' and 'id'
$ pico whoami
--cut here--
#!/bin/bash
# the whoami thingie
echo root
--stop cutting--

$ pico id
--cut here--
#!/bin/bash
# the id thingiez
echo "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) 
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)"

--stop cutting--

4) Make them executable philes. Oh , you don't know what that means .. 
and yet you want root. God thank me for not letting you have the 
fucking real admin rights there. So .. do this in the directory where 
'id' and 'whoami' are stored (~/bin)

$ chmod +x whoami
$ chmod +x id

5) Change ,thru .bash_profile , some of the shell variables : LOGNAME 
or USER ( some of the variables are read-only and i'll treat this 
subject l8r)

$ echo "LOGNAME=root" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "USER=root" >> ~/.bash_profile 


6) Now logout and login. If you did what i've just told you you should
have a prompt similar to root's one. Oh ,and when you write whoami and 
id it should tell that you're root. Simple , eh?

Let's say that you want to go further.There are plenty of thingz to be
done and i'll cover some of them in the second part of this 
"shitlist".



I just hope that you can actually find a chick that likes leet hackers
like you. You'll just end up showing this to some weird nerd that'll 
truly admire you and wink at you , and act really strange and ask you 
out :\.




So .. you learned how to fake your identity on a Linux machine thru 6 
steps. But , heh, what if the guy you're trying to trick is smart and 
he puts you to do thingz that only root can?
What can root do and a normal user can't? See below for a few neat 
tricks

*** printing /etc/shadow's content ***

For this trick you need a shadow file. You can take it from your own 
box (actually that's dumb if it's found out).Upload this shadow file 
into the
fake-root Linux account in the ~/bin folder ( ~ means your home dir , 
you gimp!) .
Now we have to do a new k3w1 m4d r33t script. Let's fake the `cat`
command cause that's the way you view the damn /etc/shadow file.
So ..

$ cd ~/bin
Ooops .. i forgot that you just used PS1 to fake the prompt =]. I 
actually
ment '# cd ~/bin' :PPPP

# cd ~/bin
# pico cat

Now paste this eleet script 
--- start cutting ---
#!/bin/bash
found=0
y='/bin/cat '
for x in $*
do

if [ $x != '/etc/shadow' ]
then
y=$y' '$x
else
found=1
fi
done

if [ $found = 1 ]
then
$y $HOME/bin/shadow
else
/bin/cat $*
fi
--- stop cutting  ---
Now cat will print YOUR shadow file if you issue a `cat /etc/shadow`
and will just act normally in any other cases. You probably say : 
"geez , what a lame script , i could have done it in 3 rows". Hey 
motherfucker , wake up from your dreaming. Maybe your pals are 
actually smarter than you.
I was safe to make my script keep the switches for example. So , if 
you do a `cat -E -n /etc/shadow` or a `cat -n /etc/shadow -E` it'll 
still work just fine.
Next , `chmod +x cat` so you can actually use it .. and that's it.
Have fun!


*** mounting a file system ***

Heh , i know whatcha gonna say : "mount ain't that important!!". But
goddammit , when you're not root and you can't mount a file system and
yet you try to mount it , the shell gives you that nasty output : 
"only root can do that" .
Just enter you good old bin directory and make a 'mount' file.Since 
you can't really fake a mounting , at least let's get rid of that 
"only root.." error.
For example : 
--- cut here ---
#!/bin/bash
# This iz the phile that fakes mounting.
# Name it mount and put it in ~/bin
# Don't forget to chmod it so you can run it

if [ $# = 0 ]
then
/bin/mount
exit
fi
if [ "$1" = "-V" ]
then
/bin/mount -V
elif [ "$1" = "-h" ]
then
/bin/mount -h
else
echo "only root CAN'T do that"
fi

--- stop it , man ---

Heh , lame phile and you should change that stupid "only root CAN'T do
that" thing to one of your own or something that appears more often.

There are plenty of other thingz that can be done with this PATH 
trick.
For those silly newbies that don't know even the basics , if i set
PATH=my_directory:/bin:/usr/bin then the shell will first look in
my_directory to find a command/file.


Now , if you're careful enough , you can leave the impression that 
you're really root on that system. Still , there are things where you 
can be catched as a liar ://. For example

[root@somelamebox ~]# cd /root
bash: /root: Permission denied
[root@somelamebox ~]# 

Doesn't exactly look like a root account ,eh? :/ .It's not too easy to
fake the cd command as it is an internal function of bash. You can 
still set your prompt to something like PS1='[root@\h /root]# '. Other 
TODO thingz are :

- faking ls not to show the content of the /home/$USER/bin
- killing and starting some processes
- uhm .. i dunno, but if bob publishes this (although i don't see a 
good reason that he does it) i'll continue this with more eleet ideas 
;]


I'm sorry for my bad english and for some mistakes that i made ( 
redirect flames to /dev/null ) but i had to write it in a very short 
time.
I am TOTALLY responsible for the harm that you may cause with the 
ideas/scripts posted here =]
And to quote Phuck(that's the real name of Phrack) i may say that this 
is for and by the lamers community >:>
Happy faking!

->Lesson One: Making Yourself Appear More Elite Than You Actually Are.

        -In real life, or on IRC, the most important thing that a girlie looks for 
in a hax0r is skill (she hopes it will move her up in the world), whether it is 
real skill (which is hard to come by these days) or if its simply an elite host 
(hax0r@fbi.gov). 
        
        -To make yourself appear more elite than you actually are (or ever will 
be), the first step is getting yourself an elite host (2845818@shellyeah.org 
probably won't cut it), either by means of a shell, wingate, or bnc (and if you 
don't know of these things, just tell the girl you admin some big network in 
your spare time and Im sure she'll be impressed).

        -In all retrospect, most girlies don't know the difference between _you_ 
and the real thing, so don't worry.

        -Opposing popular use...to the majority of girlies, it is best not to use 
leet speak      (eye 4m 4 m45t0r hax0r); this will more often than not end up 
confusing them and leave them bewildered. Thus, trying to impress them will 
prove useless. If you happen to have a girl that knows 'leet speak', don't 
directly use this speak with her either, but use it when she is in the premises 
("y0 m4ng, u b3tt4 ch3ck y0s3lf b4 u wr3ck y0s3lf"). This       will undoubtfully 
make you appear more elite/phearful than you actually are.

        -For those of you who are more 'skilled', deface webpages in the fair name 
of your girlie... ("U R 0wned; mad props to my girlie"). This is a concept far 
beyond most girlies, and seeing their name on www.yahoo.com proves very 
impressive.

A few other methods of making yourself appear elite: 

-obtaining operator status in as many channels as possible, do whatever you can 
to do so... suck dick, kiss ass, or stomp on some heads.

-pinging out her enemies on command will impress/delight her enough to have even 
cyber sex with you... might wanna keep that in mind.

-using random 'big' words such as "heuristic control algorithm" or 
"pleisiochronous  communications" will be sure to impress... they do not even 
have to be in an order that makes  any sense. As long as your girlie hears 'big 
important words', she will believe that you are  elite...and the sad part is,

I'm writing this for you today to illustrate the importance of good 
masturbation.  Philosophy wise, masturbation has the ability to lessen teen 
pregnancy.  Others believe it's a sin due to the explicit nature of thoughts as 
you masturbate.  But today we will demonstrate the different aspects of enjoying 
those thoughts.

First hand position:  The "Fist"
The fist is widely used, and popular amongst the teenage individuals.  The fist 
method is the base for many other methods, like the "rocker," or the "double 
fisted willy choker."  The key to good fist action is in the wrists.  Many young 
individuals, not very experienced like myself, use their upper arm and run short 
of breath by the time of ejaculation.  Another trick to good fist action is a 
tight grip.  Don't grab too tight, otherwise it starts to hurt, but a 
comfortable grip will do.  This is where the "double fisted willy choker" is 
useful.  The double fisted willy choker uses two hands, one hand grips penis, 
and the other wraps around securing the grip.  This allows the masturbator to 
relax his main hand, and still keep a tight grip.  Using the double fisted willy 
choker, you can go into a transition into the "rocker."  The rocker is very 
useful for those short of breath.  To do the rocker, stand up, start off with 
the double fisted willy choker, and then jump up and down relaxing your arms, 
allowing the weight of your arms to do the masturbating for you.  

The Second hand position:  The "Simulated Camel Toe"
The simulated camel toe is not widely used, due to it's complexity, and 
requirement for flexibility.  This method is done by placing both index fingers 
together, and both thumbs together.  Now make the hole as large as needed.  Some 
prefer tight, but as you've noticed, making a small hole requires too much 
flexibility, which is uncomfortable.  The simulated camel toe can then alter to 
perform the "sandwich."  The sandwich again requires two hands; fortunately 
flexibility is not a problem.  To perform the sandwich, it's like clapping your 
hands, except in this case, there's something in the middle.

The Third hand position:  "Fakie" 
Fakie is the "fist" method, in reverse.  By this I mean your thumb and 
forefinger should be facing down.  The fakie is useful in the sense, that some 
people get arm cramps.  This method uses different arm muscles, allowing pain 
free masturbation.

The Forth position:  "Couch Crack"
This is not exactly a hand position, but famous non the less.  The couch crack 
utilizes the crack between the cushions of your couch.  To execute this method, 
just stick it between the crack, and start humping.

Brown Finger Fist Action
The following position gives you that little more satisfaction. To get the best 
out of this position i recommend that you are on a bed, couch, and you have a 
pair of gloves (i prefer a clear kind) Firstly you need to slap your penis 
around to get it hard. Once your penis is hard you must gently tug on your penis 
for about 10-15 seconds, now you place your left index finger (if your right 
handed) into your anus. Slide your finger in and out gently while u continue to 
tug on your penis gently. After about 30 seconds the average person will reach 
there climax and blow there load. I like to describe this as the most satisfying 
masturbation known to man. *warning* using moms cleaning gloves is never a good 
idea.

Newbie note:  Doing any methods mentioned above, while spectators witness such 
an act of stupidity, will get you in the front page of your local newspaper.

You could go to jail warning:  And yes, they will charge you for indecent 
exposure.  I recommend you think before you act, otherwise, you'll be sharing a 
jail cell with some guy named Spike, who doesn't have to masturbate, he's got 
you to bend over for him now.

There is more to masturbating than just different ways of doing it.  There is 
the element of 'where' you do it.  The excitement of the different places of 
masturbating is overwhelmed by the many different public locations in your area.

Location Number One:  Your Bed
Your bed is the most basic location of masturbation.  The only difficulties that 
you may encounter are that the bedsprings can be loud.  Instead of on your bed, 
I suggest you masturbate on the floor.  This will eliminate the sound of 
bedsprings, allowing you to stay stealth.  

Location Number Two:  The Parent's Bed
This could be difficult to manage, although the experience is always something 
to tell your kids (or maybe not, unless you want them to masturbate on your 
bed).  Of course you would do this while they are gone, so stealth is not 
necessary.  

Location Number Three:  The Closet
The closet is always nice for the daytime urges, which may overcome your self-
discipline.  If you have to masturbate during daylight hours, the closet allows 
hiding from any neighbors that might see you otherwise through the window.  
Although the closet provides visual stealth, sound may be a predicament if your 
closet walls are connected to any rooms in the house.  

Location Number Four:  Pools/Hot Tubs/Lakes
These three locations are a luxury.  Not many individuals can masturbate in a 
pool, but if you ever have a chance to, it's the greatest.  Just make sure no 
one sees you doing this, other wise, this could prove to be very embarrassing.  

Location Number Five:  The Shower
The shower is the next best thing to a pool, hot tub, or a lake. The shower 
provides the soothing hydro pulsating massage therapy, while your masturbating 
to the chick you saw last night.  The great part of "showerbating" is the fact 
that any noise you make will be drowned out by the water.  "Bathbating" on the 
other hand is great and all, but stealth is a requirement.  

Experiment with the many locations in your area.

In conclusion, we have discovered the many ways of self-pleasure.  We have also 
established the fact that whom ever thinks it's a sin to masturbate, doesn't 
know how fucking great it is to shoot a wad six feet in the air, and have it 
land on the bulls eye on the piece of paper lying at your feet (this game might 
go in my next guide).

b0g:
  Ive been reading your parodies ever since hackers was barely
  finished, and I have to ask, where do you get your elite 0-d4y movie warez?
  Would you like more 0-d4y movie warez from a cable ftp? Are you open to
  suggestions for parodies?
  
Cr0bar:
  I don't know. . . .I work in the MAE-WEST NOC, and this guy on IRC told
  me to set up something called "warftpd", it made all the lights on our
  routers start flashing really fast, since then, all these really cool
  programs and movies have been showing up on my hard drive.  Seriously
  though, I buy the DVD of every movie that I bastardize, The Matrix was
  done using a VCD because I couldn't figure out how to do frame grabs off
  the DVD.  I may re-do The Matrix off the DVD now that I know how.  Sort
  of like the Star Wars Special Edition(s).
 
b0g: 
  You obviously have elite PrintScreen skills, how would you rate
  yourself on the following scale: AOL, Prodigy, Canuck, Ping.exe,
  /bin/bash/ping -f,  Script kiddy, User, Root, Sysadmin, wh0rde, or Burrows.
  
Cr0bar:
  Definetly whore.  Er, it depends.  Sysadmin is the highest level which I
  recognize, so I guess that's me.  I don't see ubergeek on your list.
  
b0g:
  What is your favorite:
  IRC Server? (Efnet, Unet..)
  OS? (Linux, Fbsd, Nbsd, Solaris, Windoze..)
  Text editor? (vi, pico, jove, notepad, winword (sigh)..)
  Sandwich? (Subway, Sloppy Joe, Club..)
  
Cr0bar:
  I'm partial to efnet myself, although I started on newnet (Shout-outs to
  Snowcrash, dstf, and the Optics...they knew me as "bytstream") and I
  only go to dalnet for hardcore porn.  I use windows because you just
  can't get photoshop and half-life for linux (The gimp can suck it).  I
  prefer linux or fbsd on my servers, because they make me look cool.
  
b0g:
  Have you ever seen a half naked mormon from Utah write "b0g 0wnz me"
  on his chest? If not, would you like to?
  
cr0bar:
  Only if he was about to be shot.
  
b0g:  
  What are your favorite sites to visit besides b0g.org?
  
Cr0bar:
  You mean besides my customized Yahoo! start pages????
  I think I've visited b0g.org once, when someone from there was trying to
  get me to link them....but to answer your question, I am a regular
  reader of hardocp.com, penny-arcade.com, userfriendly.org,
  arstechnica.com, theregister.co.uk, slashdot.org, and a few others that
  I don't visit enough to count as "regulars".  
  
b0g:
   Do you have any boy/girl Mtv style mp3s on any of your computers?
  (Titney Spears, Backdoor Boys, Off`Sync..)
  
Cr0bar:
  Does the "Make My Boobies One More Size" parody count?
  I have music that has appeared on MTV, none of the teenybopper stuff I
  assume you're referring to.
 
b0g: 
  What are your feelings about Napster?
  
Cr0bar:
  It exists for only one purpose, and that is piracy, which I can't
  condone in good conscience.  However, good conscience doesn't seem to
  have much of a hold on most of the world, including myself, and napster
  certainly has a right to exist.  I have begun purchasing all the CDs for
  albums which I originally had on mp3.  The ones that I didn't think were
  good enough to purchase, I erased.  This is because I support the
  artist, and I don't have room on my RAID array for shitty music.
  
b0g:
  What are your feelings on Metallica and Dr Dre?
  
Cr0bar:
  I really think "no" means "no", regardless of how many drinks you've
  had.  The least Metallica could've done was wear condoms.  I hope Dre
  tests negative and is able to sit and walk normally soon.  Wait, what
  was the question?
  
b0g:
  If you could pick one moment in your life, besides reading issue 5 of
  b0g, that you could relive (and it cant involve crisco), what would it
  be?
  
Cr0bar:
  I want to say [edited], but people I know will read this.  So, I'll just
  say the moment when I woke up and saw that my site had been slashdotted,
  and then the next hour or so right up until the sysadmin of my server
  called and yelled at me to shut it off because it was killing his
  operation.
  
b0g:
  Are you into hax0ring the planet? Do you feel the government is
  trashing our rights?
  
Cr0bar:
  Breaking into systems is no cooler than breaking into someone's car or
  home, even if you don't do any damage.  Sorry, but it's true.  However,
  "The Man" is getting us down, and needs to wise up before meddling with
  our supermation infohighway.
  
b0g: 
  What is the significance behind your h4x0r handle? If you had the
  opportunity to give Linus Torvalds, Big Willy Gates, and Rob Malda from
  slashdot h4x0r handles, and they have to use a dash "-" somewhere, what
  would they be? If you picked Pig-Fucker for Big Willy, can you explain
  why?
  
Cr0bar: 
  I picked "cr0" semi-randomly a few years ago when registering for a
  BBS.  Then I found out that it has a few "leet" connotations, if you
  will.  Apparently, there is a register in some CPUs called "cr0", which
  I found was sufficiently obscure to add "leetness" to my handle.  About
  a year after I started going by "cr0", I decided that I didn't like the
  associationw with "crow", so I changed my name to "cr0bar" (Everyone's
  favorite implement, for any task).  To this day, people still call me
  "cr0", except for Scott "Damage" Wasson of the Tech Report, who says,
  "sup, 'bar?".
  
  Linus Torvalds would have to be Trans-Meta, because I don't know what it
  means or is good for, but it seems to have gotten a lot of attention.
  It's hard to come up with a unique jab at Bill Gates, and I'm too tired
  to think about Rob Malda intelligently, do I lose points for skipping
  questions?

 Introduction --



  As the number of wireless subscribers throughout Canada and the United States
continues to increase dramatically each year, wireless carriers will be facing
the challenges that rapid growth creates. One such challenge in this market
is the migration from a single Home Location Register (HLR) to a multiple HLR
topology.

The HLR, which successfully stores critical identification and 
subscription information about each customer, can become a network bottleneck
either because of the sheer number of subscribers contained in the database, or 
because of the number of SS7 messages arriving at the HLR. A single HLR also
poses a risk to the overall survivability of the entire wireless service under
the new SS7 protocol.

Assembling additional HLR carriers to a wireless network presents significant
and problematical challenges, however. If the existing routing algorithms are
simply expanded, then every Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and Signal Transfer
Point (STP) on the network is affected, and the routing table management becomes 
extremely complicated and highly error prone.

(STPs are the packet switches of the SS7 network. They receive and route incoming 
 signaling messages towards the proper destination and also perform specialized
 routing functions.)

Many of the challenges in multiple HLR deployment are constantly an issue,
and are constantly being worked upon. Fortunately a company by the name
of MicroLegend has developed a centralized SS7 message routing system called 
the 'SCCP Relay.' The SCCP Relay supports all of the necessary GSM SS7 message
routing tables to allow wireless carriers (specifically GSM/GPRS) to easily
expand to a multiple HLR topology.

Throughout this document, I will attempt to introduce a new technology within the 
new world of the Out-of-band signaling SS7 architecture -- it is here to stay
and it has taken over the world telecommunications significantly from its older 
counterpart switching system known as 5ESS. 

Now please, sit back and relax, and prepare to enter the world of the SS7 Signaling 
Connection Control Part Relay System...


 Key Benefits of SCCP Relay --



  A number of key benefits of the SCCP Relay (which deserve some mention) are:


  'Reduced operations and maintenance overhead'
   -------------------------------------------

The routing information for each subscriber is centralized in the SCCP Relays,
rather than being distributed among all of the STPs (Signal Transfer Point)
and MSCs (Mobile Switching Center). This useful and practical method simplifies
the process of entering and maintaining STP/MSC information, not to mention
the problems involving troubleshooting of SS7 routing.


  'Providing a scaleable architecture for growth'
   -------------------------------------------- 

The SCCP Relay simplifies the addition of multiple Home Location Registers (HLRs)
as the network itself develops. Much work has been done in this sector of
SCCP development, and will continue to innovate the telecommunications industry.


  'Improved overall network reliability'
   ------------------------------------

The SCCP Relay supports the automatic routing of SS7 messages to a backup 
Home Location Register (HLR) in the event of a Primary HLR failure. This
unique and useful feature enables the multiple HLRs to be configured in a
redundant and scaleable fashion, entering that the service itself remains
available to customers even in the rare case of an HLR failure. From my
knowledge of the SCCP Relay system, its up-time is approximately 99.99%. Impressive.

  
  'Flexible connection options'
   ---------------------------

The SCCP Relay supports all types of Signaling System 7 (SS7) links, it can
operate as an STP (Signaling Transfer Point), connecting directly to mobile
switching centers (MSCs), Home Location Registers (HLRs) and other end nodes.
Typically, the flexible connection types of SS7's Signaling Transfer Points (STP) 
can be configured to the proper destination in existing incoming routing functions.

 
  'Mated pair deployment / Auto re-routing'
   ---------------------------------------

The SCCP Relay is deployed in a mated pair configuration, with each link being
fully and 100% redundant. Each mated pair system is capable of handling the full of
of network traffic (5,000,000 subscribers) with virtually no problems whatsoever.


Platform & Application / Security Issue --


Since its inception in 1994, Microlegend has focused exclusively on Signaling
System 7 network solutions. Microlegend's products support Intelligent Network
services, resolve interworking problems, switching signaling traffic, interface
SS7 and IP networks, and PROTECT network resources for telecommunications companies
worldwide. 

Because of this, Microlegend has implemented ways which enable them to do
their job quickly and reliably. Unfortunately the problem they are faced with
is the issue concerning database security. 

For example:

When Microlegend's team of engineers want to perform system diagnosis,
software updating, and subscriber databasing with "maximum efficiency", they 
simply use a dial-up connection. This dial-up connection (located in Ottawa Ontario)
requires absolutely no login or password at all - just the telephone number,
and the optimal performing Unix Operating System known as 'VxWorks'.

What is at stake:

- Microlegend faces being compromised by hackers/phreakers and malicious
  persons. These persons could take advantage of this security flaw and
  steal potentially sensitive company information.

- The telecommunications infrastructure which supports well over 5,000,000
  (five million) subscribers throughout Canada and the United States.

- Loss of revenue in the Billions due to time spent security auditing.


What can be done:

 Instead of Microlegend compromising security for obscurity by using a dial-up 
 account to perform their system diagnosis, software updating, and subscriber
 databasing, they should use their 10BaseT Ethernet LAN with an SSH connection
 to perform the necessary tasks.

 
        
 SCCP Relay & GTT Functional Description --


 
 A detailed understand of the SCCP Relay product requires quite a bit of
grounding in the works of GSM networks. For convenience, I will explain
the brief key concepts of GSM network operation in relation to SCCP Relay
and GTT functioning.

The SCCP Relay provides a "central point" for GTT provisioning and execution on
behalf of the entire GSM carrier's SS7 network. The SCCP Relay performs GTT
capabilities for both the IMSI (123049210) and MSISDN (Mobile Subscriber Integrated 
Services Digital Network) Adress types, eliminating the need to continually manage the
routing tables within STPs (Signaling Transfer Point) or MSCs (Mobile Switching Center).

SCCP Relay    STP/MSC



[[ The SCCP Relay is deployed as a redundant pair of signaling nodes that can
be accessed via SS7 links connected to currently deployed STPs or can be utilized
as the STPs themselves. Where STPs previously have been deployed, the SCCP
messages are routed to the Relay (partial GTT) by the STP/MSC. The SCCP Relay
then performs system translation (either full or partial, depending on the provisioned
data), and routes the message back to the network to be automatically forwarded
to the destination HLR. The SCCP Relay can also perform the MTP routing, which is
the main function of the STPs. This incredible capability enables the SCCP Relay to
be deployed in networks without STPs. See the ASCII Diagram Above. ]]


 SCCP Relay Software Architecture --



The SCCP Relay System is a solution based upon the 'Versatile Signaling Point' (VSP).
         
      || [look for a guide pertaining to VSP on 
    Nettwerked soon: http://nettwerk.hypermart.net] ||
        
At the "heart" of the SCCP Relay is the object oriented SS7 stack that provides
all the basic capabilities of a Signaling Transfer Point (STP) without compromising
speed or security (well, maybe not security... but I'll look into it).

The VSP SS7 Stack includes MTP and SCCP layer functionality with a configurable
GTT application, along with user interface, functioning log files (intruders beware!),
and several SCSI Disk Processes.

The GTT process supports both IMSI and MSISDN numbering formats, and as
a group, these processes are referred to as the SS7 Message Handler Unit (MHU).

Basically what the SS7 MHU does is simple: it terminates the SS7 links, performs
the GTT on incoming SS7 messages, and then re-routes the messages back onto the 
SS7 network. To optimize its performance, the MHU runs on that real-time UNIX
operating system (you guessed it) 'VxWorks'.

The SCCP Relay system with its Versatile Signaling Point platform also includes
an independent Database Administration Unit (DAU), that supports the provisioning
and administration of the GTT data. The DAU, which happens to run on a UNIX-based
Operating system (gotta love UNIX!) called AIX, includes a command parser, database
manager, and an SCSI disk interface. The DAU and MHU communicate with each other in
parallel a highly redundant 10BaseT Ethernet LAN. An Ethernet WAN is used to
connect the SCCP Relays, to ensure that they remain synchronized with each other
properly.

In addition to the software running on the DAU and MHU, the SCCP Relay system 
incorporates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) program that can be installed on 
several of the operating stations. This user interface provides the ability to 
provision and view the GTT data that resides on the DAU, as well as the option
to view the log information collected about GTT database transactions!

The operation stations connect to the SCCP Relay through a LAN or WAN, depending
on what option you choose. In addition, a custom interface to an existing provisioning
system can be developed to provision and view the entire GTT database. 
For convenience check out the following terribly drawn ASCII diagram to get a better
idea about how the SCCP Relay's DB Admin works with AIX and how the Message Handler
works with VxWorks and how they all work together on the seamless 10BaseT LAN/WAN.

 SCCP Relay Hardware Architecture --

 
 The VSP platform, on which the SCCP Relay runs, is available in a verity
of configurations and sizes. The VSP scales smoothly from an economical system
with only four SS7 links to a fully loaded system with over 75 SS7 links.

The basic structure of the hardware components of the SCCP Relay, regardless
of the size and configuration, are exactly the same. The only real differences
between small systems and large systems are the number of cards, and the size of 
the chassis itself.

The MHU is controlled by a System Controller card based on a 200 MHz PowerPC(tm)
processor. This processor controls the system level functions, including the TCP/IP
port, the serial ports, and the SCSI interface for the disk drive. It also provides
control for two Link Interface (LI) cards, with up to four SS7 links on each.
As these Link Interface cards are added, every third card is a Link controller card,
with its own 300 MHz PowerPC(tm) processor. This distributed processor architecture
ensures that the SCCP Relay has sufficient power to handle very large numbers of 
subscribers (over 5,000,000 [Five Million]).

Each Link Interface card can support as many as four (4) SS7 Links. The V.35 cards
provide four SS7 ports, while the E1 and T1 versions provide two SS7 ports each.

The DAU runs in its own independent chassis, with its own independent fan, SCSI disk
and power supply. It uses the same System Controller card as the MHU, without the need
for the use of any Link Interface or Link Controller cards.

           SS7 Message Handling Unit




   GSM Background Information -- (Acronym Definitions in paragraph form)



'Home Location Register (HLR)'


A Home Location Register (HLR) is a database that contains semipermanent mobile
subscriber information for a wireless carriers' entire subscriber base.

HLR subscriber information includes the International Mobile Subscriber Identity
(IMSI), service subscription information, location information (the identity of
the currently serving Visitor Register (VLR) to enable the routing of mobile-terminated
calls), service restrictions and supplementary services information.

What the HLR basically does is it handles SS7 transactions with both Mobile Switching
Centers (MSCs) and of course VLR nodes, which either request information from the HLR
or update the information contained within the HLR. The HLR also initiates transactions
with VLRs to complete incoming calls and to update subscriber data.

Traditional wireless network design (anything before 1996) is based on the utilization
of a single Home Location Register (HLR) for each wireless network, but growth 
considerations are prompting carrier administrators to consider multiple HLR databases.

So what does that mean? It means our Telecommunications Industry is under pressure to
develop larger and faster networks in order to satisfy the needs of residential and
business customers.


'Visitor Location Register (VLR)'

A Visitor Location Register (VLR) is a database which contains temporary information
concerning the mobile customers (subscribers) that are currently located in a
given MSC (Mobile Switching Centre) serving area, but whose Home Location Register (HLR)
is elsewhere (out of range).

When a mobile subscriber roams away from his/her home location and into a remote location
(ie. digital to analog), SS7 messages are used to obtain information about the subscriber
from the HLR, and essentially create a temporary record for the subscriber in the VLR which
usually only has one per Mobile Switching Centre.


'International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) Number' 

"What the hell is IMSI?" - IMSI is a unique non-dialable number allocated to each mobile
subscriber in the GSM system that identifies the subscriber and his or her subscription
within the GSM network. Make sense yet?

The IMSI resides in the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), which is transportable across
Mobile Station Equipment (MSE) (look for IMSI being supported by the GPRS standard soon!)

The IMSI is made up of three important parts: 

#1: The Mobile Country Code (MCC)

#2. The Mobile Network Code (MNC) (they consist of 2 digits)

#3. The Mobile Subscriber Identity Number (MSIN) (they consist of 10 digits)



'Mobile Subscriber ISDN (MSISDN) Number'

The MSISDN is the dialable number that subscribers use to reach another mobile
subscriber. Some of the newer phones (ie. newer GSM supported Motorola, Nokia's)
in Canada and the U.S. support the up-to-date multiple MSISDNs which are now in 
affect.


'Mobile Station Equipment (MSE) Subscription Services'

GSM carriers typically order Mobile Station Equipment (MSE) (or GSM phones)
from their suppliers (Nokia, Motorola, Sony, etc.) in large quantities (e.g. 1000 Units).
After receiving an order, the equipment supplier will program the ordered MSE SIMs with a
range of IMSI numbers.



  GSM Call Routing --


 'Mobile Subscriber Roaming'

When a mobile subscriber roams into a new location area, the VLR automatically 
determines that it must update the HLR with the new location information, which it does
using an SS7 Location Update Request Message (LURM). The Location Update Message
is then routed to the HLR through the SS7 network, based on the global title translation
of the IMSI that is stored within the SCCP Called Party Address portion of the message.
The HLR responds with a message that informations the VLR whether the subscriber should
be provided services in the new location.

 
 'Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number (MSISDN) Call Routing'

When a user dials a GSM mobile subscriber's MSISDN, the PSTN routes the call
to the Home MSC based on the dialed telephone number. The MSC must then query
the HLR based on the MSISDN identification, to acquire routing information required
to route the call to the subscribers' current location.

The MSC stores sensitive global title translation tables that are used to determine
the HLR associated with the MSISDN. When only one HLR exists, the translation tables
are trivial. When more than one HLR is used however, the translations become extremely
challenging, with one translation record per subscriber (see the useful example below).
Havin determined the appropriate HLR address, the MSC sends a Routing Information Request
(RIR) to it.

Example:
--------
When the HLR receives the Routing Information Request, it "maps" the MSISDN to the IMSI,
and ascertains the subscribers' personal profile including the current VLR at which the
subscriber is registered. The HLR then queries the VLR for a Mobile Station Roaming Number
(MSRN). The MSRN is essentially an ISDN telephone number which the mobile subscriber can
be reached at. The MSRN is a temporary number that is valid ONLY for the duration of a 
single call. The HLR generates a response message, which includes the MSRN, and sends it
back across the SS7 network to the MSC. Finally, the MSC attempts to complete the call using
the MSRN provided.


  'Implementation of a second HLR to the GSM Network'

As a GSM wireless carrier's subscriber base grows, it will eventually become
necessary to add a second HLR to their network (obviously). This requirement might be
prompted by a Service Subscription Record Storage Capacity Issue (SSRSCI) or
perhaps an SS7 Message Processing Performance Issue (MPPI). It might possibly be prompted
by a need to increase the overall network reliability.

The new HLR can be populated with service subscription records as new subscribers are 
brought into service or existing service subscription records can be ported from the old
HLR to the new HLR to more evenly distribute the growing SS7 traffic load.
Usually, when new subscribers are brought into service, the second HLR will be populated
with blocks of IMSI numbers that are allocated when new MSE equipment is ordered.

Much more complicated SS7 message routing Global Title Translations are required
for Routing Information Request transactions between the MSCs distributed over the
entire wireless carrier serving area and the two or more HLRs. MSC Routing Information
Requests are routed to the appropriate HLR based on the dialed MSISDN and not the IMSI.

Unlike the IMSI numbers, the MSISDN numbers can not easily be arranged in groups to
reside within a single HLR and therefore, the MSC must contain an MSISDN to HLR 
address association record for every mobile subscriber homed on each of the MSCs.

'Conclusion'


This is the first of many SS7 related documents to be published for
Nettwerked / b0g / Hack Canada, which of course is a good thing because
there aren't enough people in the world writing about the SS7 protocol 
let alone home grown Canadians!

Look for an introductory SS7 paper soon.

Ok, now that you have all the materials, place the magnets on the car (or 
project box) ...
you can take off the body and tires and put it in a project box all nice like. 
Now turn on the car and radio and the magnets will fly. Fly the magnets towards 
that old lady, fly them in her panties. Now fly the panties back and your home 
free. If theres an old grandpa watchin her ass stick his cane up his urethra and 
put rocks up his ass. Now take your hat and sit on the sidewalk and whack off. 
Old ladies will come to see you whack off and will pay you, use the panties as
a sexual treat. 

*Second Method*

Use the force (if your not of the jedi warriors, analy rape yodas green ass and 
he will cooperate and will steal old ladies panties for you with the force)
Then you can e-mail me ( YourMom@Mybed.cum ) and tell me if yoda has a green or 
brown cock.

*Last Resortion*

As a last resortion, you can snare the old ladies panties. Tie some yarn to the 
old ladies panties and run around the corner, this works better if the old ladie 
is in one of them motorized carts (I like to think of them as moving beds). Now 
hide around the corner, and give the string a good yank. with luck u will have 
ripped the old ladies panties off. Now its home free home. 


UPDATES:

if u built that fucker u know it didnt work and you then either had to rape 
yoda (but he prolly inturn raped you so you didnt get anywhere) and instead had 
to use the yarn snare trick. Well this method sucks nuts so we will discuss 
reasons why the above method didnt work and how the new method works.

Q:How come the fuckin yarn breaks?
A:You prolly snatched it from the same gramma whom your gonna rob... them senile 
hotties dont know which shit is the good shit so just use other methods.

Q:You stupid fucks why did you publish shit that doesnt work?
A:Anyone who makes boxes are leet and its even leeter if you just read other 
text files and used the information there and write your own txt with out 
actually testing the shit...

Q:What are you mofos going to do aboot it?
A:Read on mofo!

I present...
the new method of stealing granny panntys!

It is a little known fact that older women's undergarments have certain
radio frequencys attached to them. we won't go in to detail about all
of these frequencys but in this text we will discuss one and that one 
is the old lady's panty frequency. the panty frequency is very difficult
to identify since the old lady's ass jiggles and so do her wrinkles and
hair so the tone coming from her panties at any particular time is 
"masked" if you will and must be singled out and amplified to get a 
good reading this text will describe the many ways me and my colleagues
have found to do this quickly and efficiently 

So.. how do we demodulate this masked frequency?
well first you got to get the fucking materials jackass

Materials:

1 Hot Old Lady(if your after ebony pleasures there will be a special method just 
for you)
1 Scanner(FCC regulations requires all scanners after 1994 to be modified so the 
old lady
undergarment frequency is not able to be scanned we will modify the scanner to 
pick up the
frequency.. more on that later)

2.6 gerbils(remove the claws and or limbs..)
1 egg beater(modified blender may work)
1 fat cocked nail..(rip the fucker out of your houses foundation)
1 pair of binoculars(IMPORTANT NOTE: do NOT substitute with monoculars)
19 car batteries fresh from the store
3 condoms(balloons will work as well)
lots of wire


First we need to modify the scanner to make it pick up the proper frequency 
(1337) open the case up to the scanner. Take the binoculars and peek into the 
windows of the old folks home. With the erection begin whacking off and 
ejaculate on the circuitry of the scanner.
When semen is mixed with the finger oils of them mother fucking japs it creates 
an acid that melts the proper electrolyctics. Now just because we can pick up 
the 1337 frequency doesnt mean fuck all for fuck all... the frequency is 
masked... the rest of the device will help us unmask the frequency.

Take the egg beater and put your condoms over the beaters while sticking the 
other in your ass.
Put the declawed gerbil in your ass (inside the condom). Now hook up the car 
batteries to the to the fucking egg beater in parallel (or series I forget which 
is which..) 
Now take the wire and wrap it around the egg beater and turn it on... so lots of 
fuckign wire is on the egg beaters... now with the remaining unraveled wire 
stick it in the gerbils ass so it pierces the cock suckers intestines and the 
wire comes out his mouth and pierces the condom. We want 6-8 feet of wire in our 
ass hole.

With the remaining condom, slap that fucker on your cock and put the nail in 
your urethra(inturn piercing the condom).Wrap wire around the nail and wrap the 
other end on the negative terminals to the batteries.

now what you need to do is smack your dick against the condom covered part of 
the egg beater do it to a disco rhythm. now this is not for the weak hearted 
your ass hairs will all fall out and your dick will feel like jello but when you 
see those old ladies panties floating in your door its all worth it. the tone 
that this contraption makes is 31337 Hz

If you do not know how this device works your obviously not familiar with 
quantum physics and basic electric magnetic fields. dumbass.

I will quote my partner in business pooly on this device

"well it creates what we in the business of aged female pantie sales as a
negative introversion of the granma panty fields and then the panties grow
more and more unstable and must even this out or become so other entity's 
undergarment since grammuh panties take much longer than required to reach
the panty drop zone to get familiar with a new host this is the perfect way 
to harvest panties"
Well said stinky nuts

So now while using this device.. if the disco music hasnt drained all the 
fucking amps out of your house circuitry you will hear the unmasked ass jigglage 
of an old lady.


When you obtain the panties.. you can use the above methods (using them as 
sexual treats.. etc)
Or you can store the panties for later.

Obtain some ziplock bags and freeze the panties.. this helps preserve the smell 
of her fucking dirty ass hairy white cunt.

Nigger panties:
Now, your either a sick fuck or your from the ghetto... regardless if you want 
some mofo panties they are fairly easy to require. Most mofo hoes have fat asses 
so the panties will be somewhat stressed out and the snare method 
afforementioned is very effective.

I do not recommend using the above contraption as you will be overwhelmed with 
floating gonch and the stench of nigger will affect your breathing.


Easy Part:
Ok now first walk down the street and find your target.. 

Hard Part: talk to the fucking nigger
Example conversations; "look bitch!" (pointing in the air)
"soo... how bout them knicks?" (all niggers play ball so this may be the most 
effective one)"mofo!"

Now that you've got her distracted stick your hand down her pants and rip the 
fuckers out and run.
Proceed to the nearest bathroom and clean your fucking hands before you gratify 
your self from your new found (stinky) treasure.


I hope you found this text informative...

 ____________________________________________________________________








Design and layout: wh0rde
Implementation and coding: wh0rde
Final production stage: wh0rde
Overview and editing: wh0rde
Idea, thought processes: wh0rde
Inspiration: Angelina Jolie, tak's mother

Idea: I thought it would be totally awesome if we just like hacked the planet 
dude. Think of it! We could like control shit and stuff with our computers! 
Wouldnt that just kick ass? We could dial into TV stations and control 
broadcasts, dial into banks to give ourselves all this money, we could capsize 
boats in the water, we could even download the entire contents of every /tmp 
directory and call it a garbage file! WOULDNT THAT FUCKING ROCK? Well I was 
sitting home smoking a big fat joint and came up with this idea: lets find a 
Gibson, and hack it, and just like totally own it, and once we did that we will 
have triggered something that makes us be able to hack the planet! Maybe we 
could even make some fuckin cool virus worm thing called Piccaso, or maybe 
Michaelangelo, or Da Vinci or something, to make it sound like we have artistic 
abilities!

Design: First we need to get a bunch of guber-elite people from shady 
underground hacking coffee-shops and give ourselves nicknames. I think Ill be 
wh0rde, since my nick is already wh0rde. I could find these other k-rad people 
like obsolete, bob, tak, prae, pac, grid, and niemand1 and have them join me! I 
could name obsolete "h4qR," bob could be "k4y r4d b0bby," tak could be "fUq-N-
MorMoNZ-R_uGLy," prae could be "b00typ1r4t3," pac could be "Z3r0 c00l," grid 
could be "p4q3t-f4gg0t," and niemand1 could be "s3r14l ch41nsm0q3r." Then we 
could go have elite hacker contests and harass police officers! Then when we got 
in trouble we would have an ace up our sleeves: the GIBSON! Ill code this thing 
g1bs0n.c where it randomly guesses passwords (with 100% accuracy) then downloads 
the /tmp directory. Wouldnt that be cool?

Implementation: Well first I started prank calling the police station, but they 
came over to my house and beat the shit out of my with their batons, and ripped 
out my telco box, so that didnt go too well. I then went over to obsolete's 
house and tried to wardial the entire area code for elite numbers to call up, 
but his mom came in and started bitching that we were wasting money and should 
just use the phone book, so we did and called up pizza hut and had them deliver 
100 pizzas with everything on them to his house, it was so funny! Then the 
pizzas came, which was weird, because theyre not supposed to do that, it was 
only a prank, and I tried to explain it to them but they kicked our asses and 
took obsolete's computer for the money they needed. We went over to bob's house 
and called up a bunch of gay porn lines to get them to call the police station, 
but the 900 numbers kept eating up money on the phone bill and bob was starting 
to talk to the guy operators and touching himself so me and obs left for tak's 
house. His mom answered the door and wanted to know if we wanted free head, but 
shes this nasty ugly thing so we just ran around back and yelled for tak to 
come out. He came out and we went over to prae's house, but his dad said he was 
busy "cleaning out my pipes" whatever that means, so we went to pacs house and 
chilled there. He had AOHELL so we were hacking a bunch of people on AOL, when I 
found this mailbomber and we started mailbombing people, which was elite. We 
found this guy in private room "Gibson" with a gibson, so we used telnet.exe and 
connected to him, and somehow we kept guessing account and one that we guessed 
"aDnDNfdeEzE*3j^ajdjsdfnmSAD" with password 
"asdfsdSDJFSDsdfhktherWE35123%9snj3s" worked, so we went to the /tmp directory 
and downloaded all this stuff to our 0hday ftp server which had AOHELL on it. We 
found out that this guy stole our idea for the virus and was using it to steal 
all this money, because in the tmp directory there was this file "note-to-self" 
which said:

---------note-to-self----------------------------
Note to self:

Dont tell anyone about super secret virus that takes the companies money and 
sticks it in the Cuban bank with account number 2352352353135233.

Also: call up tak's mom.. damn she gives good head
---------note-to-self----------------------------

So now what do we do. Well, we hack the planet! This dudes obviously hacked the 
planet first, so we have to hack the planet FROM him.

Procedure: We go on IRC into #hackphreak, #cha0s, #hackers, and #linuxsex and 
drop this guys docs. Everyone logs in and runs their own elite viruses that do 
funky stuff like eat stuff and have sex with each other. Then, soon the Gibson 
cant handle all the processes and crashes, thereby hacking the planet from this 
guy, killing his virus, and getting the money! Hell yeah! Only problem is that 
we dont have enough elite programs, so we have to write some. First we'll go 
with the "replicating" or fuckmonkey program. Save it as fuckmonkey.pl and chmod 
+x it.

#!/bin/bash/perl
$blah = cos(3.35235233);
while( 1 ); {
$blah=cos($blah);
`~/fuckmonkey.pl' }
#---end---#

Now just run that sucker on the Gibson (assuming it has perl installed). Hack 
the planet! So now that we crashed the Gibson and took over the bank account 
(long unnecessary story involving tak giving a lot of head), were rich and 
sitting on top of the world. I dont want to bore you with the whole taking over 
the government etc thing, the main point is we hacked the Gibson, now we own the 
world. Of course bullies still kick bob's ass but thats a different story 
entirely.

  Introduction.

 Sniffing and spoofing are security threats that target the
lower layers of the networking infrastructure supporting
applications that use the Internet. Users do not interact
directly with these lower layers and are typically
completely unaware that they exist. Without a deliberate
consideration of these threats, it is impossible to build
effective security into the higher levels.

 Sniffing is a passive security attack in which a machine
separate from the intended destination reads data on a
network. The term "sniffing" comes from the notion of
"sniffing the ether" in an Ethernet network and is a bad
pun on the two meanings of the word "ether."
Passive security attacks are those that do not alter the
normal flow of data on a communication link or inject data
into the link.

 Spoofing is an active security attack in which one machine
on the network masquerades as a different machine. As an
active attack, it disrupts the normal flow of data and may
involve injecting data into the communications link between
other machines. This masquerade aims to fool other machines
on the network into accepting the impostor as an original,
either to lure the other machines into sending it data or
to allow it to alter data. The meaning of 'spoof' here is
not 'a lighthearted parody,' but rather 'a deception intended
to trick one into accepting as genuine something that is
fake.' Such deception can have grave consequences because
notions of trust are central to many networking systems.
Sniffing may seem innocuous (depending on just how sensitive
and confidential you consider the information on your network),
some network security attacks use sniffing as a prelude to
spoofing. Sniffing gathers sufficient information to make
the deception believable.

  Sniffing.

 Sniffing is the use of a network interface to receive data
not intended for the machine in which the interface resides.
A variety of type of machines need to have this capability.
A token-ring bridge, for example, typically has two network
interfaces that normally receives all packets travelling on
the media on one interface and retransmit some, but not all,
of these packets on the other interface. Another example of
a device that incorporates sniffing is one typically marketed
as a 'network analyzer.' A network analyzer helps network
administrators diagnose a variety of obscure problems that
may not be visible on any one particular host. These problems
can involve unusual interactions between more than just one
or two machines and sometimes involve a variety of protocols
interacting in strange ways.

 Devices that incorporate sniffing are useful and necessary.
However, their very existence implies that a malicious person
could use such a device or modify an existing machine to
snoop on network traffic. Sniffing programs could be used to
gather passwords, read inter-machine e-mail, and examine 
clien-server database records in transit. Besides these high
level data, lowlevel information might be used to mount an
active attack on data in another computer system.

  Sniffing: How It Is Done.

 In a shared media network, such as Ethernet, all network
interfaces on a network segment have access to all the data 
that travels on the media. Each network interface has a 
hardware-layer address that should differ from all hardware-layer 
addresses of all other network interfaces on the network. Each 
network also has at least on broadcast address that corresponds 
not to an individual network interface, but to the set of all 
network interfaces. Normally, a network interface will only 
respond to a data frame carrying either its own hardware-layer 
address in the frame's destination field or the 'broadcast address'
in the destination field. It responds to these frames by generating 
a hardware interrupt to the CPU. This interrupt gets that attention 
of the operating system, and passes the data in the frame to the 
operating system for further processing.

 At times, you may hear network administrators talk about their
networking troubles spots---when they observe failures in a 
localized area. They will say a particular area of the Ethernet 
is busier than other areas of the Ethernet where there are no 
problems. 
All of the packets travel through all parts of the Ethernet segment. 
Interconnection devices that do not pass all the frames from one side 
of the device to the other form the boundaries of a segment. Bridges, 
switches, and routers divide segments from each other, but low-level 
devices that operate on one bit at a time, such as repeaters and hubs,
do not divide segments from each other. If only low-level devices 
separate two parts of the network, both are part of a single segment. 
All frames travelling in one part of the segment also travel in the 
other part.

 The broadcast nature of shared media networks effects network
performance and reliability so greatly that networking professionals
use a network analyzer, or sniffer, to troubleshoot problems.
A sniffer puts a network interface in promiscuous mode so that
the sniffer can monitor each data packet on the network segment.
In the hands of an experienced system administrator, a sniffer
is an invaluable aid in determining why a network is behaving
(or misbehaving) the way it is. With an analyzer, you can determine
how much of the traffic is due to which network protocols, which
hosts are the source of most of the traffic, and which hosts are
the destination of most of the traffic. You can also examine data
travelling between a particular pair of hosts and categorize it by
protocol and store it for later analysis offline. With a sufficiently
powerful CPU, you can also do the analysis in real time.

 Most commercial network sniffers are rather expensive, costing
thousands of dollars. When you examine these closely, you notice
that they are nothing more than a portable computer with an Ethernet
card and some special software. The only item that differentiates
a sniffer from an ordinary computer is software. It is also easy to
download software and freeware sniffing software from the Internet
or various bulleting board systems.

 The ease of access to sniffing software is great for network
administrators because this type of software helps them become better
network troubleshooters. However, the availability of this software
also means that malicious computer users with access to a network
can capture all the data flowing through the network. The sniffer
can capture all the data for a short period of time or selected
portions of the data for a fairly long period of time. Eventually,
the malicious user will run out of space to store the data---the
network I use often has 1000 packets per second flowing on it.
Just capturing the first 64 bytes of data from each packet fills
up my system's local disk space within an hour.

  Sniffing Passwords.

 Perhaps the most common loss of computer privacy is the loss of
passwords. Typically users type a password at least once a day.
Data is often thought of as secure because access to it requires
a password. Users usually are very careful about guarding their
password by not sharing it with anyone and not writing it down
anywhere.

 Passwords are used not only to authenticate users for access to
the files they keep in their private accounts but other passwords
are often employed within multilevel secure database systems. 
When the user types any of these passwords, the system does not
echo them to the computer screen to ensure that no one will see
them. After jealously guarding these passwords and having the
computer system reinforce the notion that they are private, a
setup that sends each character in a password across the network
is extremely easy for any Ethernet sniffer to see. End users
do not realize just how easily these passwords can be found
by someone using a simple and common piece of software.

  Sniffing Financial Account Numbers.

 Most users are uneasy about sending financial account numbers,
such as credit card numbers and checking account numbers, over
the Internet. This apprehension may e partly because of the
carelessness most retailers display when tearing up or returning
carbons of credit card receipts. The privacy of each user's credit
card numbers is important. Although the Internet is by no means
bulletproof, the most likely location for the loss of privacy
to occur is at the endpoints of the transmission. Presumably,
businesses making electronic transactions are as fastidious about
security as those that make paper transactions, so the highest
risk probably comes from the same local network in which the
users are typing the passwords.

 However, much larger potential losses exist for businesses that
conduct electronic funds transfer or electronic document interchange
over a computer network. These transactions involve the transmission
of account numbers that a sniffer could pick up; the thief could
then transfers funds into his or her own account or order goods
paid by a corporate account. Most credit card fraud of this kind
involves only a few thousand dollars per incident.

  Sniffing Private Data.

 Loss of privacy is also common in e-mail transactions. Many e-mail
messages have been publicized without the permission of the sender
or receiver. Remember the Iran-Contra affair in which President
Reagan's secretary of defence, Caspar Weinberger, was convicted.
A crucial piece of evidence was backup tapes of PROFS e-mail on
a National Security Agency computer. The e-mail was not intercepted
in transit, but in a typical networked system, it could have been.
It is not at all uncommon for e-mail to contain confidential business
information or personal information. Even routine memos can be
embarrassing when they fall into the wrong hands.

  Sniffing Low-Level Protocol Information.

 Information network protocols send between computers includes 
hardware addresses of local network interfaces, the IP address of 
remote network interfaces, IP routing information, and sequence 
numbers assigned to bytes on a TCP connection. Knowledge of any of 
this information can be misused by someone interested in attacking the 
security of machines on the network.
A sniffer can obtain any of these data. After an attacker has this 
kind of information, he or se is in a position to turn a passive 
attack into an active attack wit even greater potential for damage.

  Protocol Sniffing: A Case Study.

 At one point in time, all user access to computing facilities in the
organization under study (the university at which the author is 
employed) was done via terminals. It was not practical to hardwire 
each terminal to the host, and users needed to use more than one host. 
To solve these two problems, Central Computing used a switch (an AT&T 
ISN switch) between the terminals and the hosts. The terminals 
connected to the switch so that the user had a choice of hosts. When 
the user chose a host to switch connected the terminal to the chosen 
host via a very real, physical connection. The switch had several 
thousands ports and was, in theory, capable of setting up connections 
between any pair of ports. In practical, however, some ports attached 
to terminals and other ports attached to hosts.

 To make the system more flexible, the central computing facility was 
changed to a new system that uses a set of (DEC 550) Ethernet terminal 
servers with ports connected to the switch, rather than the old 
system, which used a fixed number of switch ports connected to each 
host. The new terminal servers are on an Ethernet segment by the hosts 
in the central machine room.

 Offices have a cable running from a wallplate to a wiring closet 
punchdown block. The punchdown block has cables running to 
multiplexers which turn connect to the switch. The multiplexers serve 
to decrease the number of cables that need to be long. With this 
arrangement sniffing or other form of security problems are not an 
issue. No two offices share any media.
The switch mediates all interaction between computers, isolating the 
flow of data away from the physical location of the end users.

 Rather than using simple terminals, however, most computer users have 
a computer on their desktop that they use in addition to the Central 
Computing computers. The switch services these computers as well as 
simple terminals. The number of computer users, however, has grown 
rapidly over the past decade and the switch is no longer adequate. 
Terminal ports are in short supply, host ports are in even shorter 
supply, and the switch does not supply particularly high-speed 
connections.

 To phase out the switch, Central Computing installed an Ethernet hub 
in the basement of each building next to the punchdown block used to 
support both the switch multiplexer and the telephone lines. The hubs 
in the basement connect to the central facility using fiber-optic 
cables to prevent signal degradation over long distances. Hubs also 
were placed in the wiring closets on each floor of each building that 
connected to the basement hub. Now the cables leading to the 
wallplates in the offices are being moved from the punchdown block 
that leads to the multiplexer to a punchdown block that leads to one 
of these hubs. The new wiring scheme neatly parallels the old and was 
changed relatively inexpensively.

 Although the new wiring scheme neatly parallels the old, the data 
travelling on the new wiring scheme does not neatly parallel its 
previous path. From a logical standpoint, it can get to the same 
places, but the data can and does go to many other places as well. 
Under this scheme, any office can sniff on all the data flowing to 
Central Computing from all of the other offices in the building. 
Different departments are located in the same building. These
departments compete for resources allocated by uppermanagers that 
supervise them, and middle management all are located in the same 
building. A fair amount of potential exists for employees to want to 
know what other people are sending in e-mail messages, storing in 
personnel files, and storing in project planning files.

 In addition to nosiness and competition, a variety of people sharing 
the same physical media in the new wiring scheme, could easily misuse 
the network. Since all occupants of a building share a single set of 
Ethernet hubs, they broadcast all of their network traffic to every 
network interface in the entire building. Any sensitive information 
that they transmit is no longer limited to a direct path between 
user's machine and the final destination, anyone in the building can 
intercept the information with a sniffer. However, some careful 
planning of network installation or a redesign of an existing
network should include security considerations (as well as performance 
issues) to avoid the risks inherent in shared media networking.

 The network in the case study fails miserably in the prevention of 
sniffing. Any computer in a building is capable of sniffing the 
network traffic to or from any other computer in the building.

  Feedback would be nice <psyops@phault.org>.

Foreword

Welcome back to the final installment of the Teenage Mutant Nigger Turtles 
miniseries. We last left off with our two remaining turtles being shoved into 
the trunk of Jerry Curl's buick and being hauled off to his plantation. Let's 
get back to the action..

Teenage Mutant Nigger Turtles

They're the world's most trashy, scumbag team (We're really hip!)
They're niggers in a half-shell, they're not clean (Hey - get a grip!)
When the evil ShitNigga attacks
These Turtle boys shoot him in the back!

Turtle power!


Scene 4 - Jerry Curl's Plantation

Coonatello and LowRideO look around in horror as they see thousands of blackies 
working on the plantation. Their huge lips hang below their chin as they stare 
open mouthed at the operation. Suddenly a a set of hands grips each of their 
shoulders like vice clamps. They spin around and stare up at the biggest 
creatures they have ever seen.

Jerry Curl: Ah, I see you've met 8-ball and Crackbaby. They'll be making sure 
you keep up your end of the bargin. If not..

As his voice trails off, the two monsters bring out a set of whips lined with 
sharp pieces of metal. 

Jerry Curl: ..If not, we'll have to punish you. Of course, I'll have to seperate 
you two, I don't need anyone causing any trouble. LowRideO - You'll be taking 
the west side of the plantation and Coonatello will be taking the east side.

Immediately, as if some sort of power had over taken them, Coonatello and 
LowRideO began to feud on who's side was better.

LowRideO: West Siiiiiide!

Coonatello: East Siiiideeee, motha fucka!

Laughing, Jerry Curl orders his goons to take them away.

4 hours later...

Too tired to work any further, LowRideO sits down to catch his breath. A sound 
of thunder breaks the erie silence. Then, he's hit with a slicing pain on his 
back. The whip, he thought in agony. 8-ball's distorted face appears over 
LowRideO. Suddenly, they are both cast in shadow. 

<THWACK!>

8-ball is thrown to the ground by a tremendous force. In surprise, he lets out a 
snort and glances up in the hot sun. He sees a slightly out of shape, older man, 
with the word 'b0g' on his tight spandex outfit, staring down at him. 

8-ball: Duhh.. duh.. Super Bob! Duh.. I'm sorry, is dees your friends? 

Super Bob: That's right, now step aside you pussy. I have work to do. 

Super Bob lifts LowRideO off the ground and zooms into the air.

Super Bob: Let's go save Coonatello and get out of here.

As Bob draws nearer to the East side of the plant, the sun does likewise with 
the horizon. Twisted, contorted shadows align the plant's features, casting many 
things in blackness.

Super Bob: Have no fear! I have super b0g vision!

Navigating his way around like it was daylight, Bob easily locates Coonatello 
and lands to the ground with a thud. 

Coonatello: Bob? You came and saved me after what happened with us..

Super Bob: Yes, you didn't thing I'd leave you here, did y--

<THUD>

Bob is suddenly clubbed in the head with a heavy object. Shakily, he whips 
around to see Crackbaby holding a rock (boulder might be the correct word here) 
in his hands. Bob stands up, and smiles at Crackbaby. 

Super Bob: Dare you challenge my b0g powers? Dear boy.. you've messed with the 
wrong person.

Bob grabs on to Crackbaby's testicles and rips them away.

<slurp>

All of a sudden, Crackbaby emits an ear piercing (high pitched) scream. He then 
falls to the ground with blood gushing from his extremities.

The lights on the plant turn on in sequence to the event, and Jerry Curl's voice 
occupies the megaphone.

Jerry Curl: You have 10 seconds to return to your work before the dogs are 
released. I repeat, you have 10 seconds.. before you are ripped to shreds.

Super Bob: I call that move the Super b0g ball buster. 

LowRideO: Thanks bob, I owe you one.

Coonatello: Yeah me too..

Coonatello: Oh, and LowRideO man, sorry for fighting earlier

(Jerry Curl: 4.. 3..)

LowRideO: It's okay man, lets get the fuck out of here.

With a wink, Bob lifts Coonatello and LowRideO high into the air, and they zoom 
away high above the plant just as the dogs are released.

With that, Bob drops them both to their doom. 

With a wide grin, he calls out as they are being ripped to shreds by the dogs..

Super Bob: Next time.. don't steal my issue of b0g you fuckers!


And so ends the adventures of the Teenage Mutant Nigger Turtles. Hope you 
enjoyed it.

Author's Note: These two articles were in no way meant to offend black people. I

=============================================================================
=============================================================================
The next day, Warnerbros chat was patched, and I no longer had admin.
But boy was this fun. I still have admin to a chat that caters to 12 year olds,
but I don't think I'll catch them cybering any time soon.

You can hear that pretty often these days as Prae is an 31337 h4x0r 
and he'll root you in just a second.
This guide is meant to help Linux and Internet newbies to avoid not 
getting hacked by this hack-est , the Emperor of the Hackers , the guy 
that can root you with only a spoon and a peach-leaf , his Majesty 
Prae from b0g. Here is a log with what I do every time I reinstall 
Linux on my box that was NEVER hacked by Prae (and will never be as I 
IRC spoofed cuz Im lame)
Following these lines step by step will totally secure you and Prae 
won't , for sure , root you.

        Ok, so you have something important written down on a piece of paper, but 
you don't know where to hide it (password, phone number, message ect.). Get a 
3.5" floppy disk (Definition for the computer illiterate: The little square disk 
you put into your computer) and take a small thin flat-head screw driver and 
carefully take off the metal slide on the disk by putting the screw driver in 
the space between the two halves of the plastic cover and just pop it off. Now 
carefully pry the two halves of the disk apart. Now take out the disk media 
(Definition for the computer illiterate: The round plastic thing with the metal 
piece in it). Now look at the half of the disk casing with the hole in it (as 
shown below). Where it says "Tape Paper Here" tape you message, number, 
password, ect on a piece of paper. Always tape above the hole or you will be 
able to see the paper on the outside of the disk.

 _________________
|                 |
| Tape Paper Here |
|                 |
|      /---\      |
|      |   |      |
|      \---/      |
|                     |
|         |-|         |
|         | |         |
|_______|_|_______|


        Now put the disk media back and snap the disk back together. Now take a 
disk label and instead of putting it on the front of the disk, fold about 1/3 of 
it over the top seam of the disk as to act like a hinge whenever you need to 
open it. Then slide the metal piece back onto the disk and there you have it! 
Now to open it just take of the metal piece and flip it open!

        This works well for remembering your passwords and also passing messages 
to fellow ninja hackers :-)

 ____________________________________________________________________






         WTF is crackomedia?  Crackomedia is my own version of 
cracking Macromedia products.  Macromedia have came up with 
this gay shit call Electronic Software Distribution.  What it 
basically is that you download their software and you'll get a 30 days 
trial period.  After that, if you want it, you get buy it directly 
through the software and they give you this key code so you'll get the 
full version.  Basically, I am no beans against Macromedia but I 
do really hate them for setting their software so high price... I 
mean a fucking Macromedia Authorwave for $2,713.99 US... 
what a fucking rip off.

          Okay.  For all ya wannabe l33t crackers out there who 
really want to crack all kinds of Macromedia software, Here is 
what ya do.  



          1.  Download any copy of Macromedia Software

          2.  Run the program and go to buy

3. Fill it all those junks with bullshits and click next
    twice

          4.  You be ask you enter your credit card # and shit.  

Select Visa, and for credit card, put 16 "0's" and fill in the 
information with Bullshit.

          5.  After that, click cancel and exit to quit the program.



********** WTF?!!? QUIT!! YOU FUCKING KRAZY!! ********* 

     
          6.  Go to c:\windows if you 0wn win9x or c:\winnt for 
              win2k and NT users

          7.  Find a configuration file call rsagent

          8.  Open it with notepad and edit the line                 
              mailStat-391842=0
              to
              mailStat-391842=1

          9.  Then save it.

         10.  Open the Macromedia Software again and it goes to a 
freaking thing where you're going to get your S/N from mail.  
There, you use "YHBIFXYXSC" as the unlock key code.  After 
use it again as the Serial Number.



Then it'll say your software is being pepeare and bla bla bla.....
After youre prompt with a thingy where you put your 
organization shits, Company and your serial Number.  Try to fill 
it in if you want but is useless.  You still haven't complete 
cracked the Macromedia Software!!!


Now! I hope you didn't delete the installation program to install 
your Macromedia program, because you'll need it.  


Okay anyway. reinstall it again.  After you done reinstalling,  run 
the Macromedia program and it'll go "Being pepper and blabla
THEN BOOM!!! The gay Trial period Electronic Software 
Distribution is gone and the software is yours without being 
annoyed and hurting your wallet.  


I cracked Flash4, Dreamweaver UltraDev and Firework 3 with my 
Crackomedia method.  So enjoy it.


If some people want to bust their l33t programming skills and 
make a crack using this method, please do gimme so credit.  


                             No Applause Please :)


                             O 
                             |/  ___O OOOOOOOHHHHH" 
                             |--|   \ 
                             |  |

Are you sick of your friends telnetting over your brand Linux box and
"heh"-ing when they see that you have a RedHat and especially if it's a
buggy one? Well .. here is how you can replace your RedHat Linux with a
brand new one distro in just 30 secs.

1) Log in as root.

2) Make this phile called whatever you desire and taken from below with
the famous copy&paste >:>
Let's say you create it in /etc and you call it "initver"

# pico /etc/initver



3) Think of a really cool name. For example "Puffy Linux" (You might as
well use "b0g Linux" but , heh , who'd believe that there's a coder at
b0g) . I'll stick at "Puffy Linux" version 3.5 , you can use whatever you
want.


--cut here-- 

#!/bin/bash
echo > /etc/redhat-release 
echo "Puffy Linux release 3.5 (Cheese)" >> /etc/redhat-release
cp -f /etc/redhat-release /etc/issue

# Next .. for the kernel . The latest kernel at this moment that i'm
# writing is 2.4.0-test1 . So ... :

echo "Kernel 2.4.0-test1 on an i786" >> /etc/issue
echo >> /etc/issue
cp -f /etc/issue /etc/issue.net

--stop cutting , dork--

You might as well replace "i686" with "alpha" >:>
This phile , in case you haven't figured out yet , replaces that nasty
telnet banner with one made by YOU .
As damn RedHat rewrites it at every boot , we have to make sure that our
replacement will be made last.
For this you have to add it in /etc/rc.d/rc.local for example. So ..

# chmod +x /etc/initver
# echo "/etc/initver" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

6) Now reboot , you'll have a pleasant surprise. Or you'll OS will be
totally fucked up >:/ 

P.S. : nmap WILL detect it right , morons . So , if your friends are eleet
, this method won't do

Note: you need an internal PC speaker for this to work on your computer,
otherwise nothing will happen and it will just be damn boring.

Here is my program:

'Funny Sounds By: niemand1 4/27/2000
CLS
DO
  frequency% = RND * 1000
  IF frequency% < 37 THEN frequency% = 37
  duration% = 1
  SOUND frequency%, duration%
LOOP UNTIL INKEY$ = CHR$(27)
END

What it does:

CLS (clears text from DOS)
DO (Begins a loop process)
frequency% = RND * 1000 (Makes a random number between 1 and 1000)
IF frequency% < 37 THEN frequency% = 37 (I'll explain this later)
duration% = 1 (Value can be changed to make each sound longer)
SOUND frequency%, duration% (Plays a sound of specified freq. and dur.)
LOOP UNTIL INKEY$ = CHR$(27) (Loops until esc key is pressed)
END

This program makes a random number between 1 and 1000 and uses that number
as a frequency to play through the computers PC speaker, then repeats the
process until you hit the esc key.  When run it makes a ton of annoying 
sounds that might drive your parents insane, when they start yelling, hit
the esc key so you are not hit in the face. What can you do with this
program? I have no fucking clue, but I just think it's a funny way to learn
the sound command. 

The reason for the fourth line is this:

If you try to play a sound in a frequency lower than 37 the program craps up
because the computer won't allow sounds of those low frequencys. Why? I have
no idea, but if you figure it out, e-mail me at niemand1@hotmail.com. 

You can change the value of the third line to do make lower
frequency sounds only, or change it to as high as 32,767. If you set it for
32.767, you might get some high pitched sounds that annoy the hell out of
animals sensitive to noise, not recommended to dog owners. If you set it for
any higher than 32,767, the program will crap up because your computer
can't handle sounds any higher pitched than that. 

You can change the value of duration% to make the short sounds play longer,
but it does not sound as funny. 

Oh yeah, one more thing:

I made this program messed up on 240 miligrams of DXM in case you were 
wondering where I get psychotic ideas like this. I thought it was pretty 
damn funny while I was tripping and saved it.

The Interview of a lifetime 
(with a dude that claims to be a former member of Global Hell):

Note: I am not this stupid! This is for your enjoyment!

[21:39]  Mclark is ~matt@dsl-64-34-123-253.telocity.com
[21:39]  Mclark is «Matt Clark»
[21:39]  Mclark on Baltimore.MD.US.Undernet.Org

This would be me.

IRC log started Fri Jun 23 20:22
-> *scott-* Excuse me, I'm from a magazine, and was wondering if you would 
participate in an interview?
*Scott-* First off do you know who i am?
*Scott-* second of all what kind of magizine?
-> *scott-* I was told by some people from #hackphreak to talk to you, and its a 
small computer magazine.
*Scott-* Do you know who i am?
-> *scott-* No, I'm sorry?
*Scott-* No, its okay just don't want people knowing who i am.
*Scott-* Okay what kind of questions will i be asked?
-> *scott-* The secretive type huh?
*Scott-* and whats the magizine called and will i get a copy?
*Scott-* Im not allowed to be on here as it is
-> *scott-* Just some opinion questions, its called Computer Currents, and if 
you would like a free subscription you can have one.
-> *scott-* Be on where? Online?
*Scott-* yes, online.
-> *scott-* Are you in trouble with someone?
*Scott-* Im not in the possition to discuss anything.
-> *scott-* Ok, well would it be ok to conduct the interview?
*Scott-* sure..
-> *Scott-* The first thing in the column is I need a small introduction, how 
old you are, what state maybe, how many years you have been using computers, 
etc.
*Scott-* Im 18, I live in florida at the moment moving tuesday, ive been using 
computers for about 6 maybe 7 years now.
*Scott-* Im also a network admin but can't get online lol.
-> *scott-* Would it be ok to use your nickname?
*Scott-* yeah
-> *scott-* The next question is what computer platform you prefer, and a short 
description why you chose that one?
*Scott-* just put Scott
-> *scott-* Sure thing
*Scott-* I like linux very easy not all this grafical innerface stuff
*Scott-* just plain console
-> *scott-* Hah, very professional!
-> *scott-* What kind of network do you administer?
*Scott-* Linux Slackware 7.0 and Windows Server 2000
*Scott-* Windows Server 2000 is bullshit from what i have seen.
-> *scott-* Ok, now on to the opinions, if you don't want to answer just say no 
comment.
*Scott-* Okay..
-> *scott-* What do you think of the state of the nation's computer security? 
Many hundreds of government computers have recently been attacked and they are 
looking for young help, is this a good idea?
*Scott-* Yes i do like for an example ive actually been offerd a job with the 
goverment.
-> *scott-* Would it be ok to ask what part?
*Scott-* OSI - Office of Secret Investigations also Netowkr admin jobs on 
goverment computers.
*Scott-* err Network
-> *scott-* Very cool!
-> *scott-* Next question is what about DoS, what can we do to prevent it?
*Scott-* There isn't much we can do about it, People can gain access into 
machines that have alot of bandwidth and im sorry there is no server gonna stay 
up with people having access to this kind of bandwidth.
-> *scott-* Is the FBI's idea of a DDoS anti-tool a good one or is it just 
something to get others off their backs?
*Scott-* Seriously i think its something to get people off there backs, to many 
machines with bandwidth the servers are going to die.
-> *scott-* Has your network ever come under the attack of a DoS flood?
*Scott-* Many times, punks these days.
-> *scott-* I saw you were in the channel "lpsg," is this is a hacking 
organization? (I will remove the name in the article)
*Scott-* No its just a big joke called Large Penis Support Group
-> *scott-* Ok, Ill remove that one, not very relevant.
-> *scott-* Do you consider yourself a hacker?
*Scott-* no kidding we talk about viagra on the website
*Scott-* No and never will be one.
-> *scott-* If you were to term yourself as something, what would it e?
-> *scott-* Sorry, Be.
*Scott-* Always consider myself a person that has enough knowledge to get 
himself by
*Scott-* I don't consider myself anything..
-> *scott-* Just a couple questions to show general knowledge to my readers, can 
you define MAC?
*Scott-* Well explain first of all which MAC there are programs called MAC there 
are OS's called MAC machines called MAC
*Scott-* i mean alot of things so you need to specify which MAC you wanting me 
to define.
-> *scott-* Specifically MAC addresses
-> *scott-* As related to networking
*Scott-* ahh...
*Scott-* Actually if you don't mind i really don't even want to go into 
networking go into exploiting and diffrent things in that nature.
*Scott-* if you don't mind
-> *scott-* Well how about CSMA/CD?
*Scott-* hold on im going to get you refrences im going to send you a big file 
of shit ive wrote on sorts of things, sattilites, networking, phreaking
*Scott-* things like that..
-> *scott-* Ok
*Scott-* My networking text was from when i was with gH.
-> *scott-* You were a member of the infamous gH?
*Scott-* yes sir i was.
-> *scott-* Were you raided by the FBI?
*Scott-* i was on CNN 2 times
*Scott-* Yes sir i was raided 2 times.
*Scott-* I was on MSNBC once
*Scott-* and ABC in the morning once
-> *scott-* You were interviewed?
*Scott-* Many times also had TV Reports at my house.
*Scott-* ask mindphasr mosthated diesl0w anybody from them who i am, they will 
tell you..
-> *scott-* So you're quite a famous person I've stumbled on! This is very 
interesting!
*Scott-* famuos no i don't consider it that.
-> *scott-* Can we go back to some networking basics though? I always try to 
show to what degree network adminstrators are educated.
*Scott-* I consider it paying for what ive done.
*Scott-* Networking Basic's are alot more simpler them are kinda hard questions 
im trying to remember from my Network+ class.
-> *Scott-* Oh I'm sorry I thought you were a network adminsitrator?
*Scott-* Yes im a network admin just started though
*Scott-* lol
*Scott-* just getting my certs and just got me a job at synergy networks.
*Scott-* blank out synergy
-> *scott-* Oh ok, do you know what a MAC address or what CSMA/CD is?
-> *scott-* Sure
-> *scott-* And what Certifications are you applying for?
*Scott-* MCSE, Network+, finished my A+
*Scott-* Server 2000
-> *scott-* Very nice
*Scott-* but i could be wrong
*Scott-* but
*Scott-* is it
*Scott-* media access control?
*Scott-* or someshit
-> *scott-* Yes! Thats exactly right actually
*Scott-* dood its been awhile
*Scott-* heh
-> *scott-* And CSMA/CD?
*Scott-* ermm i remember the last half but not the first let me think
-> *scott-* Sure take your time
*Scott-* what magazine is this?
-> *scott-* Computer Currents
*Scott-* CSMA/CD has to do with ethernet currect?
-> *scott-* Yes, do you know what it stands for?
*Scott-* something like Carriers Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detections or 
some bs
*Scott-* thats problable way off
-> *scott-* Its very close
*Scott-* ahh
*Scott-* is it Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection ?
*Scott-* i cant remember if theres multiples or not
-> *scott-* Yes that is one version of it
-> *scott-* Now for some easy questions, do you know what 10base2 and 1base5 are
*Scott-* ethernet cards..
*Scott-* correct?
-> *scott-* Yep
-> *scott-* Want to try for a harder one?
*Scott-* sure
-> *scott-* Do you know what the purpose of SQE test signals are? In relations 
to AUI-based equipment?
*Scott-* wow.. i think i know this one actually man this shit needs to hit me 
though ugh..
-> *scott-* Sure
*Scott-* Theyre denial of service attacks based on AUI packets sent in a 
repetitive fashion until the machine's processor basically melts
*Scott-* or something close to that if i recall
-> *scott-* Wow, thats great!
*Scott-* dood if you can't tell im kinda slow i got a bad memory heh takes me 
awhile to think.
-> *scott-* Do you know what BNC networking is?
-> *scott-* No its fine, really youre doing great
*Scott-* okay there again i know of 2 BNC'ing
-> *scott-* In relation to networking
*Scott-* theres BNC you setup to bounce of another machine on a port to give 
yourself another IP getting onto another network
-> *scott-* Actually just spit out both I guess

Now during the interview me and hst were talking, since I saw hst knew that I 
was talking with Scott-, because in #lpsg Scott- put this:

[20:42] (@Scott-): CSMA/CD
[20:42] (@Scott-): wtf is this kid on
[20:42] (@Scott-): wtf is that bs?

Now heres what I could recover of the logs of me and hst talking:

[20:51] (hst): HEh

[20:51] (hst): i did
[20:52] (wh0rde): yeah

[20:58] (wh0rde): yes!
[20:58] (wh0rde): dont retell csma/cd though
[20:58] (wh0rde): hes gonna ask What is the purpose of the SQE test signal 
provided on AUI-based equipment?
[20:59] (wh0rde): tell him its denial of service or something
[20:59] (hst): omg
[20:59] (hst): this is so fucking funny
[20:59] (hst): you have to give me the logs of this
[20:59] (hst): right after you are done

a repetitive fashion until the machine's processor basically melts
[21:01] (hst): EHh

[21:01] (hst): would you like to know the real purpose
[21:01] (hst): or do you already know?
[21:01] (wh0rde): I have no idea
