Hello obsolete reporting again for another wonderful article to be 
featured in a b0g!@#! magazine. My anus is still a little sore from 
them chain mail fairies who came in and sodomized me for not 
forwarding chain letters. (See issue #3) Well anyway now that I have 
taken care of my hemorrhoids, I have decided to talk to you about 
Religion. Yes I know it is a touchy subject but for Christ sake so is 
anything these days. You can't even say, "Hey baby nice set of 
hooters," to a chick without getting a sexual harassment suit filed 
against your ass, then you're taken on Judge Judy and embarrassed in 
front of your friends, and family, and that dumb bitch, I just wanted 
to touch 'em, or play with 'em or something, and Judge Judy called me 
a pervert, so I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet, 
and then I finally settled the score with that bitch equally, I took 
her ass on Jerry Springer, and beat her ass legally and.....Umm yeah 
back to the religion thing. Well I have broken it down kind of simply. 
First mans favorite drink... BEER, and why it's better than Jesus.

    Top 10 Reasons Why Beer Is Better Than Jesus

10. No one will kill you for not drinking Beer.
9.  Beer doesn't tell you how to have sex.
8.  Beer has never caused a major war.
7.  They don't force Beer on minors who can't think for themselves.
6.  When you have a Beer, you don't knock on people's doors trying to
    give it away.
5.  Nobody's ever been burned at the stake, hanged, or tortured over
    his  brand of Beer.
4.  You don't have to wait 2000+ years for a second Beer.
3.  There are laws saying Beer labels can't lie to you.
2.  You can prove you have a Beer.
1.  If you've devoted your life to Beer, there are groups to help you
    stop.

H4r H4r, beer is so much fun, especially when you're at a party with 
your boss, and you tell him how cheesy his hairweave looks, then he 
fires you, but then I go to his house and fucking....Yeah umm religion 
is cool. So like the next thing I'm going to talk about is The Bible. 
The Bible rules because well just read some of the stuff Jesus had to 
say:


                          - BIBLE MISINTERPRETATIONS -

The Bible says it's alright to be a bitch:
     Mary rode Joseph's ass all the way to Jerusalem.

Jesus drove a Honda:
     All the disciples were in one Accord.

The first mention in the Bible of Drugs
  The adultress getting stoned...

of Elasticity
  Jesus tying his ass to a tree and then walking 40 miles into the 
desert

of Soccer
  Jesus going up for the cross

of Motorcycles
  The roar of David's Triumph was heard through out the land.

of Sex
  Jesus going to Mount Olive....then getting laid in the tomb

I like reading The Bible, especially when you go to a Bible study, and 
the chaperone is a 20 year old chick who is so hot that you pop a huge 
boner, and you go into the back room and slowly start...Yeah some 
churches are like fucked up, and their messages on their message 
boards get a bit out of control...

                                
Who said religion is not fun?  

Here are actual messages from real church bulletins.  The names of the 
churches are not given to protect the guilty.

1.  This afternoon there will be a meeting in the south and north ends
    of the church.  Children will be baptized at both ends.
2.  Tuesday evening there will be an ice cream social.
    All ladies giving milk, please come early.
3.  Wednesday, the ladies liturgy society will meet.  Mrs.  Johnson
    will sing:  "Put me in my little bed," accompanied by the Pastor.
4.  Thursday at 5pm there will be a meeting of the little mothers
    club. All those wishing to be come little mothers, please meet the
    minister in his study.
5.  This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Johnson to come forward
    and lay an egg on the altar.
6.  The services will close with "little drops of water." One of the
    ladies will start quietly and the rest of the congregation will
    join in.
7.  On sunday, a special collection will be taken to defray the
    expenses of the new carpet.  All those wishing to do something on
    the carpet, come forward and get a piece of paper. 
8.  The ladies of the church have cast off clothing of every kind and
    they may be seen in the church basement on friday afternoon.
9.  A bean supper will be held saturday evening in the church
    basement. Music will follow.
10. The rosebud on the altar this morning is to announce the birth of
    David Alan Belser, the sin of Reverend and Mrs. Julius Belser.

Oh man I love those message boards, one time I left a message on a 
public dating board, and I said I was a hot lesbian chick with big 
boobies, and then like these 5 chicks all messaged me back and then 
they came over for like a big group...OK there are many different 
types of Religions, below is a chart stating all of there beliefs.


Religions Of The World          
        
Taoism:                               Shit happens.

Discordia:                            Why did you want this shit to happen?

Well that's it for the religion jazz, I'm like going to do some other 
stuff now and like there might be a Bible study tonight, (read above), 
Yeah so as I leave you I slowly unzip my pants and pull out my...So 
see you kids later, and remember religion is fun.

Do you like blowing shit up? I mean really blowing shit up? then read 
on.....

ok now I will explain how to build an atomic bomb.....oh yea I take no 
responsibility for the shit you do.. ya da ya da ya da.

MATERIALS:

   - 20 KG WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM
   - TNT OR C4
   - WIRE
   - BLASTING CAPS 
   - A TIMING DEVICE OR RADIO CONTROLLED DETONATOR
   

HOW TO GET THE MATERIALS:

PLUTONIUM- You can get this out west in the united states...its 
usually underground but its in its natural state so unless you know 
how to covert it (cause I sure don't) your assed out

C4- Well unless you got connections once again your assed out cause I 
don't fell like explaining how to make c4..

WIRE- Look around your damn house

BLASTING CAPS- I don't know where the hell to get them

DETONATOR- you can make one from a car battery and an alarm clock


ok now that I accurately explained how to make or get the materials 
needed on to the construction....

CONSTRUCTION:

QUICK NOTE: Since you will be working with Plutonium I suggest you 
wear a T-shirt and some shorts because they will serve as no 
protection what so ever against the Radioactive material. One 
microscopic bit of the Plutonium will kill the fuck out of you!#@!

CONSTRUCTION:

STEP 1:

Take the Plutonium and place it on something that will allow you to 
get it from all angles. Next, take small sized chunks of the c4,about 
the size of a golf ball, and press them on the ball of plutonium in an 
even pattern all around. place a blasting cap in each charge.

STEP 2:

run the wires from the charges to the detonator making sure that the 
charges stay in place.
set the detonator up so that when the clock reads a certain time it 
will go off.

NOTE: if you are using a radio controlled detonator make sure you use 
a quiet radio frequency    because the bomb might go off in the middle 
of configuration. that would be kinda funny wouldn't it?

STEP 3:

take the bomb to where you want to set it off and get the fuck out of 
there dumbass! you probably want to be at least 3 or 4 miles away when 
it goes off...unless its a suicide attempt...that would be a cool way 
to go

HOW IT WORKS:

The explosion of the c4 charges causes the plutonium to implode and  
achieve critical mass and explode with an uncontrolled chain 
reaction.... atleast I think thats what happens..... you people act 
like I know what the hell I'm doing

PS: If you are really thinking of making this and setting it off 
somewhere...cool! Go ahead!! I damn well encourage it 110% !@#$!!

 ____________________________________________________________________










B0g:   your webpage is located at http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp , what
       is the purpose of that site?

Rfp:   To provide something other than porn on the internet.  Although 
       I've been succumbing to doing that as well.


B0g:   you are regarded as one of the major influences (in my opinion
       anyway) in the whole hacking community, do you consider
       yourself as a hacker or merely a software enthusiast, and
       where do you draw the line?

Rfp:   I am a hacker in the traditional sense--I seek to learn how
       things work. I am not a computer criminal, and screw anyone who
       is determined to use other invented terms, such as 'cracker'
       and what not.  They are computer criminals, people.  
       Simple terminology, rather than trying to invent a
       cracker/jacker/whacker term.

B0g:   Were you ever a scriptkiddie? Have you ever defaced a site?

Rfp:   Have I ever ran scripts?  Sure.  But do I understand exactly
       what they do?
       Well, most the time. ;)
       Have I ever defaced a site? 
       I don't find that productive in the least bit.

B0g:   Some rumors says you are/were one of the core members in HFG,
       is this just bull?

Rfp:   Wow, that's a new one on me.  HFG?  Nope, sorry.

B0g:   What do you personally think about scriptkiddies?

Rfp:   You know, you have to learn somewhere.  But taking a script and
       Breaking into ### sites because you can only proves you to be a
       newbie that is acting out some childhood angst in a digitial
       realm.
       Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

B0g:   Is there such a thing as a legit hack?

Rfp:   Sure.  Security assessments and penetration testing, otherwise
       known as contracted security evaluation.  Why hack and go to
       jail, when you can hack and get paid for it?

B0g:   For the complete newbie, what is in your opinion the best way
       to get on the information highway?

Rfp:   Don't think that there is a shortcut.  You have to wait in
       rushhour just like everyone else.  Hit the books, start
       learning, and don't let your eagerness get ahead of you.

B0g:   What are your top 5 bookmarks?

Rfp:   Oooh, good one.  On a daily basis, I visit ww.technotronic.com,
       www.securityfocus.com, packetstorm.securify.com, and
       archives.neohapsis.com.  Plus I visit my site from time to time
       to see if it's been defaced. ;)

B0g:   Your site, while providing excellent security information,
       exploits, fixes and software, it doesnt offer much about
       RFP-the person, how would you best summon up yourself as a
       person? What are your best/worst qualities?

Rfp:   I'm just a puppy, trying to learn what I can, and contribute
       where I may to the community in general.  I'm not to claim to
       know much of anything...just a few interesting tidbits here and
       there.  I like to think I'm pretty easy going, and like to do
       all of this because it's "fun".

B0g:   Are you self-employed? Do you make a living out of doing
       security related work? If so, give us figures! H0h0!

Rfp:   Yes, I make a comfortable living doing security work for a
       company in Chicago.

B0g:   Do you see Microsofts Monopoly coming to an end?

Rfp:   If I could look into the future, I would rather look for
       lottery numbers than the final outcome of Microsoft. ;)

B0g:   As the saying goes; an OS is only as Secure as its Admin, in
       your opinion, what is the most secure OS?

Rfp:   People need to get over the religious bias and realize all
       OSes, and software in general, are tools.  You use the right
       tool for the right job.
       That said, any OS can be made secure--just some take more work
       than others.  If I had to pick, I would probably say most the
       BSD distros, and a few Linux distros, have their act together.
       But I don't see corporations running out to purchase BSDi
       licenses in bulk just yet...

B0g:   Do you see any big changes in the computer world in the near
       future?

Rfp:   We will get more dependant, stuff will get more complex, and
       more problems will arise.

B0g:   Will you ever write an humorous or technical article for b0g?

Rfp:   Sure!  It's just a matter of finding the time...
       remember, I do all of this in my free time, and I like to,
       well, have a life as well.  You know, life *away* from the
       computer. ;)

B0g:   Does creating public software that scans and searches for
       easily exploitable servers make you feel bad at all?

Rfp:   The software is a tool.  Does holding a knife make you feel
       like a murderer?  It depends on the use, not the tool itself.
       Evil is in the people, not the object.  That said, no. :)

B0g:   Its no secret that the majority of the web defacements are done
       by scriptkiddies, shouldnt the creators of the tools that make
       these hacks possible feel at all responsible for theyre
       wrongdoings? How many hacks would you reckon has been
       accomplished after a successful scan with whisker?

Rfp:   Well, given that whisker only alerts of problems, and doesn't
       show you how to exploit them, I would say none. ;)  In general,
       if people want to find the stuff, they will.  As for whisker,
       hell, Packetstorm gets new CGI scanner submissions every week.
       There are others besides whisker.  
       People need to differentiate their fear between the tools and
       the people that run the tools.

B0g:   Not only does rumors say you were in HFG, some also assume you
       were also involved with The United Loan Gunmen, have you ever
       been apart of any Online groups at all?

Rfp:   Well, myself and the rest of my litter were a part of the
       'Puppies looking for Bitches' group, but we didn't do anything
       constructive.  Mostly chased sticks, barked about this or that,
       etc. ;)

B0g:   What changes do you want to see happening within the online
       world?

Rfp:   People stop being naive to how things work, technically,
       politically, and sociologically speaking.

B0g:   Do you have any special projects for the future? 

Rfp:   Whisker 2.0, along with some sister programs, are my focus.
       Plus an online project that ties whisker, nessus, and snort
       together.

B0g:   In your opinion, who controls the internet? Who should control
       it?
       How do you feel about the bills being set out by politicians
       who have minimal, if any technical insight at all?

Rfp:   Wow, tough question.  Who controls it?  The people who
       understand how it works.  Who should?  No one.  Politicians?
       Plain and simple: there's money to be had, and freedom to be
       denied for the better good of someone, even if it's just
       themselves.

B0g:   Will you link to b0g.org on your page if we send you an
       upside-down button?

Rfp:   Considering it looks cool, absolutely.  
       Sorry, no lame buttons. ;)

B0g:   your site http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp lets the viewer choose
       from 4 different layouts, in number three allure, who is that
       chick?!?!

Rfp:   I wish I knew. >:)  It's just a graphic from a porn site.  
       In fact, I think it's from xp0's (www.antioffline.com) personal
       stash.  I've had enough requests, where I think I will post the
       original sometime in the future.

B0g:   Is there anything you would like to say to the people who read
       this interview that we forgot to ask you about?

Rfp:   Fear potted meat food products.

B0g:   How do I hack unix?

Rfp:   Don't you know?  Unix is the most secure OS on the planet. 
       You can't hack it. 
       Silly newbie. ;)

B0g:   Where can I get codez?

Rfp:   Trading for them at 2600 meetings. ;)

B0g:   ITS BEEN A PLEASURE -THANX VERY MUCH

What the nice possibility is: I forget.
What the evil possibility is: Register all those 30-day trial programs 
you have.

1. PREFACE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Hi,
After being quite silent, finally something from us again. We had a 
couple of problems but are over that now, hopefully we can start 
creating something again.
This file was written after I discovered the formula of the credit 
card number system. It happened by accident, I just filled in a 
MasterCard number and worked it back to it's beginning, then I worked 
up again. I verified all credit card numbers I generated so far with 
Aritech's Verification Engine. I and others also tested random credit 
card numbers on sites. We usually got them to work one way or another. 
Just not www.cheathouse.com yet. :) They use ibill.com's verification 
method and we couldn't figure out a way past that. Verisign's 
verification method isn't fooled either.
So, if you want a product you'll have to go out and find a site that 
is vulnerable. (E-mail me when you find one. :)
Good luck.


2. HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CREDIT CARD NUMBERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You need to start with a credit card number to get new ones.
I suggest you snatch your moms and work from that, because a lot of 
people will use the credit card numbers mentioned here.
For my example, I'll use 5221111111111115
It's a MasterCard and it expires on 02/02. For the formula it doesn't 
matter when your card expires.
MasterCard cards begin with a 5. Visa's with a 4.
Reading this will seem very complicated so open this text for a 2nd 
time and scroll to Appendix A to follow what happens.

You take 5221111111111115.
The system has as a standard that it adds 8 to the number for the next 
valid card.
5221111111111115 + 8 makes 
5221111111111123
you keep adding +8 unless for the following exceptions.

You can't have two numbers that have the same 15 last digits so
5221111111111131 and 5221111111111139 is impossible.
5221111111111131 is valid. To get the next valid card number you add 
18. So you jump from
5221111111111131 to 5221111111111149

Normally, you'd just continue to add 8, but if your 2nd and/or 4th 
and/or 6th and/or 8th, etc, digit from right is a "5" your step 
changes from 8 to 7.
so from 5221111111111149 you jump to 5221111111111156
Again you add 8, as usual.
5221111111111164 +8
5221111111111172 +8
5221111111111180 +8
5221111111111198 +18 because 80 exists, so 88 ISN'T allowed

sometimes it will happen that you need to add 18, but then you land in 
a 5x area, then instead of adding 18, you add 17.
like so:
5221111111111842 +17
5221111111111859 +8 (things go back to normal)
5221111111111867

When you change thousands, your step becomes 6, (8 - 2), when you'd 
normally do a step 18, and you'd then come into a new thousand, you 
add 16 (18 - 2).
Example of a +16 step:
5221111111111990 +16
5221111111112006 +8 (things go back to normal)
5221111111112014 

Example of a +6 step:
5221111111112998 +6
5221111111113004 +8 (things go back to normal)
5221111111113012

When you change ten thousands, your step stays 6, however changing 
hundred thousands your step becomes a mere 4 (8 - 4). So when you'd 
normally step 18 because 4 is to little to change the 15th digit, you 
have to step 14. (18 - 4)
5221111111199995 +14
5221111111200009 +8 (things go back to normal)
5221111111200017

When you change millions, your step stays 4, however changing tens of 
millions your step becomes a extremely small 2 (8 - 6) so when you'd 
normally step 18 you now step 12 to give you the following result.
Example of a +12 step:
5221111111999998 +12
5221111112000010 +18 (things go back to normal, coz 10 and 18 is 
impossible)
5221111112000028

You already know that when you change into a 5x, you need to subtract 
1 (8 - 1), now this is also true for 5xxx, 5xxxxx, 5xxxxxxxxx, etc. 
(thousands, hundreds of thousands, tens of millions)
however, if you change 5x4x to 5x5x or any other combination, you only 
need to subtract 1, so the amount of fives in a code does not matter. 
the step stays 7 (8 - 1).

I haven't run into any other exceptions, but let me know if you do.
Go to Appendix B for a list of credit card beginnings and their 
respective banks.


3. HOW TO USE YOUR OWN CREDIT CARD NUMBERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        3.1 HOW INFO IS VERIFIED AND HOW TO BYPASS THE VERIFICATION
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        All credit card verification schemes are different and check for 
different things, so it's our goal to be as complete as possible and 
if it doesn't work we'll just have to move on.

First the most common problem: They ask for name on card. This is 
where you should worry, you see, if they ask you that, they'll usually 
verify your complete credit card info. (number, name on card, expiry). 
Just make up a realistic sounding name (John Smith is NOT realistic, 
nor is Pocahontas, Willy or "Fuck you") and try it.

Expiry date sounds worse than it actually is. It only gets checked if 
the name on card, etc. is too, you see, the expiry date isn't tied to 
the credit card number so you can think up anything (within reason). I 
suggest you make the expiry date somewhere 2/3 years from now.

Especially for registering software, they ask for a E-mail address. 
This has to be yours. Make an anonymous one somewhere.

They'll ask you for an address and sometimes even a phone number, find 
one on www.infospace.com. Just type a common last name, you'll have a 
full address with real zip code, etc. in no time. 

Just try to be as truthful as possible to make everything seem natural 
so they don't call the phone number you supplied to verify everything.


        3.2 HOW TO SECURE YOURSELF
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't order anything from or to your house. Don't order from 
your house because your IP will be logged, etc. If you feel you must 
order from your house, at least use a proxy and try to not use your 
own dial-up account.
The best thing to do is to order or register something from a 
cybercafe or school, or just about any other public place that can't 
be only tied to you.

Don't order anything to your house, this is an extreme always counting 
no no. If they have the address where the goods got sent to, or your 
address when you registered something, they know who to arrest, 
because only you would profit from such a thing. (Nice idea if you 
want to get someone into trouble).
Rent a house somewhere, stand in front of one, whatever, be original, 
just as long as you DON'T send it to your house.

Only make a new free E-mail account and login once to retrieve your 
key. After that, NEVER login to that account again.

Keep on using different addresses and last names. This is important, 
because otherwise if you get caught you can be traced to multiple 
credit card fraud crimes instead of one.

Also, don't keep on trying different credit card numbers and/or other 
info, your tries get logged and are kept. Taking 5 tries to be able to 
get something and having different addresses all 5 times is REALLY 
suspicious and they'll check it out.

No matter what anyone ever told you, it is a crime to "card" and if 
you're dumb about it and send it to your own home or if you register 
something without a safe proxy and your own internet account, you will 
get screwed.


4. LAST NOTES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's not my fault if you get caught, and let me repeat: THIS DOES NOT 
ALWAYS WORK. This just increases your chances. 
I would like to thank the following people: Dark Plague for supplying 
me with the bank codes, Hyrax for the ¯ character idea, and the 
following testers: Artech, Spiderfire, Candyman.
To all the people I didn't mention yet did help me: Thank you very 
much.
And a note to Chronoss: you have no life, I work my butt of and what 
comes from me is bad, but at least I try, I stay polite and I actually 
have a real life. None of these things can be said of you. Why do you 
threaten me? You snitched to the cops not me. So what if I don't like 
it?

Have fun!

Greetz,
nemesystm

APPENDIX B

These are existing banks and their respective credit card number 
begin.
These beginning digits are numbers according to CreditMaster 4.0. I 
just made a selection. Like I said, I suggest you take your moms 
credit card and just use the formula on that. If you wish to use a 
bank that has a country name behind it, get a address in that country 
to look credible. Also, try to make the address in the same state as 
the name of the bank seems to be from. Like "Alaska USA Fed C.U." 
would mean: find an address in Alaska.

to check your own. 
If you extrapolated a XXX000000000000x to a XXX999999999999x group or 
a XXXXX0000000000x to a XXXXX0000000000x, there is an easy check: the 
last digit of the last credit card number should be the same as the 
last digit of the first credit card number.
If you extrapolated a XXXX00000000000x to a XXXX99999999999x group, 
the check is that the last digit of the last credit card numbers is 
one more than the last digit of the first credit card number.
If you extrapolated a XXXXXX000000000x to a XXXXXX999999999x group, 
there is also a check: the last digit of the last credit card number 
should be 1 less than the last digit of the first card.

Hello, my name is pac. 
I am here to express my views on ICQ (the real name is I seek Jews)
I will express my theorys on how I seek jews got its name, the 
history of I seek jews and some neet tricks to do on I seek jews.  
Here we Go

Problem #1
How Did I Seek Jews Get its name?

Theory #1
I seek jews got its name because in 1989 allot of jews migrated to the 
united states and they wanted to keep in touch.  Historians seriously 
support this theory, but I dont think its correct

Theory #2
I seek Jews was made by a man who loved to assfuck young jews and old 
jews so he created this and told all the jews to get it then after it 
spread he asked for peoples address and went to their houses and 
assfucked them. Historians doubt this but after asking a reliable 
Jewish source that 'lives' in an insane asylum, he told me that this 
is true.  I actually think this is the real story.  

Theory #3
I seek jews was created by Adolph Hitler in 1938 when he first started 
killing jews. it began as an all Jewish talk system and Hitler would 
ask them if they knew where a jew was hiding or if they were in 
hiding, either way this wouldnt of worked because computers werent 
around then.

Theory #4
Well, I seek jews was created by Hitler's descendants to try to finish 
his job, I dont think this is it either but another reliable source 
who is Hitler's fathers brothers daughters fathers sons daughters 
uncles brothers girlfriends dogs mothers fathers cats uncles sons 
nephew told me it was the real truth.  Historians doubt this theory.

Problem #2
What is the History of I Seek Jews.  

actually I pretty much explained the early history of I seek jews and 
apparently it only spread into a much bigger chat system.  

Problem #3 
"I'm Lame and I dont know any leet hax0r tricks on ICQ"

Leet hax0r trick #1
when someone messages you, dont receive the message yet, go to msdos 
and type netstat -n and JEW CAN GET THEIR EYE PEE.  but what are YOU 
going to do with it?

Leet hax0r trick #2
If you really wanna piss people off in I SeEk JeWz Chat, call them 
dirty sand niggers, then press CTRL+G and CTRL+L over and over again, 
its really leet.  

Leet hax0r trick #3 
Send out chain letters that say "This is not a chain letter, however 
if you delete it and dont send it to everyone on your list then your 
going to have your penis cut off and stuck in your nose
and youll have to live with it like that for the rest of your 
life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
Then say "this message has been going on since 1492 when Columbus 
first got to the US please keep it going!"

Leet hax0r trick #4
Go around yelling to people your I seek jews number and tell them you 
dont hide your IP so they ph33r you.

Besides all that, icq sucks 

This was an article I put together in less then an hour I hope 
everyone enjoyed it...
I'd Like to thank obsolete he helped me think of some of the things to 
put in here and hes really leet!@$#$#@%$!#@$$#$#

there once was a k-rad dood,
who was so smelly it was crude.

his mom called his a whore, 
and his dad analy raped Al Gore.

His sister was a skank
I fucked her in a fish tank

his brother and I were down
we got high and ran around town

we raped all the fat bitches
and threw their dead bodies in ditches

once we went to a movie
there was this woman and she was groovy

I laid the pimp groove down
and she was wearing no frown

the bitch got on her knees
cried and said please!!

I was like bitch you are wack
just dont chomp on my nut sack!

she was like yes SIR I love you
I was like the names tak you fuckin jew

as she sucks I was like get out from underneath
and dont come back till you brush your teeth

bitches are skanks and skanks are whores
dont be polite make the bitch open doors

with all this said I feel ninja-like
now lets be marry and fly a kite...stupid fuck

Brought to you by the letters E and K, and by my good friend Mary 
Juana. Now to the article.


Well, since Im extremely bored, and dont have the effort, Ill just 
do a stupid article. "Pissing off Radio Shack and other countless 
people." Yes folks, Im in a great mood. Went to sleep at a nice 3:30 
am, got up at a nice 7:30 am, yessiree life is great. Why was I up so 
late? I was confing! Yes, it is so unbelievably elite and #k-rad that 
I just cant get enough. What do you do on a conf? You do one of three 
things. If you are a newbie, or just stupid, you lurk, or dont talk 
at all. If you are bored, and a regular, you barely talk, and mostly 
play annoying music. If youre a veteran you have 3-way calling on 
your phone so you prank. So who do we call? Anyone. Dont worry, this 
is just the introductory paragraph.

So, you want to become a l33t-0 prankster or veteran. You must know a 
few things, and one of them is beige boxing. If you are not a loser 
you can beige box, and I only say this because there are billions of 
losers out there. 3000 text articles have been written on this, and 
you ONLY NEED FOUR SENTENCES. 1) Get a phone, take the cord and cut 
it, and slice off the plastic, so all you have is the red and green 
wires, you dont need the yellow or black wires. 2) Go outside to a 
neighbors house and get a comfortable seat next to their telco box. 3) 
Open box, (may need a wrench to get the bolt off) attach red and green 
wires to the screws you see, and call a conf number, and set it up. 4) 
When you have enough people call the host number, and party. Simple as 
that.

Now you are a regular, you can setup a conf etc. Go to radio shack, 
and ask for either item 44-533BB or 43-1237. 533B is 3$, 1237 is about 
14$. Either one is ok. Now, at your computer, do start-run and type in 
sndrec32, or if you have some other audio program use it. Set the mics 
up (whichever) and read the next part.

If you do not have 3-way you are stupid, and should get it, its great. 
Pick a number that you think you could do something with, such as an 
Indian Restaurant where they dont understand english (sorry, but they 
dont, and Im not racist). Turn on your mic/program and hit either 
flash-number-flash or hangup-number-hangup and everyone on the conf 
will hear it. Have one designated person do the talking, and fuck with 
em. Heres a sample conversation:

[me]: Excuse me, can I have a pound of elephant testicles?
(Waiter): Sorry?
[me]: A pound of elephant testicles?
(Waiter): Please hold
[me]: No..
-hold music-
[me]: Fucker.
(Manager): Yes, you want one smuggled elephant tusk?
[me]: Uhh.. no, TESTICLE
(Manager): All out!

And heres NOT HOW TO DO IT AT ALL, NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THE 
FOLLOWING CONVERSATION

[Stupidperson]: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAA
(Waiter): Yes?
[Stupidperson]: Uhh.. yea, can I have.. HAHAHAHAHAHAHH
-hung up-
[Stupidperson]: HAHAHHAHAHHAAH

Ok. Now you know the basics, now you need your Plist. Yes, its a 
stupid name for a prank list, but fuck you. Take down the names and 
numbers of a bunch of stores, and think of funny things you could do, 
such as call up a giant store (Dominicks) and say that youre locked 
in the bathroom and you dont know where in the warehouse you are. 
Theyll go nuts trying to figure out what happens. Or, call up Best 
Buy and say you are "Bob from Sales" and ask to be put on the intercom 
because your number isnt working. Then play loud annoying music much 
to the dismay of the customers. Personal numbers are MUCH more fun but 
can get aggressive, so I suggest you be careful. Fun ideas are saying 
you are towing their car, arresting their wife, arresting their 
daughter for first degree murder and DUI. Go nuts. Now, get a wav->mp3 
encoder, stick it on mp3.com, and rake in the rewards (not much).

Since this was a stupid article and you probably know this, Ill give 
you a small tidbit of interesting information. I was on a conf with 
Burrows and he told me a cool thing. He (along with everyone I know) 
is a mathematician (close to one..) and loves number theory etc. He 
said if you take the mean point for the start of a river (point A) and 
the mean point for the end of a river (point B, going into the ocean) 
and take the distance from A to B ALONG THE RIVER, youll have 
distance X. Now take the distance in a straight line from A to B to 
get distance Y. If you take the ratio of X to Y (X/Y) you get about 
pi, every time. Cool.

Disclaimer:  All of the included information is this text is for 
educational purposes only.  You agree that you are a Licensed Cellular 
Phone Salesperson.  You agree also that you will not use this text to 
accomplish anything illegal or against the company 
Nokia(tm). 
Again this text is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and I, the 
writer, will not take responsibility for your actions.




        In this text I will cover pretty much all the methods you need 
to know to be able to program and use all of the functions that are 
included in a Nokia Cellphone.

I. Programming Menu
II. NAM1 and NAM2
III. Phone Features
IV. Programming
V. Tips & Tricks
VI. FAQ
VII. Shouts


I.      The programming menu is the menu used by the seller of the phone 
      and it is used to hook the phone up with a service.  The default 
      programming code is *3001#12345#.  If this doesn't work it's     
      because the seller has changed the 12345 to something else.  
      The other possible number is the Security Code.  
      If  neither of the numbers work or you don't know your security   
      code don't worry, there are other ways to get into the phone.  
      The features are NAM1, NAM2, Security, Emergency, SW Version, 
      Serial Number, Programmed Date, and Field Test.  


II. NAM1 and NAM2 are your service 
numbers.  They are what is used to tell 
your service that it is your phone 
calling and not someone else who has 
stolen a number.  NAM1 is usually where 
your number is stored.  
III. The features of NAM1 and NAM2 are: Home System ID, Home SOC, Own 
Number, Alpha tag, PSID:RSID lists, and Change defaults.  
        
        Home System ID or SID is the identification number your service  
      uses to know that it's your phone calling and not a clone.  
        
        Home SOC is the System Operator Number your service uses to let  
      your phone know what service it's using.  
      Here are some SOC numbers most widely used: 
      US-AWS = 2049, Canada-Rogers Cantel Inc. = 2050, Bell South 
      Cellular = 003, Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems 
      = 004, Vanguard = 007, Century Cellunet = 008, Pacific Telecom 
      Cellular = 009, and Midwest Wireless Communications = 010.   
      These are either US or International so do some research and
      find ones in your area.  If your really bold you can call 
      Nokia(tm) at 1-888-Nokia-2U and ask them for SOC numbers is your
      area.
        
        Own Number is the ten digit area code and phone number of your
      phone (duh!).
        
        Alpha Tag is the name of you SID that is displayed on the phone
      such as BellSouth or Fido.  The alpha tag is overridden only if
      you have a PSID or RSID.

        PSID:RSID Lists are the list of PSID, Private System ID and
      RSID, Residential System ID that your phone uses.  Most likely
      these won't be on your phone unless you have specified a dealer
      to setup a PSID:RSID Service.


Change Defaults brings you to a menu of all the default settings on 
your phones NAMs such as: NAM STATUS, ACCESS METHOD, LOCAL OPTION, 
PRIMARY PAGING CH, SECONDARY PAGING CH, DEDICATED CCH A, DEDICATED CCH 
A NBR, DEDICATED CCH B, DEDICATED CCH B NBR, OVERLOAD CLASS, GROUP ID, 
SID ALPHA TAG CONTROL, and A-KEY.  These will sometimes vary from 
phone to phone but you'll usually find all these.  The defaults aren't 
something to be messed with because if these are changed to invalid 
numbers the phone won't work, so I recommend keeping these the same.


III.    Features on the Programming menu other than NAM1 and NAM2 are 
Security, Emergency, SW Version, Serial Number, Programmed Date, and 
Field Test.  These all have different functions and do different 
things to your phone.  I'm not going to go to much in depth on these 
because there are allot of things you can do using these features.

        Security is your Security Code.  The default is 12345 and in 
this menu you are able to change it to whatever you like but it has to 
be a five digit number.  If you change it, it alters your programming 
code to *3001#_____#, whereas the blank space represents your new 
security code.

        Emergency is the list of emergency numbers you have such as 911, 
*911, etc.  If you change one of these to a different number, let's 
say 555-9999, if you dial 555-9999 and press send it will dial 911 or 
the emergency number in your area.  Contrary to popular belief if you 
enter a number such as the one describe earlier it won't call that 
number for free, it will call the emergency number in your area.

        SW Version is the Version of your phone you have.  This may be 
either 5120a, 5160, etc.  It all depends on your phone.

        Serial Number is pretty much the number that is given to your 
phone when it was made by Nokia(tm).  This is the number of your phone 
and it cannot be modified.

        Programmed Date is the date your phone was programmed.  It is 
used as a reference by the seller for information on when this phone 
was programmed.  It can only be modified once, you cannot change it 
once a date is set.

        Field Test is used to see how 
the phone and the service are working 
together.  It tests the settings one 
your phone with the service and checks 
to see if it is working properly.  If 
enabled, once the phone is turned off 
then back on again, the Field Test 
screen will be in display.  It lets you 
scroll through seven different menus, showing you information about 
the phone.
 To disable Field Test re-enter the programming code and set Field 
Test to Disabled.


IV.     Now for the fun part!  I know must of you probably skipped 
straight to this section without reading the above so I strongly 
suggest reading the above or you might screw up your phone.  I am not 
responsible if you completely screw up your phone or any one else's 
phone for that matter.  Ok, Programming Nokia phones is quite easy.  
In fact they even give you an easy setup method.  All you need to 
hook up your phone with service is a number, the SID and the easy 
programming method code.  The easy method code varies depending on the 
type of A-Key that you'd like to use to program the phone.  To program 
random A-Key NAM1 you would use *#639# or *#6391#. To program a 
default A-Key NAM2 you would use *#6392#.  When either of these keys 
are entered the phone will display Cellular Number.  Enter the 10 
digit number you have and press OK.  Then the phone will display 
System ID Code.  Enter the SID code you have. You have the option to 
add a Lock Code or Language to the phone by supplying it after you 
enter the SID, for example your SID is 175, you'd enter 175#(5 digit 
lock code)#(language number).  The numbers for language are as 
follows: 0 = English, 1 = French, 2 = Spanish, and 3 = Portuguese.  
Now press OK and your phone will turn off then turn back on with the 
number you programmed in the display.  Congratulations, you have 
successfully programmed a Nokia(tm) Phone!  If when it turns back on 
and displays NAM Error, you must re-program your phone again with the 
correct information this time.


V.      Here are some tips and tricks to Nokia(tm) phones.  Use your 
phreaking skills to clone someone elses phone by getting their SID 
and Phone Number.  Change the emergency numbers on someones phone so 
that when they dial a certain number it calls an emergency number.  
Lock your phone from use by anyone else with the Security Code.  
Always keep everything free, and don't charge people for your 
knowledge 
otherwise you'll be on my shitlist!


VI.     Here are some FAQs:
Q: Can you setup a phone for me?
A: Nope, thats why I made this text.

Q: Will these codes work on all Nokia
(tm) models?
A: These codes work with the 2110 and 
up.

Q: Are some of these things illegal?
A: Most Defiantly!

Q: Is it easy to trace cell phones?
A: Surprisingly it isn't, unless you 
hook up a phone with 2 different 
services.  They will catch you then.

Ok everyone here is my article, it's a simple rap for the members of 
b0g!@#!. ph33r!!@#!@#

(To the tune of "The Real Slim Shady" by Eminem, The Marshall Mathers 
LP, 
Track 08.)

ya'll act like you never seen a mad hax0r before,
jaws all on the floor,
like J.P. and Mitnick burst through the door,
and started packeting each other worse than before,
they first packeted a whore.
It's the return of the...
"Oh wait, no way, you're kidding, he didn't just say bee zero gee did 
he?"
And Dr. Prae said,
Nothing you idiots Dr. Prae's 0wned, he's still runnin 3.1 in his run 
down home.
(Ha Ha)
Little script kiddies love bee zero gee,
chicka chicka chicka k-rad-bob, i'm sick of him, look at him, walkin 
around packeting everyone, flippin the you know who, yeah but he's so 
cute though.
Yeah we probably got a couple of screws up in our head loose,
but no worse then what Prae does to his dog in his parents bedroom.
Sometimes we just wanna get on our comps and let loose but can't,
but it's cool for J.P. to hump a dead moose.
My dick is on your lips,
My dick is on your lips,
And if I'm lucky wh0rde might give it a little kiss.
And that's the message he's sending to little kids,
and we expect em not to know what a linux O/S is.
Of course there going to know what Debian is,
by the time they hit fourth grade,
they got the internet don't they.
We ain't nothin but hax0rs, we'll some of us script kiddies,
who packet other people like cantelope.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes,
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope,
But if you feel like we feel,
We got the antedote,
Women eat your pantyhose,
Sing the chorus and it goes...

(Chorus)
I'm a b0g member,
Yes I'm a b0g member,
All you little script kiddies are just imitating,
So wont the real b0g members please stand up,
Please stand up.

J.P. don't have to hack people to make friends,
Well we do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think we give a damn about getting raided?
Half of you agents can't even stomach us,
Let alone stand us.
"Well b0g what if they did, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why so J.P. can lie just to get us here,
So you can sit me here next to Billy Gates to try to get me to ph33r?
Shit, Dr. Prae better switch me chairs,
So I can set next to l0pth and Defcon,
And here them argue over who they rooted first.
I'm sick of you little script kiddies don't give us the credit we 
need,
"Yeah they're cute but I think they are gay hee hee."
I should download an exploit from packetstorm.securify.com,
And show the whole world how we can own you in a second,
I'm sick of you little script kiddies all you do is annoy me,
So we have been sent here to destroy you,
There's a million of us just like us,
Who cuss like us,
Who are elite like us,
Who dress like us,
Walk, talk, and chat like us,
They just might be the next best thing,
But not quite us.

(Chorus)

We're like a headtrip to listen to,
Cause we're only bringing you things,
You joke about with your friends inside the chat rooms,
The only difference is we got the balls to say,
In front of J.P. and ya'll,
And we don't got to be false or sugar coated at all,
We just get on the comp and spit it,
And wether you like to admit, (err it)
We just hacked you faster than 90% of you hackers out there,
Then you wonder how can kids eat up our zines like valiums,
It's funny cause at the rate he's going,
Bob will be the only person in the nursing home flirty,
Pinchining nurses asses when he's jackin' off with Prae,
And he's jerkin,
But his whole box of pr0n isn't working,
And every single person is a b0g member lurkin',
He could be working at Anti-online,
Sucking J.P.'s dick,
Or in the HNN writing,
Screamin he don't give a fuck,
With his system open and his speaker up,
So will the real b0g members please stand up,
And put one of your boxes on standby for a sec,
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control,
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

(Chorus)


Well, that's it. Some lines were the same, some lines I mixed it up, 
but 
all in all it was pretty damn funny. Shoutz to Prae (leave your dog 
alone), k-rad-bob (thanks for the help), thep0et, pac!@!@#$, z0x0 (I'm 
the real shady not you), everyone in #k-rad, b0g!@#!, vince (yeah 
baby!), 
ryan (my lubba), and everyone else who I forgot.

o, you are into programming, and want to create cool apps for your 
GNOME desktop, so the whole free software movement will benefit? 
Or you just want all your friends to see how leet you are?
Then you came to the right place! This tutorial will teach you how to 
code in GTK+ and GNOME. This is part of a beginners series. For this 
tutorial lets create a simple notepad like application. First, if you 
ever coded for any object oriented system, you know the concept of 
events. GTK+ signals are pretty much the same. Generally the idea is 
simple, you tell a button, "Here's the deal: When the (l)user is 
pressing you, call this function: button_callback_or_something, and 
I'll tell you what to do from there...". OK, lets begin. First we 
begin the program:

int main(int argc, char *argv)
{
        gnome_init(PACKAGE, VERSION, argc, argv);
        make_ui();
        gnome_main();
}

I don't think this requires explanation, but in case it does, here it 
is:
gnome_init - initializes the gnome libraries. 
gnome_main - starts the main GTK+ loop.
make_ui - will follow...

OK - make_ui - for clearity I separated the user interface from the 
main function. Unless your lame, you won't do it in your own apps. 
Once you get the idea of GTK+, don't forget to read the guidelines on 
developer.gnome.org.
Anyway, I'm off the subject. 

void make_ui()
{
        GtkWidget *window, *entry;

        window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
        gtk_widget_ref(window);
        gtk_widget_set_name(GTK_WIDGET(window), "main_window");

        entry = gtk_entry_new();
        gtk_widget_ref(entry);
        gtk_widget_set_name(GTK_WIDGET(entry), "text");
        gtk_container_add(GTK_WIDGET(entry), GTK_CONTAINER(window));

        gtk_widget_show_all(window);
}

If you will try to run this app, you will notice, that the progie does 
exit when you close the window. To make the app do that, you need to 
connect the "delete_event" signal from the window, to gtk_main_quit().
Anyway, we'll deal with it later. 

OK, the gtk_(something)_new, is, (duh), creating a new widget. It
returns a pointer to the widget. gtk_window_new receives a argument
- window type. It can be GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL, GTK_WINDOW_DIALOG, or
GTK_WINDOW_POPUP.

gtk_widqet_ref - makes GTK+ notice the widget. It includes the widget 
in the event loop. It makes the widget emit signals.

gtk_widget_set_name - obviously - set the "name" property of the 
widget. Since GTK can't guess how you named your variable, in which 
you contain the pointer to the widget, you must set it.

gtk_container_add - this function adds the widget to the container. In 
this case, the container is the window, and the widget is the entry.

K, now that we understand what it means, let's connect the signal.

gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(window), "delete_event", 
(GtkSignalFunc)ExitApp, NULL);

void ExitApp(gpointer data)
{
        gtk_main_quit();
}

So, what do we got here?
gtk_signal_connect - is used to tell GTK to call the function ExitApp 
when "delete_event" is emitted. This should be called somewhere after 
gtk_window_new().

gtk_main_quit() is exiting the event loop.

Now, you see this NULL in there, its the parameter to the callback 
function. You can pass anything in there. In this case we don't need 
anything, so we pass NULL.

Anyway, once the window is closed, the program exits. 

K, see ya next month, when k-rad-bob will get the next b0G out. The 
subject of my next article, will be packing boxes, when the ultimate 
goal is creating a gui for a DoS attack. Sorry for the lack of l33t 
sp34k, but this article was written on a palm, and the palm is not the 
best place to write l33t sp34k. Anyway, I didn't decide what DoS I 
will use, so I'm open to suggestions. Tell k-rad-bob your DoS of 
choice.

PS. Compiling this thing: gcc `gnome-config --cflags` -o shit -O2
shit.c `gnome-config --libs`

Making Cocaine@#!


   Materials:

Oven(1)
Cookie Sheet(1)
Knife or Razorblade (1)
Bottle of nasal spray(1)...you know, that stuff that you spray up your 
nose when you are sick
Cloth Rag (2)

   Procedure:

1. Turn the oven on, 500 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. Wipe off the cookie sheet as to make sure there is no powder or
   residue on it.

3. Open the bottle of nasal spray, if you can, take the cap off.

4. Pour\Spray the liquid inside of the nasal spray container onto the
   cookie sheet(ALL OF IT).

5. Place the cookie sheet into the oven, and leave it there until the
   liquid has evaporated.

6. Use the rags to cover your hands so when you pull out the cookie
   sheet you dont burn yourself.

7. Place the cookie sheet on a flat surface.

8. Get the knife or the Razorblade and scrape the powder type
   substance off of the cookie sheet.

9. Place the powder in a bowl or some type of container, try some if
   you like.

0. Sell, because yes, it is a cheap version of cocaine.

 ____________________________________________________________________





I've been hanging out in #hacktech one or two nights a week for the 
past two years.  Some of you may recognize my nick(s), though I've 
never had much of a conversation with any of you, except for the odd 
question here and there.  I've spent most of my time in the channel 
lurking, trying to pick up bits of info here and there, and just 
generally learning. I've never really contributed anything since I 
never believed I had anything worth contributing. 
Two years ago I was an avid coder though I knew nothing about computer 
hacking, Unix, computer security or anything related to that. Now, I 
know a lot, with still a lot more to learn.  

During the past two years I respected a lot of the people in #hacktech 
since I generally believed they were true hackers, in the real sense 
of the word.

I was wrong.

I only realized this in the past couple of months when I made a 
significant breakthrough in my learning experience.  Every hacker and 
programmer out there as had them.  I just had one of those days where 
all the bits and pieces of information gleamed the past couple of 
years finally seemed to fit together and everything made much more 
sense. Since then Ive learned plenty more and continue to learn.  I 
don't think the learning process ever stops.  Though I may not be 
inclined to retrieve Bill Gate's credit info and use it to buy 100,000 
iMac's I still would call myself a hacker - in the true sense of the 
word.

What is this "true sense" I'm talking about.  Well, I'm not going to 
go into too much detail here, because there's volumes of textfiles out 
there detailing this, some of them which I agree with, some of them 
which I don't, but many, if not all, carry the same basic premise. I 
think it sums up nicely with this statement.

Hacking is the exploration of intelligence and genius, with the 
maturity to apply it usefully and productively. 

Einstein was a hacker. He hacked quantum physics.

Benjamin Franklin was a hacker.  He hacked electricity.

Bill Clinton is a hacker.  He hacks off. <-- sorry, bad j/k

Back to what I was saying; a computer hacker is somebody who 
experiments with computing systems using their intelligence and 
oftentimes genius to create and discover new methods, new ideas, and 
better ways of doing things, with the hope that they have the maturity 
to use that information usefully and productively. 
It may not be for the good of society (Einstein's work led to the 
atomic bomb), but as long as its put to a use which achieves something 
worthwhile (Atomic bomb helped end World War 2) then its a productive 
use of intelligence. Again it may not be noble, but at least its use 
has a purpose.

Now, you're probably wondering why the hell I've rattled on for 485 
words. 
What has this to do with b0g and #hacktech?

Well, as I mentioned at the start, I don't believe most of the 
regulars in #hacktech (mainly OPS since I don't know many others) are 
hackers, in the "true sense of the word".  They don't put their 
knowledge or skills to any proper use.  One of the reasons I stayed in 
#hacktech so long was that when I learned enough maybe I'd have made 
good friends with some so that we could share information and work on 
projects together.  That hasn't happened since I believe we're on 
completely different planets here, and you people just don't want to 
learn.  

The topics of conversation on #hacktech and in b0g (is this zine 
affiliated with the channel?) revolve around #dogsex (please, don't 
embarrass humanity by encouraging these people), calling people gay, 
constant masturbating and details of your apparent sexual and asexual 
lives. Anybody who disagrees with anybody is accused of being gay, a 
script kiddie or anything else under the sun.  
Discussion of facts and the exchange of information doesn't seem to 
occur to you people. Megabytes of logs lay testament to this.

I've often seen this.  "Let's packet the bastard".  Is this statement 
something a hacker would say or an immature kid in front of a PC. 
Things like this seem to be said and done frequently in #hacktech.

That just irritates every cell in my body.  You call yourselves 
hackers but all you do is DoS, insult blacks, and talk about how many 
times a day you masturbate.

I know for a fact that many of you are still in school so I understand 
this. Lots of kids do that, but let me tell you something from 
somebody who's been through it all.  You're not a hacker.  Chances are 
you never will be.  Trust me.

I mean it.

You just don't have the mentality. I've watched your conversations 
over two years and I've seen little from any of you.  That's just who 
you are. You have to be born a hacker. It's not something you can 
learn.  You don't want to share information, you don't want to learn.  
You just want to hang out on #hacktech and if you come across somebody 
who knows less than you, you try to take advantage of them and 
ridicule them simply to give your own egos a place to 
stand.  Now, whether you do this because you lack any real influence 
or power in your every day lives, I don't know.  But I do know this.  
You're not hackers.  

This doesn't extend to everybody in the channel. I have met a 
memorable few whom I have a great respect for, most of them know way 
more than me, some of them are only beginning, but they are all 
hackers. They know who they are simply by reading this so they needn't 
feel insulted at what I've said above.

What I'm asking for is that you kids out there should mature a little 
faster. Take a hard look at your level of intelligence, and your 
wealth of knowledge and ask yourself are you really putting it all to 
a good and productive use.  If you spend most of your skills causing 
damage, upset, or any kind of nuisance then I suggest you forget about 
hacking and get a job as a systems analyst or something equally 
mundane. You may be the smartest person in the world and know every OS 
and every possible way of circumventing security but if you abuse that 
knowledge then you are *not* a hacker, and should not be one.

For the kids still in school: I have no doubt that some of you know a 
lot and are very intelligent but you lack the maturity and the 
mentality to use that responsibly.  The computer is too powerful a 
tool to be used as a weapon, especially if the use of the weapon is 
simply childish revenge or nastiness. If you can't handle a gun then 
don't use one.  Simple as that.

For the hackers: I respect your skills. You know who you are.

And lastly, (thank god)

This mail will either end up in /dev/null or bandied around the Ops 
while they fight over who they think I'm talking about.  To make it 
easy for you here's my estimation.  Note that since mainly Ops 
populate #hacktech this primarily applies to them, even though there 
are a couple of ordinary regulars who also fit into this.

50% of #hacktech are high school kids (not necessarily a bad thing, 
just that they happen to be the *typical* high school kid, not the 
smart ones)

25% are administrators \ programmers for various companies.  Average 
age 23-28. Probably know plenty about computer security but are only
interested in securing computers not circumventing security.(nothin
wrong with that though).

10% are real hackers.  They generally don't say very much since they 
are generally preoccupied with important stuff and don't give a shit 
about the gay netsex going on in the channel. 

10% are your average curious gimps who usually don't stick around.

5%  are Feds.


If you want to butt fuck each other over the net then do so, but don't 
call yourself hackers.  

If you want to call people stupid for no apparent reason simply that 
they are discussing a concept new to them which you happen to think 
you know about already then do so, but don't call yourself hackers.

If you want to make fun of stupid script kiddies by imitating them and 
writing in their style as a joke then do so, but don't call yourself 
hackers, or comedians for that matter.  

If you want to DoS or "rm -rf /" somebody because it makes you feel 
like you 
have power over them, then do so, but don't call yourself hackers.

If you want to insults blacks, jews, or whatever, then do so, but 
don't call yourself hackers.

Hacking is as much your mentality as your skills.  It's only when you 
achieve the right balance of both when you should feel you've earned 
the title.

First of all, I would like to say that any feedback we get back is 
both helpful and enjoyable to read.  In this case; syn c's article / 
e-mail / complaint / essay - I would just like to give the other side 
of the story.
Everyone knows there are two sides to a story and I would like to 
state mine.

#hacktech has been around since 1995.  Primary as a channel for a 
group of about six friends that were administrators to discuss their 
security.  Keep up with the latest patches / holes and just talk about 
general stuff.

Five years on, #hacktech is living on.  Bigger than ever, packed 
differently at different times.

Our "reason" for existing now is a much bigger group of friends and
administrators, programmers, etc. (an organisation really) to discuss
computer security issues amongst other things.

As syn c stated about us talking about sex, masturbation, etc.  What 
is wrong with that?  People find it easier talking to a complete 
stranger about personal problems as they are not involved.  Doctors 
don't just talk about medical issues - they talk about other totally 
different things.
    Same with #hacktech - you won't find us always talking about 
computer related issues (we are human); but most of the time you will 
 because that's the main 'topic.'  [Thus the channel being named 
"#hacktech" meaning 'Hack Technologies.']

Like syn c - everyone has their own opinions about different things.  
He has his own views (and I respect that); on what a hacker is, 
#hacktech, etc.
That is his opinion; that doesn't mean everyone else agrees.

    Who has the right to define who is a hacker or who is not?
(Sounding like The Matrix now, eh?)
No one does.  So read what you do but DO NOT believe all what you do 
read.  Sum it up and come to your own conclusions.

I would also like to see the evidence of syn c's survey; i.e: "5% are 
feds within #hacktech."  On how many people was this based on?  Is 
this really accurate?  Did you actually see the federal agent's 
warrant card?  Didn't think so. ;)

My argument is not an attempt at getting 'one over on syn c' nor an 
ego trip.  It's just my chance to give my side of the story and stand 
up for my channel and what I / we believe in.

Again; readers, come to your OWN conclusions when you have read and 
summed up all the pieces of evidence.  Thanks for reading.

Welcome to another chapter of Zeddy's Wild Kingdom.  
Today I will be talking about a creature that has vastly multiplied 
and inhabited North America.  I am talking about the creature, 
Niggerous Wannabeous.  Or as he is more commonly known, the North 
American Wigger.  Now the wigger is a rare descendent of the chameleon 
family.  It's most well known trait is the ability to disguise itself 
as a black person.  The wigger does have some flaws in it's disguise.  
It doesn't seem to be able to fool any of the blacks.  Or any whites 
for that matter.  The wigger survives by joining a group of blacks by 
imitating behavior and language.  It is a well known fact that the 
visual acuity of the wigger is far from perfect.  It has color pigment 
problems.  They think everybody, even other white people, are 
black.  This fact is derived by its general greeting call.  "Was Up 
Nigga!"  The wigger also has problems with speech.  They commonly drop 
letters and sounds off of words during everyday speech.  The following 
is an example of this:  "Hey man are you going to the movie?" when 
said by a wigger sounds more like this... "I a stupid little wannabe 
faggot and I think I'm a nigger!".  As you can see the wigger is not 
one of the brightest of the creatures on this planet.  But I decided 
to go and study it anyways.  
Now sit back and the adventure unfolds....

        Welcome I am Zeddy, of Zeddy's Wild Kingdom.  I am here with my 
guide Akanuk.  We are now on the grounds of a high school.  This is 
where Niggerous Wannabeous, the North American Wigger, is most 
commonly found.  We are now observing a group of them from our hiding 
place in the bush.  Though the wigger is fairly harmless on it's own, 
due to its cowardly and timid nature, it is rarely found buy itself.  
It usually stays in large groups surrounded by blacks.  Ah, from our 
vantage point right now, we can see a large group of blacks with a 
wigger among them.  The wigger is easy to distinguish due to his very 
large baggy clothes, and his light skin pigmentation.  He appears to 
be trying to win the affections of a black female.  He yells out his 
mating call, "Sup baby, you fine!".  Hmmmm... 
he appears to have been rejected.  Many environmentalist groups 
predict the wigger to be the next endangered species due to it very 
low ability to attract females.  The wigger does not mate often if 
ever at all.  Oh my, it looks like trouble is starting.  Our wigger's 
"gang" seems to be having a confrontation with another gang of blacks.  
The wigger is yelling insults to the leader of the other gang.  
Fighting breaks out.  The wigger hides behind the large male of the 
gang.  After a few minutes of fighting the other gang flees.  The 
wigger is back out at the front of the pack yelling insults again.  
The wigger is a very cocky creature, but cowardly when confronted.  Oh 
no.  It appears we've been spotted.  A couple of the blacks are 
heading over to us.  Quick, Akanuk, put on your pointy white hood.  We 
stand up.  And scream our cry, "White power!!".  Disguised as KKK 
members, the blacks have fled in terror.  The wigger is now alone in 
front of us.  We approach him for a closer look.  As soon as we get 
near he drops down to the ground and he starts to cry.  He begs us not 
to hurt him.  Seeing as he are not here to hunt, merely observe, we 
throw a few rocks until he gets scared and runs away.  Well Akanuk, we 
have seen all we need, lets take our leave.

        Well I hope this has given all of you a better look into the 
behaviors of the wigger.  Now it is legal to hunt the wigger, the meat 
of it is not worth consuming.  But it is fun to hunt and easy too.  
Well that's all we have time for this week on Zeddy's Wild Kingdom.  
Take care, and remember, it's bad enough being a black, why would you 
want to act like one?

cant walk up the stairs without stopping
people hit you with cars, and total them
people make fun of you cause YOU ARE FAT
my mom calls you fat

you are FAT
you cannot think about anything but food for 30 seconds
if you look like wh0rde's mom

How anyone can crash a Windows or MS-DOS computer by: niemand1

Using the simplest of resources a three year old could crash one, and 
now you can too. Here is how it is done:
Go to DOS or open Notepad in accessories
Open the autoexec.bat file in the C:\ directory
Copy these two lines into the file:


@cd>>x
@%0

Delete all other lines in the autoexec.bat
Save

That's it. There is nothing else you have to do, this will fuck up the 
machine indefinetly. Want to know how it works?

The @ symbol preceeding each command makes it so the command is not 
displayed in DOS. cd>>x will copy the current directory into a file 
called x. %0 repeats this command over and over again and lags the 
computers processes. The file called x will eventually fill the hard 
drive with useless data until nothing else will fit on the hard drive. 

All you will see when you reboot the computer is this:

Starting MS-DOS...

The computer will most likely not respond to any commands after that. 
The way to stop this  program from destroying the computer is booting 
with a system disk or holding the shift key on boot. When your in DOS 
delete the lines from the autoexec.bat file so it won't fuck it up. 
Replace the original commands in the autoexe.bat and save it. Reboot. 

This program is completely malicious, I don't recommend you try it on 
your own computer, it's senseless and insane. I got this idea a long 
time ago from a guy named Scorpion, it has been tried, tested, and 
will work. If I wanted to, I could crash every machine running at my 
school, but that would be pointless. Don't use this for anything dumb, 
it's more powerful than it looks, you have been warned.

I was pressed to make something this month so here it is..

--- CUT HERE ---

#/bin/sh
### secure.sh by Prae - http://www.b0g.org/ ###
#
### USAGE ###
# to run simply type "sh secure.sh" or "chmod 755 
secure.sh;./secure.sh"
#
### DESCRIPTION ###
# Simple script to give a new linux user some BASIC security.
# Don't copy my script without giving me some credit.
# If you dont like it, dont use it! 
# It's not for experts
#
### HELP ###
# if you get an error "ipchains: command not found" try typing
# "cp /sbin/ipchains /usr/bin".
# You WILL need to run this script as root or it wont work.
#
### NOTES ###
# this script requires you have ipchains installed.
# this script DOES remove a few items! if you dont want that
# dont use it!! I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES!
# if you want a customized setup this ISNT the script for you!
# this script will close unnessary ports such as telnet, linuxconf,
# etc. and set up a basic firewall using ipchains.
# Mail me if you have problems or bugs Prae@b0g.org
#
### BEGIN SCRIPT ###
#

For those of you that still hasnt noticed b0g is now officially leet.
Digitalhackers.com did an interview with Cult Hero and non other then

known as Forbidden Knowledge. These guys are obviously Andorrans 
trying to be leet by copying and pasting old phrack articles with new 
headings. 

My leetest article so far would be the official b0g ASCII movie. I 
started making it at work while stressed. Heres the first part:

It was a cold night in my basement, typing away on my Amstrad 1512. 
yea
yea, tis a dinosaur, but im a broke nigga and i live in the ghetto, 
and
this is the best i could get.  you could say i had no life, because i
spent all my time browsing usenet and email dating all this hot chicks 
i
met on irc.
sometimes though some fucking crackhead decides he got to cut some 
wires
just because they look colorful and evil at night.  when that happens 
i do
one thing, i go to my friend the pimp and try scoring some free pussy.
most of the time i dress up, and take these hoochie ass momma's to eat
some spicy KFC.  i like "fried chicken" donchu know, hehe. anyways, 
y'all
know what happens when a guy blows hes load right?  well if you dont 
(you
fucking puritan ass wiping wire cutters) it takes about 15mins to
completely re-charge, and that is if you dont fall asleep like i do, 
30
secs after that blissful moment.  personally i couldnt care less, but 
the
pussy ive been scoring lately have started to smell a lot more than 
usual.
so i go to my friend the pimp and ask him what's up with his "produce"
(hehe produce, he calls them hahah) he tells me, that he doesnt want 
me
around his girls any more.  im like wtf?  he just goes that the girls
here, the lick dick.  simple, they want it hard, like those red-eyed
crackheads fiend for weed.  and you aint supplying it and worse you 
dont
pay for it. im like aight check ima figure something out aight. and i 
walk
away.
by now im starting to jonz for some pussy, i mean fuck that shit,
rumors are spreading around the projects aka Brick City, and not even 
the
retarded skank hoes want to fuck wit me.  aight so i step to my 
basement,
and chill a little, turn on the Amstrad, and boot up GEM Windows (CP/M
owns, but that isnt the point), i open up my hacked version of lynx 
for
CP/M and start looking for something to do about my "personal 
background
problem".  after drooling a little at www.uglypeople.com, i snap out 
of it
and tell myself, " Yes, i CAN!" and i finally
find: http://www.b0g.org/019.shtml.  i read the article, and try it.
fuckin' A, it works.  so i keep working it for about an hour, and i 
must
say, fuck that computer shit, cybersexing, way to hold the power in 
your
left and right hand.
i go back to my friend the pimp, and im like, aight give me your best
girl, ima work her so nice, she'll keep comin' for more...
the rest well you can figure it out, but ill tell you this, even tho 
im a
ghetto broke ass nigga, i still out did that hoocie coohie low riding,
back stabbin, smelly and stank ass hoe.
werd up, b0b. thanks man.

all my fellow b0gsters!

Before I leave v3gtam wants to say something about the article I 
posted in b0g-2.txt :



<crybabymode>
Fuck! I knew it!! I knew that (some) people would totally 
misunderstand my satanist article in b0g #2. I dont blame them at all. 
Soon you`ll know why. I admit that the article was crappy and filled 
with shit. But it all has a reason.
Wyzewun wrote this in forbidden knowledge #11, please let me quote: 

"As for reading the article in b0g on Satanism... well... I have to be 
honest -
I found the entire original content insipid and stupid but the 
passages quoted
directly out of Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible make it worth reading 
anyway,
despite the typos. Especially considering that LaVey was influenced by
Aleister Crowley and HP Lovecraft as were many of the early Khaos 
Magicians
like Austin Osman Spare. And more importantly, regardless of that 
article,
b0g has to be one of the funniest zines the H/P community have 
produced ever."

I must say that I laughed when b0b showed me that article when I met 
him at the mall the day after it was published (we lost a lot of money 
on the slut machines during the next hour. *note*). After reading 
Wyzewuns article, I found out that it was about time I wrote a 
disclaimer. To much shit has come out of that article. I will now take 
the opportunity to defend myself (without being rude to Wyzewun or 
others). It`s in fact b0bs fault. When I first started on the satanist 
article, the idea was that it should be ironical. A joke. That didnt 
come out like it should.  Reason: I wrote a sketch, an outline (or 
whatever) of things that I wanted to have in it, and then fill in 
stuff, ideas along the way,  so people would understand that it was 
ironical, funny even (well, at least me and my ("satanic") friends in 
real life would). I filled in the stuff that I would make fun of (at 
least the clothing style, the tanning thing,  the make up thing etc.).
Dont misunderstand,  I have a large respect for what  LaVey stood for 
and what he represented, and still is. I did not intend to make fun of 
LaVey or the church of Satan or the black magic shit. I just wrote up 
things related to satanism, so I could (as mentioned) come up with 
ideas on the way.
But ok, I was online, writing on the article, talking on irc and such. 
While talking to b0b, I told him that I was writing on my article 
(this was a thursday I think), and he wanted to see what I had done so 
far. So I sent it to him. Then I asked him how long time I had to 
finish it. He said 10 days. So I took a brake from the article, since 
I was rather tired. The day after, I went away to visit my son, and 
came home a few days (3 maybe?) later. Then b0g #2 was out, and b0b 
had published my unfinshed (non) article. I asked bob what the fuck 
was wrong with him, printing it and so on. He answered that he 
published b0g #2 earlier (well, so I could figure out myself) and that 
he didnt read my article. He`d just pasted it into the zine...so, 
theres the story behind it. Dont judge me nor let it affect the 
quality (ermh) of b0g for that article.

...and for all the typos, well, thats sort of the given? I`m 
norwegian, and I didnt bother to correct all the fucking foreign words 
since it was just words I wrote down to get out  ideas and such. But 
oh well, this isnt ment as an excuse, I just wanted to defend myself 
against unjustified shit talk.

So, now I hope you fucking cunts out there that misunderstood my 
article think better of me? 
I`m very loveable?
It`s true?
I think I am, at least...
§:o)

PS! I`m NOT a "satanist" since a refuse to use a word related to a 
crappy religion as christianity to describe me though many of my 
friends do. I have a great respect for LaVey satainsts. I just dont 
want to label myself to any genre.

So to Wyzewun I just want to say that I`m grateful for your honesty, 
but blame b0b for the crappy article...and if you in the future want 
to say something about my forth coming articles, please dont use words 
such as "insippid" and "stupid"?
But, thanx for saying that good stuff about b0g.
No hard feelings?
