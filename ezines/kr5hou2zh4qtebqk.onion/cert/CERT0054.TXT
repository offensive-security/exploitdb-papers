CA-92:21                      CERT Advisory
                            December 16, 1992
                ConvexOS and ConvexOS/Secure Vulnerabilities

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning
several vulnerabilities in the following CONVEX Computer Corporation
products: ConvexOS/Secure, CONVEX CXbatch, CONVEX Storage Manager
(CSM), and ConvexOS EMACS.  These vulnerabilities can affect ConvexOS
versions V6.2 - V10.2 and ConvexOS/Secure versions V9.5 and V10.0 on
all supported architectures.

CONVEX is aware of the vulnerabilities, and fixes or workarounds are
available.  Three of the fixes are implemented as full Engineering
Change Notice (ECN) patches and, as such, will be shipped with all new
systems as well as being released as upgrades for the products
CXbatch, CSM and ConvexOS/Secure.  There is a workaround available for
the ConvexOS EMACS vulnerability. CONVEX is currently incorporating
the fixes to these vulnerabilities into future releases of each
product.  Future shipments of these products should not be vulnerable
to these problems.

If you have any questions about the affected products, please contact
your CONVEX representative or the CONVEX Technical Assistance Center
(TAC) at 1-800-952-0379.
