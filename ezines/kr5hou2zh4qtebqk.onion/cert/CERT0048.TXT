CA-92:13                       CERT Advisory

                          SunOS NIS Vulnerability
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning several vulnerabilities with NIS under
Sun Microsystems, Inc. SunOS.  These vulnerabilities exist in NIS under
SunOS 4.1, 4.1.1, and 4.1.2, and may or may not exist in earlier versions
of NIS.

Sun has provided fixes for SunOS 4.1, 4.1.1, and 4.1.2 for these
vulnerabilities.  The patch file containing these fixes is available
through your local Sun Answer Center and through anonymous ftp from
ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9) in the /systems/sun/sun-dist directory.  Note
that these fixes will probably not be compatible with SunOS 4.0.3 and
earlier versions of the operating system.

/usr/etc/{ypserv,ypxfrd,portmap} 100482-2     100482-02.tar.Z     53416   284

Please note that Sun will occasionally update patch files.  If you
find that the checksum is different, please contact Sun or the CERT/CC
for verification.

I.   Description

     A security vulnerability exists under NIS allowing unauthorized access
     to NIS information.

II.  Impact

     A user on a remote host can obtain copies of the NIS maps from a
     system running NIS.  The remote user can attempt to guess passwords
     for the system using the obtained NIS password map information.

III. Solution

     A.  Obtain and install the patch from Sun or from ftp.uu.net following
         the instructions provided in the "README" file.  

         1.  As root, rename the existing versions of
             /usr/etc/{ypserv,ypxfrd,portmap} and modify the
             permissions to prevent misuse.

             # mv /usr/etc/ypserv /usr/etc/ypserv.orig
             # mv /usr/etc/ypxfrd /usr/etc/ypxfrd.orig
             # mv /usr/etc/portmap /usr/etc/portmap.orig
             # chmod 0400 /usr/etc/ypserv.orig 
             # chmod 0400 /usr/etc/ypxfrd.orig
             # chmod 0400 /usr/etc/portmap.orig

         2.  Copy the new binaries into the /usr/etc directory.

             # cp `arch`/{4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2}/ypserv /usr/etc/ypserv
             # cp `arch`/{4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2}/ypxfrd /usr/etc/ypxfrd
             # cp `arch`/{4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2}/portmap /usr/etc/portmap
             # chown root /usr/etc/ypserv /usr/etc/ypxfrd /usr/etc/portmap
             # chmod 755 /usr/etc/ypserv /usr/etc/ypxfrd /usr/etc/portmap

         3.  Copy the securenets file to the /var/yp directory.  Any
             site that has an existing /var/yp/securenets file should 
             rename it prior copying the new version of the file.

             # cp `arch`/{4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2}/securenets /var/yp
             # chown root /var/yp/securenets
             # chmod 644 /var/yp/securenets

         4.  Edit the /var/yp/securenets file to reflect the correct
             configuration for your site.  See the "README" file for
             details of the file syntax and special instructions for
             hosts with multiple Ethernet interfaces.  The file should
             not contain any blank lines.
 
         5.  Reboot the system to invoke the new binaries.
