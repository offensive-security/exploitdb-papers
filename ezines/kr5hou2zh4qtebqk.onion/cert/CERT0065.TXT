vulnerability affects NetWare 4.0 and 4.01. It does not affect NetWare 2.x,
NetWare 3.x, or Netware for UNIX.

Novell is making available a security enhancement to the login program for
NetWare 4.x. CERT strongly recommends that sites using of Novell NetWare 4.X
replace their current LOGIN.EXE program on all affected systems with this
security-enhanced version as soon as possible.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.   Description:

                                              58886 325 (System V Sum)

     This file is also available at no charge through NetWare resellers, 
     on NetWire in library 14 of the NOVLIB forum, or by calling

     Novell at +1-303-339-7027 or +31-55-384279 or may fax a request for

     The distribution SECLOG.EXE is a self-extracting archive that  
     contains a patched file and a text file of installation instructions. 
     The patch file (LOGIN.EXE) and the text file (SECLOG.TXT) are created 
     by executing the distribution file SECLOG.EXE. After extracting the 
     files, the dir command should produce the following output:

         SECLOG   EXE  166276    xx-xx-xx   xx:xxx
         LOGIN    EXE  354859    08-25-93   11:43a
         SECLOG   TXT    5299    09-02-93   11:16a

     Note that the date and time shown for SECLOG.EXE will reflect when 
     this file was created on your system.

     To install the patch, follow the directions contained in the text file
     SECLOG.TXT.

     After installing the patch, sites should instruct all users to change 
     their passwords.
