Topic: Revised Patch for SunOS /usr/etc/rpc.mountd Vulnerability
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    *** THIS IS A REVISED CERT ADVISORY ***
           *** IT CONTAINS NEW VULNERABILITY AND PATCH INFORMATION ***
             *** SUPERSEDES CERT ADVISORY CA-91:09 and CA-92:12 ***

The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning a
vulnerability in /usr/etc/rpc.mountd in Sun Microsystems, Inc. SunOS
4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.3c.  SunOS 4.1.3.u.1, Solaris 2.x, and
Solbourne's 4.1B and 4.1C are not vulnerable.

Sun has produced a patch for this vulnerability for sun3 and sun4
architectures.  It is available through your local Sun Answer Center
as well as through anonymous FTP from the ftp.uu.net system in the
/systems/sun/sun-dist directory or from the ftp.eu.net system in the
/sun/fixes directory.

This vulnerability is currently being exploited.  Please review CERT 
Advisory CA-94:01 'Ongoing Network Monitoring Attacks'.

I.   Description

     If an access list of hosts within /etc/exports is a string 
     over 256 characters or if the cached list of netgroups exceeds
     the cache capacity then the file system can be mounted by anyone.
      
II.  Impact

     Unauthorized remote hosts will be able to mount the file system.
     This will allow unauthorized users read and write access to files
     on mounted file systems.

III. Solution

     Obtain and install the appropriate patch following the instructions
     included with the patch.

     Patches are available from
        ftp://ftp.uu.net/systems/sun/sun-dist/patches/
        ftp://ftp.eu.net/sun/fixes/

     There is a README file and directory layout to help identify which
     binaries are appropriate for which architectures.
