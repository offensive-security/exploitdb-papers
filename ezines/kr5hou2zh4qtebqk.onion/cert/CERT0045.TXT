                       AIX Anonymous FTP Vulnerability

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning a vulnerability in the anonymous FTP
configuration in all versions of AIX.

IBM is aware of this problem and a fix is available as apar number
"ix23944".  This patch is available for all AIX releases from "GOLD".

IBM customers may call IBM Support (800-237-5511) and ask that the fix
be shipped to them.  Patches may be obtained outside the U.S. by contacting 
your local IBM representative.  The fix will appear in the upcoming 2009 
update and the next release of AIX.

I.   Description

     Previous versions of the anonymous FTP installation script,
     /usr/lpp/tcpip/samples/anon.ftp, incorrectly configured various files
     and directories.
     

II.  Impact

     Remote users can execute unauthorized commands and gain access to the
     system if anonymous FTP has been installed.

     A.  Obtain the fix from IBM Support.  The fix contains three
         files: a "readme" file (README.a23944), the fix installation
         script (install.a23944), and an archive containing the updated
         files (PATCH.a23944.Z).
