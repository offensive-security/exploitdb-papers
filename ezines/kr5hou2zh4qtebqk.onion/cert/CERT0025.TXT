    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sun Bug ID  : 1059621
    Synopsis    : security hole created by installing sunsrc
    Sun Patch ID: Not applicable see fix below.

    This applies to sites that have installed Sun Source tapes only.
    
    The Sun distribution of sources (sunsrc) has an installation
    procedure which creates the directory /usr/release/bin and
    installs two setuid root files in it: makeinstall and winstall.
    These are both binary files which exec other programs: "make -k install"
    (makeinstall) or "install" (winstall).

    This makes it possible for users on that system to become root.

    The solution:
        chmod ug-s /usr/release/bin/{makeinstall, winstall}
        (if the sources have already been installed)
    and/or
        edit the makefile in sunsrc/release and change the SETUID definition
        (if the sources have been extracted from tape but not installed yet)

    Special thanks to CERT and Tel-Aviv University for reporting this
    problem.
