CA-90:07                       CERT Advisory
                              October 25, 1990
                          VMS ANALYZE/PROCESS_DUMP

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT/CC has received a report of a security vulnerability which
exists under specific conditions in Digital VMS Software  (Versions 4.0
to 5.4).  The DESCRIPTION, IMPACT, SOLUTION, and CONTACT INFORMATION
sections below have been provided to the CERT/CC by the Digital Equipment
Corporation.
 
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
 
Non-privileged users can acquire system privileges through
the ANALYZE/PROCESS_DUMP routine.
 
 
IMPACT:
 
Non-privileged users who gain increased privileges might deliberately
or inadvertently affect the integrity of system information and/or
affect the integrity of the computing resource.
 
SOLUTION:
 
Digital is currently working on a permanent solution to this 
problem.  While a permanent fix is being completed, Digital 
recommends that the following actions be taken on every VMS 
system (this includes all nodes in a VAXcluster system).
 
                   
After taking the following actions, non-privileged users will not be able 
to use the ANALYZE/PROCESS_DUMP command.
 
1.  Log into the system account.
 
2.  $ SET PROC/PRIV=ALL
 
3.  a)  For VMS versions prior to V5.0,
 
        Modify SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM to include the following lines:
 
		 $ SET NOON
		 $ MCR INSTALL ANALIMDMP.EXE/DELETE
 
	as the first two commands in this file.
 
    b)  For VMS versions V5.0 and later,
 
        Modify SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM to include the following 
	lines:
 
		 $ SET NOON
		 $ MCR INSTALL ANALIMDMP.EXE/DELETE
 
	as the first two commands in this file.
 
    c)  For MicroVMS systems,
 
        The image ANALIMDMP.EXE is not installed by default, but 
        SYSTARTUP.COM contains a suggestion for installing the image if 
	you have multiple users on your system.  You must ensure that 
	this image is not installed by SYSTARTUP.COM.  You can  use the
        following command to verify that the image is not  installed:
 
		  $ MCR INSTALL ANALIMDMP/LIST
	
4.  $ MCR INSTALL ANALIMDMP/DELETE
 
    This command removes the installed image from the active system.
 
5.  (Optional) Restart your systems and verify that the image is not 
    installed using the following command:
 
		  $ MCR INSTALL ANALIMDMP/LIST
 
     You should receive a message similar to the following:
 
	%INSTALL-W-FAIL, failed to LIST entry for ANALIMDMP.EXE
	-INSTALL-E-NOKFEFND, Known File Entry not found
 
 
CONTACT INFORMATION:
 
For further questions, please contact your Digital Customer Support     
Center.
