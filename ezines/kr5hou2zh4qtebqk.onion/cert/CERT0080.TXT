Topic: ftpd Vulnerabilities
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning two
vulnerabilities in some ftpd implementations.  The first is a
vulnerability with the SITE EXEC command feature of the FTP daemon
(ftpd) found in versions of ftpd that support the SITE EXEC feature.
This vulnerability allows local or remote users to gain root access.
The second vulnerability involves a race condition found in the ftpd
implementations listed in Section I. below.  This vulnerability allows
local users to gain root access.

Sites using these implementations are vulnerable even if they do not
support anonymous FTP.

As these vulnerabilities are widely known, we strongly recommend that any
site running a version of ftpd listed below take steps to immediately
upgrade or disable their FTP daemon.  Also potentially at risk are
sites whose ftpd is derived from the DECWRL or wuarchive ftpd code
containing the SITE EXEC feature.

For additional information or assistance, contact the developer or
vendor of your ftpd implementation.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information.
Please check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     There is a vulnerability in the SITE EXEC command feature of
     ftpd that allows any remote or local user to obtain root access.
     There is also a vulnerability due to a race condition in these
     implementations. 

     Versions known to be vulnerable to these problems are:
          wuarchive ftpd versions 2.0-2.3 (version 2.2 patched the
               SITE EXEC problem, but not the race condition)
          DECWRL ftpd versions prior 5.93
          BSDI ftpd version 1.1 prior to patch 5

     The SITE EXEC vulnerability affects your ftpd only if the SITE
     EXEC command feature has been explicitly activated at your site.
     This functionality is not activated by default.  Sites that have
     not enabled the SITE EXEC feature are not at risk from this
     vulnerability.  However, since the race condition does not have
     an easily applied workaround, CERT recommends that you upgrade to
     one of the versions listed below.

II.  Impact

     Anyone (remote or local) can gain root access on a host running a
     vulnerable FTP daemon.  Support for anonymous FTP is not required
     to exploit this vulnerability.


III. Solution

     Affected sites can solve both of these problems by upgrading to
     the latest version of ftpd. These versions are listed below. Be
     certain to verify the checksum information to confirm that you
     have retrieved a valid copy.

     If you cannot install the new version in a timely manner, you
     should disable FTP service until you have corrected this problem.
     It is not sufficient to disable anonymous FTP.  You must disable
     the FTP daemon.

     For wuarchive ftpd, you can obtain version 2.4 via anonymous
     FTP from wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the "/packages/wuarchive-ftpd"
     directory.  If you are currently running version 2.3, a patch
     file is available.

     For DECWRL ftpd, sites can obtain version 5.93 via anonymous FTP
     from gatekeeper.dec.com in the "/pub/misc/vixie" directory.

     For BSDI systems, patch 005 should be applied to version 1.1 of
     the BSD/386 software.  You can obtain the patch file via
     anonymous FTP from ftp.bsdi.com in the "/bsdi/patches-1.1"
     directory.
