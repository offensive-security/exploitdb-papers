- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning a
vulnerability in versions of wuarchive ftpd available before April 8,
1993.  Vulnerable wuarchive ftpd versions were available from
wuarchive.wustl.edu:/packages/ftpd.wuarchive.shar and many other
anonymous FTP sites.

We strongly recommend that any site using versions of wuarchive ftpd 
dating prior to April 8, 1993, immediately take corrective action or 
remove this service.

I.   Description

     A vulnerability exists in the access control mechanism in this 
     version of ftpd.
     
II.  Impact

     Anyone (remote or local) can potentially gain access to any 
     account including root on a host running this version of ftpd.

III. Solution 

     Affected sites may choose to disable anonymous FTP service until
     they have corrected this problem.
        
     Affected sites can correct this problem through one of the
     following two procedures:

     A. A new version of ftpd has been released that provides new features
