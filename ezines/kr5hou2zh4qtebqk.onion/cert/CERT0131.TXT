Topic: Denial-of-Service Attack via ping
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a denial-of-service
attack using large ICMP datagrams. Exploitation details involving this
vulnerability have been widely distributed.

The CERT/CC team recommends installing vendor patches as they become
available.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information. Please
check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.   Description

     The TCP/IP specification (the basis for many protocols used on the
     Internet) allows for a maximum packet size of up to 65536 octets (1 octet
     = 8 bits of data), containing a minimum of 20 octets of IP header
     information and 0 or more octets of optional information, with the rest
     of the packet being data. It is known that some systems will react in an
     unpredictable fashion when receiving oversized IP packets. Reports
     indicate a range of reactions including crashing, freezing, and
     rebooting.

     In particular, the reports received by the CERT Coordination Center
     indicate that Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets issued via
     the "ping" command have been used to trigger this behavior. ICMP is a
     subset of the TCP/IP suite of protocols that transmits error and control
     messages between systems. Two specific instances of the ICMP are the ICMP
     ECHO_REQUEST and ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE datagrams. These two instances can be
     used by a local host to determine whether a remote system is reachable
     via the network; this is commonly achieved using the "ping" command.

     Discussion in public forums has centered around the use of the "ping"
     command to construct oversized ICMP datagrams (which are encapsulated
     within an IP packet). Many ping implementations by default send ICMP
     datagrams consisting only of the 8 octets of ICMP header information but
     allow the user to specify a larger packet size if desired.

     You can read more information about this vulnerability on Mike
     Bremford's Web page. (Note that this is not a CERT/CC maintained
     page. We provide the URL here for your convenience.)

            http://www.sophist.demon.co.uk/ping/index.html

II.  Impact

     Systems receiving oversized ICMP datagrams may crash, freeze, or
     reboot, resulting in denial of service.

III. Solution

     First, since crashing a router or firewall may be part of a larger,
     multistage attack scenario, we encourage you to inspect the running
     configuration of any such systems that have crashed to ensure that the
     configuration information is what you expect it to be.

     Then install a patch from your vendor.

     Below is a list of vendors who have provided information about
     patches for this problem. Details are in Appendix A of this
     advisory; we will update the appendix as we receive more
     information. If your vendor's name is not on this list, please
     contact the vendor directly.

Appendix A - Vendor Information

Below is a list of the vendors who have provided information for this
advisory. We will update this appendix as we receive additional information.
If you do not see your vendor's name, please contact the vendor directly.


Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDI)
=====================================
  BSD/OS 2.1 is not vulnerable to this problem.  It correctly handles
  large packets without any problems.


Computer Associates, Intl.
==========================
(products for NCR)

   Not vulnerable.


Cray Research
=============
  Attempts to send oversized ICMP datagrams are rejected with
  appropriate error messages.  We believe that oversized ICMP datagrams
  sent to Unicos systems will also be rejected without crashing.


Data General Corporation
========================
  Due to the way DG/UX processes tcp packets, DG/UX is not vulnerable to
  this attack.


Digital Equipment Corporation
=============================
  MSG ID: SSRT0429 From DSNlink/DIA Database

  ADVISORY INFORMATION:

     Digital recently discovered a potential denial of service issue that
     may occur by remote systems exploiting a recently published problem while
     executing the 'ping' command. Solutions and initial communications
     began appearing in DSNlink/DIA FLASH/articles in late October, 1996.

Linux Systems
=============

  We recommend that you upgrade your Linux 1.3.x and 2.0.x kernels to Linux
  2.0.27. This is available from all the main archive sites such as

        ftp://ftp.cs.helsinki.fi/pub/Software/Linux

  Users wishing to remain with an earlier kernel version may download a
  patch from http://www.uk.linux.org/big-ping-patch. This patch will work with
  2.0.x kernel revisions but is untested with 1.3.x kernel revisions.

  Red Hat Linux has chosen to issue a 2.0.18 based release with the fix. Red
  Hat users should obtain this from
