CA-92:15                        CERT Advisory
                                July 21, 1992
                    Multiple SunOS Vulnerabilities Patched

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            *** This advisory supersedes CA-91:16. ***

The CERT/CC (Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center) has
received information concerning several vulnerabilities in the Sun
Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) operating system (SunOS).  These vulnerabilities 
affect all architectures and supported versions of SunOS including 4.1, 
4.1.1, and 4.1.2 on sun3, sun3x, sun4, sun4c, and sun4m.  The patches have 
been released as upgrades to three existing patch files.

Since application of these patches involves rebuilding your system kernel 
file (/vmunix), it is recommended that you apply all patches simultaneously.
Use the procedure described below to apply the patches and rebuild the kernel.

Sun has provided patches for these vulnerabilities as updates to
Patch IDs 100173, 100376, and 100567. They are available through your local
Sun Answer Centers worldwide as well as through anonymous ftp from the 
ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9) system (in the /systems/sun/sun-dist directory).

Fix                     Patch ID       Filename            Checksum
NFS Jumbo               100173-08    100173-08.tar.Z      32716   562

Please note that Sun Microsystems sometimes updates patch files.  If you 
find that the checksum is different please contact Sun Microsystems or CERT 
for verification.

NFS jumbo patch upgrade, SunOS 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, all architectures

I.   Description

     The upgrade to the NFS Jumbo patch addresses a vulnerability that
     allows an intruder to become root using NFS.  This vulnerability
     affects all architectures and supported versions of SunOS.
     
II.  Impact

     A remote user may exploit this vulnerability to gain root access.

III. Solution 

     Extract the new files to be installed in the kernel.

     Install the patch files in /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ as described in the
     README file included in the patch file.  Be sure to make a backup
     of each of the files you are replacing before moving the patched
     file to the /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ directory.

     Config, make, and install the new kernel to include all patches
     described in this advisory appropriate to your system.  Reboot
     each host using the appropriate kernel.  Refer to the Systems and
     Network Administration manual for instructions on building and
     configuring a new custom kernel.


Integer mul/div patch upgrade, SunOS 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, SPARC architectures

I.   Description

     The integer mul/div patch upgrade addresses an additional problem with
     the integer multiplication emulation code on SPARC architectures that
     allows an intruder to become root.  This vulnerability affects SPARC
     architectures (sun4, sun4c, and sun4m) for all supported versions of
     SunOS (4.1, 4.1.1, and 4.1.2).
     
II.  Impact

     A local user may exploit a bug in the emulation routines to gain
     root access or crash the system.

III. Solution 

     Extract the new files to be installed in the kernel.  Note that
     this patch applies only to SPARC architectures.

     Install the patch files in /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ as described in the
     README file included in the patch file.  Be sure to make a backup
     of each of the files you are replacing before moving the patched
     file to the /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ directory.

     Config, make, and install the new kernel to include all patches
     described in this advisory appropriate to your system.  Reboot
     each host using the appropriate kernel.  Refer to the Systems and
     Network Administration manual for instructions on building and
     configuring a new custom kernel.


ICMP redirects patch upgrade, SunOS 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, all architectures

I.   Description

     The ICMP redirects patch addresses a denial of service vulnerability 
     with SunOS that allows an intruder to close existing network
     connections to and from a Sun system.  This vulnerability affects all
     Sun architectures and supported versions of SunOS.
     
II.  Impact

     A remote user may deny network services on a Sun system.

III. Solution

     Extract the new file to be installed in the kernel (the patch is
     the same for all supported versions of SunOS).

     Install the patch files in /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ as described in the
     README file included in the patch file.  Be sure to make a backup
     of each of the files you are replacing before moving the patched
     file to the /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ directory.
 
     Config, make, and install the new kernel to include all patches
     described in this advisory appropriate to your system.  Reboot
     each host using the appropriate kernel.  Refer to the Systems and
     Network Administration manual for instructions on building and
      configuring a new custom kernel.
