CA-92:01                        CERT Advisory
                              January 20, 1992
                     NeXTstep Configuration Vulnerability

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC)  
has received information concerning a vulnerability in release 2 of
NeXTstep's NetInfo default configuration.  This vulnerability will
be corrected in future versions of NeXTstep.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     By default, a NetInfo server process will provide information to
     any machine that requests it.


II.  Impact

     Remote users can gain unauthorized access to the network's
     administrative information such as the passwd file.


III. Solution

     Ensure that the trusted_networks property of each NetInfo domain's
     root NetInfo directory is set correctly, so that only those systems
     which should be obtaining information from NetInfo are granted
     access. The value for the trusted_networks property should be the
     network numbers of the networks the server should trust.

     Note that improperly setting trusted_networks can render your
     network unusable.

     Consult Chapter 16, "Security", of the "NeXT Network and System
     Administration" manual for release 2 for details on setting the
     trusted_networks property of the root NetInfo directory.
