CA-92:18		     CERT Advisory
			   November 17, 1992
		    Revised VMS Monitor Vulnerability 

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
				   
	       *** THIS IS A REVISED CERT ADVISORY ***
*** IT CONTAINS NEW INFORMATION REGARDING AVAILABILITY OF IMAGE KITS ***
	      *** SUPERSEDES CERT ADVISORY CA-92:16 ***


The CERT Coordination Center received information concerning a
potential vulnerability with Digital Equipment Corporation's VMS
Monitor. This vulnerability is present in V5.0 through V5.4-2 but has
been corrected in V5.4-3 through V5.5-1.  The Software Security 
Response Team at Digital has provided the following information
concerning this vulnerability.

The remedial image kit was not available at the time CERT distributed
the CA-92:16.VMS.monitor.vulnerability advisory (dated September 22,
1992).  At that time, Digital strongly suggested that customers either
upgrade to VMS V5.4-3 (preferably to V5.5-1) or implement the provided
workaround if unable to upgrade.

The following SSRT-200-1 addendum contains information about the
availability of new images to address the possible vulnerability with
VMS Monitor.

This last and final addendum includes new information about remedial
images for VMS V5.0 through V5.4-2.
 
Digital strongly suggests that those customers who were unable to
upgrade their systems (i.e., VMS V5.0 through V5.4-2) obtain and
install the remedial image kit on their system(s).

For additional information, please contact your normal Digital 
Services Support Organization.

PROBLEM/IMPACT:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Unauthorized privileges may be expanded to authorized users of a system
     under certain conditions, via the Monitor utility.   Should a system be
     compromised through unauthorized access, there is a risk of potential
     damage to a system environment.  This problem will not permit unauthorized
     access entry, as individuals attempting to gain unauthorized access will
     continue to be denied through the standard VMS security mechanisms.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This potential vulnerability does not exist in VMS V5.4-3
     (released in October 1991) and later versions of VMS through V5.5-1.

     Digital strongly recommends that you upgrade to a minimum of VMS V5.4-3,
     and further, to the latest release of VMS V5.5-1. (released in July, 1992)
