CA-91:21                     CERT Advisory
                            December 6, 1991
		  SunOS NFS Jumbo and fsirand Patches

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC)
has received information concerning several vulnerabilities in Sun
Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) Network File System (NFS) and the fsirand
program. These vulnerabilities affect SunOS versions 4.1.1, 4.1, and
4.0.3 on all architectures.

Sun has provided separate patches for these vulnerabilities for SunOS
4.1.1, and has provided an initial patch for SunOS 4.1.  Sun will be
providing complete patches for 4.1 and 4.0.3 at a later date.  On
SunOS 4.1.1 systems, Sun states that patch 100173-07 must be installed
before patch 100424-1.  The patches are available through your local
Sun Answer Centers worldwide as well as through anonymous ftp from the
ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.2) system in the /sun-dist directory.

Fix                        PatchID        Filename            Checksum

Please note that Sun will occasionally update patch files.  If you
find that the checksum is different please contact Sun or the CERT/CC
for verification.

Sun recommends that sites upgrade to SunOS 4.1.1 to benefit from the
security improvements.  In addition, they recommend the installation
of all security-related patches applicable to the version of SunOS
that you are running.

A general NFS security note: due to security flaws in the protocol,
the CERT/CC recommends filtering SunRPC and NFS IP packets (sockets
111 and 2049) between the local network and the Internet.  This will
prevent intruders outside your local network from accessing your
files.
