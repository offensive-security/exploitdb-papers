================== Hacking and hackers explained ===========================

Dear Editor: 
This letter is not meant for publication, although you can publish it if 
you wish. It is meant specifically for you, the editor, not the public. 

I am a hacker. That is to say, I enjoy playing with computers -- working with, 
learning about, and writing clever computer programs. I am not a cracker; I 
don't make a practice of breaking computer security. 

There's nothing shameful about the hacking I do. But when I tell people I am 
a hacker, people think I'm admitting something naughty -- because newspapers 
such as yours misuse the word "hacker", giving the impression that it means 
"security breaker" and nothing else. You are giving hackers a bad name. 

The saddest thing is that this problem is perpetuated deliberately. Your 
reporters know the difference between "hacker" and "security breaker". 
They know how to make the distinction, but you don't let them! You insist 
on using "hacker" pejoratively. When reporters try to use another word, 
you change it. When reporters try to explain the other meanings, you cut 
it. 

Of course, you have a reason. You say that readers have become used to your 
insulting usage of "hacker", so that you cannot change it now. Well, you 
can't undo past mistakes today; but that is no excuse to repeat them tomorrow. 

If I were what you call a "hacker", at this point I would threaten to crack 
your computer and crash it. But I am a hacker, not a cracker. I don't do 
that kind of thing! I have enough computers to play with at home and at work; 
I don't need yours. Besides, it's not my way to respond to insults with 
violence. My response is this letter. 

You owe hackers an apology; but more than that, you owe us ordinary respect. 

Sincerely, etc.

A Portrait of J. Random Hacker
This profile reflects detailed comments on an earlier `trial balloon' version 
from about a hundred Usenet respondents. Where comparatives are used, the 
implicit `other' is a randomly selected segment of the non-hacker population 
of the same size as hackerdom. 

An important point: Except in some relatively minor respects such as slang 
vocabulary, hackers don't get to be the way they are by imitating each other. 
Rather, it seems to be the case that the combination of personality traits 
that makes a hacker so conditions one's outlook on life that one tends to end 
up being like other hackers whether one wants to or not (much as bizarrely 
detailed similarities in behavior and preferences are found in genetic twins 
raised separately). 

---

General Appearance
Intelligent. Scruffy. Intense. Abstracted. Surprisingly for a sedentary 
profession, more hackers run to skinny than fat; both extremes are more 
common than elsewhere. Tans are rare. 

---

Dress
Casual, vaguely post-hippie; T-shirts, jeans, running shoes, Birkenstocks 
(or bare feet). Long hair, beards, and moustaches are common. High incidence 
of tie-dye and intellectual or humorous `slogan' T-shirts (only rarely 
computer related; that would be too obvious). 

A substantial minority prefers `outdoorsy' clothing -- hiking boots ("in 
case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the machine room", as one 
famous parody put it), khakis, lumberjack or chamois shirts, and the like. 

Very few actually fit the "National Lampoon" Nerd stereotype, though it 
lingers on at MIT and may have been more common before 1975. At least 
since the late Seventies backpacks have been more common than briefcases, 
and the hacker `look' has been more whole-earth than whole-polyester. 

Hackers dress for comfort, function, and minimal maintenance hassles rather 
than for appearance (some, perhaps unfortunately, take this to extremes and 
neglect personal hygiene). They have a very low tolerance of suits and other 
`business' attire; in fact, it is not uncommon for hackers to quit a job 
rather than conform to a dress code. 

Female hackers almost never wear visible makeup, and many use none at all. 

---

Reading Habits
Omnivorous, but usually includes lots of science and science fiction. The 
typical hacker household might subscribe to "Analog", "Scientific American", 
"Whole-Earth Review", and "Smithsonian" (most hackers ignore "Wired" and 
other self-consciously `cyberpunk' magazines, considering them wannabee fodder). 
Hackers often have a reading range that astonishes liberal arts people but tend 
not to talk about it as much. Many hackers spend as much of their spare time 
reading as the average American burns up watching TV, and often keep shelves 
and shelves of well-thumbed books in their homes. 

---

Other Interests
Some hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the culture: science 
fiction, music, medievalism (in the active form practiced by the Society for 
Creative Anachronism and similar organizations), chess, go, backgammon, wargames, 
and intellectual games of all kinds. (Role-playing games such as Dungeons and 
Dragons used to be extremely popular among hackers but they lost a bit of their 
luster as they moved into the mainstream and became heavily commercialized. 
More recently, "Magic: The Gathering" has been widely popular among hackers.) 
Logic puzzles. Ham radio. Other interests that seem to correlate less strongly 
but positively with hackerdom include linguistics and theater teching. 

---

Physical Activity and Sports
Many (perhaps even most) hackers don't follow or do sports at all and are 
determinedly anti-physical. Among those who do, interest in spectator sports 
is low to non-existent; sports are something one does, not something one 
watches on TV. 

Further, hackers avoid most team sports like the plague. Volleyball was 
long a notable exception, perhaps because it's non-contact and relatively 
friendly; Ultimate Frisbee has become quite popular for similar reasons. 
Hacker sports are almost always primarily self-competitive ones involving 
concentration, stamina, and micromotor skills: martial arts, bicycling, 
auto racing, kite flying, hiking, rock climbing, aviation, target-shooting, 
sailing, caving, juggling, skiing, skating, skydiving, scuba diving. Hackers' 
delight in techno-toys also tends to draw them towards hobbies with nifty 
complicated equipment that they can tinker with. 

The popularity of martial arts in the hacker culture deserves special mention. 
Many observers have noted it, and the connection has grown noticeably stronger 
over time. In the 1970s, many hackers admired martial arts disciplines from a
distance, sensing a compatible ideal in their exaltation of skill through 
rigorous self-discipline and concentration. As martial arts became increasingly 
mainstreamed in the U.S. and other western countries, hackers moved from 
admiring to doing in large numbers. In 1997, for example, your humble editor 
recalls sitting down with five strangers at the first Perl conference and 
discovering that four of us were in active training in some sort of martial art - 
and, what is more interesting, nobody at the table found this particularly odd. 

Today (2000), martial arts seems to have become established as the hacker exercise 
form of choice, and the martial-arts culture combining skill-centered elitism with 
a willingness to let anybody join seems a stronger parallel to hacker behavior 
than ever. Common usages in hacker slang un-ironically analogize programming to 
kung fu (thus, one hears talk of "code-fu" or in reference to specific skills like 
"HTML-fu"). Albeit with slightly more irony, today's hackers readily analogize 
assimilation into the hacker culture with the plot of a Jet Li movie: the aspiring 
newbie studies with masters of the tradition, develops his art through deep 
meditation, ventures forth to perform heroic feats of hacking, and eventually 
becomes a master who trains the next generation of newbies. 

---

Education
Nearly all hackers past their teens are either college-degreed or self-educated to 
an equivalent level. The self-taught hacker is often considered (at least by other 
hackers) to be better-motivated, and may be more respected, than his school-shaped 
counterpart. Academic areas from which people often gravitate into hackerdom include 
(besides the obvious computer science and electrical engineering) physics, 
mathematics, linguistics, and philosophy. 

---

Things Hackers Detest and Avoid
IBM mainframes. All the works of Microsoft. Smurfs, Ewoks, and other forms of 
offensive cuteness. Bureaucracies. Stupid people. Easy listening music. 
Television (with occasional exceptions for cartoons, movies, and good SF 
like "Star Trek" or Babylon 5). Business suits. Dishonesty. Incompetence. 
Boredom. COBOL. BASIC. Character-based menu interfaces.

---

Food
Ethnic. Spicy. Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan, Hunan, and 
Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely déclassé). Hackers prefer 
the exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among them will eat with 
gusto such delicacies as fugu (poisonous pufferfish) and whale. Thai 
food has experienced flurries of popularity. Where available, high-quality 
Jewish delicatessen food is much esteemed. A visible minority of 
Southwestern and Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican. 

For those all-night hacks, pizza and microwaved burritos are big. 
Interestingly, though the mainstream culture has tended to think of 
hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have at least mildly 
health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about what they 
eat. This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the 
stereotype was more on the mark before the early 1980s. 

---

Politics
Vaguely liberal-moderate, except for the strong libertarian contingent 
which rejects conventional left-right politics entirely. The only safe 
generalization is that hackers tend to be rather anti-authoritarian; 
thus, both conventional conservatism and `hard' leftism are rare. Hackers 
are far more likely than most non-hackers to either (a) be aggressively 
apolitical or (b) entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic political ideas 
and actually try to live by them day-to-day. 

---

Gender and Ethnicity
Hackerdom is still predominantly male. However, the percentage of women 
is clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for technical 
professions, and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with 
as equals. 

In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong minorities 
of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast). The Jewish contingent 
has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence (see Food, above, 
and note that several common jargon terms are obviously mutated Yiddish). 

The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a function 
of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education. Racial and ethnic 
prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing contempt. 

When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and color-blindness 
to a positive effect of text-only network channels, and this is doubtless a
powerful influence. Also, the ties many hackers have to AI research and SF 
literature may have helped them to develop an idea of personhood that is 
inclusive rather than exclusive -- after all, if one's imagination readily 
grants full human rights to future AI programs, robots, dolphins, and 
extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender can't seem very important 
any more. 

---

Religion
Agnostic. Atheist. Non-observant Jewish. Neo-pagan. Very commonly, three 
or more of these are combined in the same person. Conventional faith-holding 
Christianity is rare though not unknown.

Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be relaxed 
about it, hostile to organized religion in general and all forms of religious 
bigotry in particular. Many enjoy `parody' religions such as Discordianism 
and the Church of the SubGenius.

Also, many hackers are influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism or 
(less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with their `native' religions.

There is a definite strain of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility that 
shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with neo-paganism, 
Discordianism, or Zen. Hacker folklore that pays homage to `wizards' and 
speaks of incantations and demons has too much psychological truthfulness 
about it to be entirely a joke.

---

Ceremonial Chemicals
Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at all. 
However, there has been something of a trend towards exotic beers since 
about 1995, especially among younger Linux hackers apparently influenced 
by Linus Torvalds's fondness for Guiness.

Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD, 
psilocybin, nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is 
still regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream culture. Use 
of `downers' and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be particularly
rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that make them stupid. 
But on the gripping hand, many hackers regularly wire up on caffeine 
and/or sugar for all-night hacking runs.

---

Communication Style
See the discussions of speech and writing styles near the beginning of 
this File. Though hackers often have poor person-to-person communication 
skills, they are as a rule quite sensitive to nuances of language and 
very precise in their use of it. They are often better at writing than 
at speaking.

---

Geographical Distribution
In the United States, hackerdom revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis; 
about half of the hard core seems to live within a hundred miles of 
Cambridge (Massachusetts) or Berkeley (California), although there are 
significant contingents in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Northwest, and 
around Washington DC. Hackers tend to cluster around large cities, 
especially `university towns' such as the Raleigh-Durham area in North 
Carolina or Princeton, New Jersey (this may simply reflect the fact that 
many are students or ex-students living near their alma maters).

---

Sexual Habits
Hackerdom easily tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle 
variation than the mainstream culture. It includes a relatively large 
gay and bisexual contingent. Hackers are somewhat more likely to live 
in polygynous or polyandrous relationships, practice open marriage, or 
live in communes or group houses. In this, as in general appearance, 
hackerdom semi-consciously maintains `counterculture' values.

---

Personality Characteristics
The most obvious common `personality' characteristics of hackers are 
high intelligence, consuming curiosity, and facility with intellectual 
abstractions. Also, most hackers are `neophiles', stimulated by and 
appreciative of novelty (especially intellectual novelty). Most are 
also relatively individualistic and anti-conformist.

Although high general intelligence is common among hackers, it is 
not the sine qua non one might expect. Another trait is probably even 
more important: the ability to mentally absorb, retain, and reference 
large amounts of `meaningless' detail, trusting to later experience to 
give it context and meaning. A person of merely average analytical 
intelligence who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but 
a creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced 
by people who routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals 
into their brains. [During the production of the first book version of 
this document, for example, I learned most of the rather complex 
typesetting language TeX over about four working days, mainly by inhaling 
Knuth's 477-page manual. My editor's flabbergasted reaction to this 
genuinely surprised me, because years of associating with hackers have 
conditioned me to consider such performances routine and to be expected. 
--ESR]

Contrary to stereotype, hackers are not usually intellectually narrow; 
they tend to be interested in any subject that can provide mental 
stimulation, and can often discourse knowledgeably and even interestingly 
on any number of obscure subjects -- if you can get them to talk at all, 
as opposed to, say, going back to their hacking.

It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the 
better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have 
outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent.

Hackers are `control freaks' in a way that has nothing to do with the 
usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term. In the same 
way that children delight in making model trains go forward and back 
by moving a switch, hackers love making complicated things like 
computers do nifty stuff for them. But it has to be their nifty stuff. 
They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring, 
ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence. 
Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual 
lives and chaotic elsewhere. Their code will be beautiful, even if 
their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap.

Hackers are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional rewards 
such as social approval or money. They tend to be attracted by challenges 
and excited by interesting toys, and to judge the interest of work or 
other activities in terms of the challenges offered and the toys they 
get to play with.

In terms of Myers-Briggs and equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom 
appears to concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is, 
introverted, intuitive, and thinker types (as opposed to the 
extroverted-sensate personalities that predominate in the mainstream 
culture). ENT[JP] types are also concentrated among hackers but are 
in a minority. 

---

Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality
Hackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with other 
people. This may be because hackers generally aren't much like `other 
people'. Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend towards self-absorption, 
intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people and tasks perceived 
to be wasting their time. 

As cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the world, 
they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational, `cool', and 
imaginative as they consider themselves. This bias often contributes to 
weakness in communication skills. Hackers tend to be especially poor at 
confrontation and negotiation. 

Because of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the 
Right Thing, hackers can be unfortunately intolerant and bigoted on 
technical issues, in marked contrast to their general spirit of camaraderie 
and tolerance of alternative viewpoints otherwise. Old-time ITS partisans 
look down on the ever-growing hordes of Unix hackers; Unix aficionados 
despise VMS and MS-DOS; and hackers who are used to conventional 
command-line user interfaces loudly loathe mouse-and-menu based systems 
such as the Macintosh. Hackers who don't indulge in Usenet consider it a 
huge waste of time and bandwidth; fans of old adventure games such as 
ADVENT and Zork consider MUDs to be glorified chat systems devoid of 
atmosphere or interesting puzzles; hackers who are willing to devote 
endless hours to Usenet or MUDs consider IRC to be a real waste of time; 
IRCies think MUDs might be okay if there weren't all those silly puzzles 
in the way. And, of course, there are the perennial holy wars -- EMACS vs. 
vi, big-endian vs. little-endian, RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc., etc. As in 
society at large, the intensity and duration of these debates is usually 
inversely proportional to the number of objective, factual arguments 
available to buttress any position. 

As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty maintaining 
stable relationships. At worst, they can produce the classic computer geek: 
withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually frustrated, and desperately 
unhappy when not submerged in his or her craft. Fortunately, this extreme 
is far less common than mainstream folklore paints it -- but almost all 
hackers will recognize something of themselves in the unflattering 
paragraphs above. 

Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing with 
the physical world. Bills don't get paid on time, clutter piles up to 
incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance tasks get 
deferred indefinitely.

1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a syndrome called Attention Deficit 
Disorder (ADD), supposedly characterized by (among other things) a 
combination of short attention span with an ability to `hyperfocus' 
imaginatively on interesting tasks. In 1998-1999 another syndrome that is 
said to overlap with many hacker traits entered popular awareness: Asperger's 
syndrome (AS). This disorder is also sometimes called `high-function autism', 
though researchers are divided on whether AS is in fact a mild form of 
autism or a distinct syndrome with a different etiology. AS patients 
exhibit mild to severe deficits in interpreting facial and body-language 
cues and in modeling or empathizing with others' emotions. Though some 
AS patients exhibit mild retardation, others compensate for their 
deficits with high intelligence and analytical ability, and frequently 
seek out technical fields where problem-solving abilities are at a 
premium and people skills are relatively unimportant. Both syndromes 
are thought to relate to abnormalities in neurotransmitter chemistry, 
especially the brain's processing of serotonin.

Many hackers have noticed that mainstream culture has shown a tendency 
to pathologize and medicalize normal variations in personality, especially 
those variations that make life more complicated for authority figures 
and conformists. Thus, hackers aware of the issue tend to be among those 
questioning whether ADD and AS actually exist; and if so whether they 
are really `diseases' rather than extremes of a normal genetic variation 
like having freckles or being able to taste DPT. In either case, they 
have a sneaking tendency to wonder if these syndromes are over-diagnosed 
and over-treated. After all, people in authority will always be 
inconvenienced by schoolchildren or workers or citizens who are prickly, 
intelligent individualists - thus, any social system that depends on 
authority relationships will tend to helpfully ostracize and therapize 
and drug such `abnormal' people until they are properly docile and 
stupid and `well-socialized'.

So hackers tend to believe they have good reason for skepticism about 
clinical explanations of the hacker personality. That being said, most 
would also concede that some hacker traits coincide with indicators for 
ADD and AS - the status of caffeeine as a hacker beverage of choice may 
be connected to the fact that it bonds to the same neural receptors as 
Ritalin, the drug most commonly prescribed for ADD. It is probably true 
that boosters of both would find a rather higher rate of clinical ADD 
among hackers than the supposedly mainstream-normal 3-5% (AS is rarer 
and there are not yet good estimates of incidence as of 2000).

Miscellaneous
Hackers are more likely to have cats than dogs (in fact, it is widely 
grokked that cats have the hacker nature). Many drive incredibly decrepit 
heaps and forget to wash them; richer ones drive spiffy Porsches and 
RX-7s and then forget to have them washed. Almost all hackers have 
terribly bad handwriting, and often fall into the habit of 
block-printing everything like junior draftsmen.
