***MAN EATEN BY LARGE CANOE***
(APWN)Quinektukut-- Holy Fuckin Shit!
  Those tiny little waves wailed on me.
  The boy scouts taught me how to paddle on a lake. I was NOT prepared for my
canoe ride in Mystic Harbour this morning. Not at all.
  I think I travelled about 800 feet in an hour flat. My hands are still soaki
wet. Wet from all the hard splash I had to do just to keep inside the Grumman.
I'm facing away from this post I tied onto.
  I am going NOWHERE.
  Yet this landlubber still must look back behind him to reassure he's not
going to smash into the pole he's tied onto.
  Pure science is that he's being pulled away from the post constantly.
However eyes and settling stomach tell him the opposite.
  You look down beside you and you're travelling about 3 MPH backwards.  Look
anywhere else, you're going nowhere fast.
  Triceps are severely pumped. Feet and ankles are torn to shreds. Driving an
'87 Chevy S-10, you dont know what a struggle is.
  Step onto the back of this Canoe and I will relax in front of you...
watching. Waiting patiently as you throw your paddle around fighting the
quarter-inch waves.
  Humbling.

To the tune of HARD DAY'S NIGHT BY The Beatles
It's been a one horse town
And I been lookin for escape
It's been a one horse town
And all the girls here look like apes.

But when I get home to you,
Who knows just what I might do
To make me feel all right.

You know I hate this place,
It's just filled with pencil-necks.
And it's worth it just to try crochet,
Who knows what I might try next.

But when I get to the bars,
All I can smell is cigars,
I need to feel alright.

  I'm sick and foggin tired of catagorizations and compartmental- izations.
  This is one of the few (3 or 4) negative things I've seen to come from
computer use/abuse/consumption/ digestion.
  "Do you use a commodore or an atari?" was the common thought among 8bitters.
It hasnt stopped. In fact, even between the 16/32's like the ST or the Amoeba,
you see a lot of infighting. Is your modem Hayes or blah mode? 12 or 24 hundre
nibbles per nanosecond? Is your screen 80 or 132 column?
  Even among the elite, I have seen some stupid generalizations/judgments/
eyeball-chewing. Are you a hacker or a phreaker? Telenet or Tymnet? Unix or
Zenix?
  What this essay is trying to get across by the end of its writing is this: I
DOESNT FUGGIHM MATTER!!!
  I've seen a bright individ on an apple 2+ get more resultz on my BBS than an
Amy 2000er!!! I've seen an 8bitter do power-more than your basic mac 2 freak.
  Cygnus has a good analagy for us all.  It aint the machine, says he. It's th
operator. I wonder if he still feels that way now that he's moved from his cp/
on up to the amy 500???
  I bought my first computator for one thing only. WP!!! (word processing). It
was a portable computer that I could bring to the ball park, jot down a few
things, and then go home and print it out.
  Then I got a desktop kind of thing that could rest at home, and be there whe
I wake up. Sort of like a wife.  Hmmm. Somewhere before that, I already found
how I could get the two together. Then along came a nice 3/12 modem for my
desktop. Thanks to that educated 60 dollar decision, I can now grab a soda at
that ballpark, and set my laptop on the payphone and send the stuff to my
desktop.
  Something I want you to work on.
  STOP FIGHTING AMONGST YOURSELVES AND START MOVING TECHNOLOGY FORWARD instead
of worrying whether someone is a commie/atarian/amoebite/applehead/ Ibeamer.

CITICORPSE. A COMPANY WITH
NO RAISEN D'ETRE.
()--------------------------

  Citibank has purchased the First Republic Bank Delaware for 158MIL.
  They closed their venture capital unit in California in may and are now
reorganizing into two unita: venture capital, and leveraged buyouts.
  For the year 1987 their operating expenses was 8M. They paid 15.5M in
interest against interest income of 22M. Other income was 6 against 4.5 in
expenses.
  For some strange reason, their taxable income was only $240 thousand dollars
  Citibank declared a net loss of $1,138,000 for '87!!! Citibank owes 12
thousand to repurchase agreements, 11K to borrowed funds, 16K to their parent
company, Citicorpse, 5K to their subsidiaries.
  According to sources, Citibank is party to various viscious lawsuits.
  Citibank's '87 loan loss provision was increased almost 2 1/2 times what it
was in 1986, reflecting the uncertainty of fully collecting loans made to the
3rd world. The allowance for loan losses went from 1.2 billion to 4 billion
dollars.
  And the man responsible for all this?  John S. Reed. Call him up on the
tellie and let him know what you think of how he's helped America get from a 1
trillion dollar debtor nation to a 2.6 trillion debtor in just 7 years!!!

 I would like to introduce myself, you might have wondered who I was, or what
relation I had to ATI. Not much actually, as a friend of Prime anarchist's and
as a fellow telecom weirdo, I saw and helped edit some of the issues (and lose
a few of them to the magical wonder of the disk god, only to be resurected
using the help of the disk sector editor ...Number 9....Number 9.... ).
  I am not politically active, I am not socially active either. I proscribe to
no particular ideology,philosophy, or religion. I simply observe things that I
experience and try to understand them objectively (or subjectively ,depending
on what mood I am in). You will be seeing alot of me in upcoming issues.  I
hope to display pros and cons of differant beliefs. I wish to warn you though,
I have one simple belief.
    1) Its my undying opinion that all
      people can do lots of damage to
      everything, armed with the faith
      that what they are doing is for
      the greater good.

 At first I didn't want this job. But in the end Prime bribed me, drugged me,
and finally convinced me using the help of some girls, a goat, and a vat of
vanilla pudding.
 If you want to send me questions, drugs, marriage proposals, bomb threats
or small furry animals by the name of Fred . Please send them to address
located at front of this file. Please include your name (or reasonable
facsimile) with any question or opinion so I will know who to insult, praise,
or forbid my children from marrying
  "Paradise is exactly like
   where you are right now,
   only much better."

 ONCE AGAIN MY SPACE IS GIVEN AWAY
 TO THE HAPPY HACKER(412)

     Ever call a commercial chat line and hear a rather large number of male
rather outgoing female on the line and why she was sooo friendly?
     The reason is simple.  Usually in these situations the one outgoing,
slightly seductive female voice you hear belongs to a woman who is paid to
monitor these chat lines, but is also required to double as an actress, to
pretend to be a regular caller on the line, and to coax male callers, through
any methods needed, to stay on the line longer.
    Here, I give you an ATI first. Here I will publish exerpts from an employ-
ees' manual which is distributed to female employees of a chat line company
which operates chat lines all over the US, and abroad.  Read on..

         CHARACHTER PROFILE

ALWAYS choose your opening charachter before opening your key!

Your voice tone and charachter should match.  Don't change names without
changing your voice.If you're working with another monitor, you should listen
for key phrases.  Your charachter profile should be AUTHENTIC.  You should
remember EVERYTHING about your charachter profile.  This includes voice tone,
charachter's description and anything else you may have said about your
charachter to a caller.  We recommend that you keep a notebook of charachters
you play.

   Examples of opening phrases:
1. Hi! My name is Peter Rabbit.         2. What's Happening!
3. Anybody out there? I'm sooooo lonely
4. Hey, Hey, Hey!
5. Help! Help!
6. Yo Baby, Yo Baby, Yo!
7. Hey, What's hoppin'?
8. I'm looking for a new love..
9. Yo! Anybody there?
10. Good Morning!
11. What's it to ya..
12. Helloooooooo..
13. I'm going to sing if you don't talk
to me (then sing if they don't)
14. Hey this is (Your charachter name),
Im looking for (Anybody), what am I
going to do??

    INTERACTING WITH ANOTHER MONITOR

This technique takes concentration. You must key in on certain phrases and
build either toward it, around it, or take it somewhere else.If you change
directions altogether, you must be aggressive.

        Interacting examples:

If you're talking on the line with three men and another monitor enters and
says, "Help, help!", if the callers don't respond, you would say:  "What's
that?  Wait, did you hear that?"

Monitor #1: What's wrong?
Monitor #2: My husband tied me to the bed!
Monitor #1: What! Is he a maniac?
Monitor #2: Yes! I am afraid he is going to kill me!
Monitor #1: Wait a minute, lady. How did you dial here?
Monitor #2: (Crying and sobbing loudly) I dialed with my nose!


WHEN TO TALK EXPLICITLY AND WHEN NOT TO

  Talking seductively requires a certain amount of finesse.  You can talk this
way without ever having to say anything sexual.  There are different technique
that you can use.  We do not want to come across as telephone whores!
  There are some key phrases that will let you know when and if the client
wants to talk explicitly.

       Seductive Examples:
1. What are you wearing?
2. Are you in bed?
3. Are you alone?
4. Do you like to talk dirty?
5. Do you like sex?
6. What do you do for fun?
7. Are you playing with yourself?
8. What do you like a woman/man to do for you in bed?

   These phrases will help you to know when to talk expilicitly about sex.  If
you start talking seductively and the caller hangs up, when he calls back,
change characters and DON'T talk seductively.  When you do realize that the
caller is seeking that type of conversation, select the appropriate technique.


 WHEN TO AND WHEN NOT TO DISCONNECT A
              CALLER

1. ALWAYS DISCONNECT CHILDREN OFF ALL ADULT LINES without being rude. However,
always mention they should call the TEEN line.
2. If a caller is talking sexually on the TEEN line, disconnect them AFTER
mentioning they should call an adult line.
3.  Do not disconnect callers because you do not like them.  You are being
paid to talk to the clients, not to have personal likes or dislikes for them.
4.  Sometimes hecklers are fun.  They brighten up the lines.  Use your
instincts and common sense, to decide whether it is appropriate at the time.

        Example: Heckler
A person tries to take down a phone number and someone is shouting or singing
while they are trying to do so, or someone is calling a name over and over,
disrupting all conversation.


           VOICE QUALITY

   Charachters should be full in every aspect. Practice your voices until they
are perfected.  Concentrate on your voice control, voice tone, pitch, and also
practice changing your pitch from high to low, and your voice tone from soft t
caorseness, if possible.
   For those who have difficulty changing voices, try to think of it as
singing, working with the scale: "Do,  Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do".
   Change your voice any way possible- High, Low, Soft, Loud, Coarse,
Trembling, Squeaky, with accents.....  etc.- ANY WAY YOU LIKE- Just be
different.

          TRAINING SUMMARY

   At the end of this training program, each monitor should be confident that
he/she could have any customer calling back as many times as possible.
   You've learned every technique available about how to control your calls to
the point that you know who's calling back and who isn't.  You want EVERYONE t
CALL BACK.
   Monitors who aren't able to get call backs will need to work harder at thei
conversation.  Remember, the final goal is to get call backs.  caller not
responding to your conversation quickly enough, get out of that charachter, an
try another.  You are selling a phone conversation, so your sales pitch is ver
important.


         ****END OF TRAINING MANUAL EXERPTS*****

     Neat, huh?  Many of the women you hear on these chat lines are simply
paidto keep men on the line. Paid to feign interest in the callers, paid to
coax male callers into staying on the line and calling back in the future.  An
yes, expected to talk very explicitly and even participate in phone sex and
"domination" routines with the male callers, if the callers request it.
     In our age of crass commercialism, it's not surprising to see yet another
form of human exchange, like the concept of a simple chat line, become
prostituted in this fashion.
     Ah, the frontiers of free enterprise...
