An 800 number will cost you a little
bit for each call in to your place.
Isn't it interesting now that Pat
Robertson has run outa campaign money,
there is no toll free number to contact
the 700 club? Maybe the timing is just
perfect, but ATI suggests he used up
all the 700 club money to try and
become president of the United States.

Boy, people dont like Captain Zap too
much, eh?

  The Chinese Government forces their
people to have abortions.
  The family of Li Quan Bong came to
the US so that he could get his PhD in
engineering. When he finished his PhD
in March of 1986 he filed an
application with the Chinese government
to stay in the US to continue 18 months
additional training. Then in May 1987,
his wife, Ping Hong became pregnant.
The Chinese government heard that she
was pregnant with a second child and
ordered them back to china so that she
could have an abortion. The Li's stayed
in the US and the chinese government
started harassing them. The chinese
Party has a set of rules regarding:
IUD insertion after one child,
sterilization after 2, and abortions
for women pregnant without official
permission.
  The US is trying to make the Li's go
back to China saying they cannot "prove
a well founded fear of persecution
upon return" to China. The attorney
general has final authority in such
cases. You can make your opinion known
by writing to:  Attorney General, Dept
of Justice, Constitution Ave. and 10th
St., N.W.  Washington, DC. 20530.

  Who ever heard of 85 cents for a cup
of coffee. International House of
Pancakes charges that and we here at
ATI think that's outragious. The other
day we took a ration of shit from a
waitress at IHOP for trying to pick a
seat away from the "Ct State Police".
We got tired of taking shit from the
waitress and walked out. The waitress
the parking lot and make us pay for
the coffee which he didn't drink. We
didnt drink it so we didnt feel we
should have to pay for it. The state
cop told us that weather or
not we drank it we had to pay for it
and that he didnt ever want to see us
in IHOP again.
  We just said screw it, and went over
to the Mariner, (the only other place
to get coffee at 4 in the morning).
  On Friday, the 29th, we plan to get
a big coffee maker and set up next to
IHOP offering free coffee to the
public. So if you think .85 is too
much to pay for a cup of coffee, come
and have a cup of coffee on ATI. We'll
be there from about 10pm-2am.

BEFORE CONGRESS changed the law, the
US government barred foreign authors,
academicians, journalists, artists,
and politicians from the United States
if they were deemed to be:
! members of the communist party
! critics of US foreign policy
! politically suspicious
! otherwise ideologically suspect.

  During 1988 the government cannot
prohibit foreigners from visiting or
residing in the US because of "any
past, present, or expected beliefs,
statements or associations."
  If you are an American citizen who
has invited or intends to invite a
foreigner to the US who might be
affected by this change, please let us
know.
  We are monitoring the State
Department's compliance to ensure that
the new law is being properly
interpreted and enforced. We may also
be able to assist you in obtaining a
visa for your guest.

Eccentric fun at highrises. Record a
scream into a boom box and play it back
dropping it off the top of a
skyscraper. Do this around 8pm when
everyone's gathered around the
television. Families will hear,
"ahhhhhhhhhh" as some monstrosity falls
freely past their window down to the
street.
