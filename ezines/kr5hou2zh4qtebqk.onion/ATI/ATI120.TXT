Dear Sirs,

Do you ever get replies to your bulk emailing that could be considered
emotionally damaging? If so I have written a program that filters out
phrases such as "Spam Spewing Simpletons" or "Leave me alone you Bastards"
from incoming emails, leaving you undisturbed with the untold countless
millions that await you in your new found effort to get rich without ever
really producing a product or indeed a service that is worth anything.

I have even made the filter's sensitivity level adjustable so that you can
set the automatic deletion function to activate at the familiar phrase
"Fuck You" at minimum to "I didn't request any of this information", or
"Unsubscribe" at maximum.

Obviously you are not someone who is interested in such intangibles as
demographics or anything as complicated as market research. You believe
that everyone should be interested in your new found way of buying houses
using only used popsicle sticks and husks of Spanish onions or how to get
totally nude pictures of Ernest Borgnine engaged on "hot" action with
national landmarks for free. I applaud you for your deep understanding of
human nature that everyone wants to know these things and will send you
$19.95 to reward you for your philanthropic endeavors. And there is no
reason why you should have to put up with the few ingrates that wish to
vocalize their misguided frustration by sending negatively charged email to
you , directly interfering with your ability to enjoy making the untold
millions that await you.

My simple program SCUMRID costs a mere $35.00, takes up a mere 50k of disk
space, and takes seconds to install and works FAST. Some even say its over
efficient, increasing system performance in areas they didn't expect. Many
companies insist that after using my program they found they had increased
the amount of free hard drive space to a level they had enjoyed before they
installed their bulk emailing program and in some case their ENTIRE
OPERATING SYSTEM!!!

Please send all enquiries to Cygnus@downcity.net

This one just in from Aaron K. (No relation to the Mad Yippie Pie Guy)
written dec 13 1997, sat, week of exams (don't ask)

"I saw God in the streets"
She was carrying a banner saying "Free Mumia Abu-Jamal"
With one hand
and the other passing out leaflets to passersby
Smiling.  
Even at the car drivers who rolled down their windows, gave her the 
finger or hurtfully intoned, "let him burn!".  
Smiling with a tinge of sorrow.
I heard her chanting
Still chanting, after all these years
not needing no bullhorn to be heard
an old but good one
making it sound unique with each piercing syllable, 
shattering the silence of the day
"No Justice, No Peace!"
with her gravely voice that had led one, 
"that say cut back we say fight back!" 
too many
and a tongue (and lungs) who had tasted more than Indiana's 
(though far less than California's) 
share of pepper spray, courtesy of the federal police state

She was beautiful
It was beautiful
every single one of us were beautiful with our flowing long hair, 
our glowing eyes and a determined and hopeful smile on our lips
Even the straight-laced sectarians, sparts, with their newspapers 
looked all right!!
Imagine the whole street filled with gods!
People were crying, screaming, smiling, hugging, yelling, loving, eating, 
talking, screaming, and even listening.
A gigantic communal organism overflowing the city and overflowing each 
others' minds.
evolving

We didn't have palm branches but the leaves off the city sidewalk 
trees softened our jubilated march
as that day we brought peace, with a tinge of 
justice downtown and made the 
glass towers of babylon echo (ECHO EcHo echo...) our cries, 
if only for a fleeting moment
We even drowned out the elevator sub-carrier 
christmas music much to many a low-
paid retailer clerk's relief
Shoppers stalled in the streets overburdened by packaging 
worrying about last minute material gifts to fill empty 
relationships, worrying about the traffic 
jam we were creating... and (we were) enjoying!
A couple of them looked to us, listened, 
and you could almost reach out and 
touch it.  For it was there.
A star sparkled overhead, one alone bright enough to be seen 
over city lights, 
leading us on.

I looked back to the head of the march, to catch the look on her face.
But God was gone.
Through the corner of my eye I made out the back of her head as she 
went limp and some men grabbed her, crushing her walkie talkie 
underfoot while dragging her away.
ack, the pain!
a cry sounded as she something caught on her eyebrow ring
her girl friend and a couple people with 
armbands and orange jackets swarmed 
round trying to do something.
do something!  we should.
but
they all kind of 
just 
faded away
a van sped off
and we walked on.

and we walked slow
maybe it was the wind picking up?
maybe the last twenty minutes of walking on fresh snow had 
reached peoples' feet and minds had 
once again turned to the 
things we too often do and 
know we must 
do?

"free mumia abu-jamal, abolish the racist death penalty" 
wasn't ringing like it should and normally did
maybe it was people buttoning up their jackets and 
closing themselves on the inside?
shoppers were once more ignorant, trying to buy before 
closing time, and balking 
at any attempts to give them flyers with grimaces 
worthy of a white Scrooge
a couple people started chanting, "off the pig!"
but nothing was 'on'
and so we said our parting good-byes and left, 
knowing that we wouldn't be 
seeing each other on tv or in the newspapers

knowing that God was as God is, in jail, again
racking up another charge on her sinless but criminal record
"assaulting an officer with a chant" --what a charge!
outstanding from a month ago at that, and only now enforced!
maybe she'll teach them about hypocrisy for their present?

knowing that she'll be released, 
and I'll find her again, and again, in the 
streets
knowing that we're going to need her and others,
many more others

praying
for shes and hes, young and vibrant
born into a new world
in the month following Christmas
with hearts burning, eyes glowing, and fists pumping in the sky!
dreaming and building an upside down kin-dom yet to come

perhaps
perhaps it'll be so
perhaps even here of all places?


on behalf of God, Abbie "stop the '_______!'" Hoffman, 
all the people (maybe some I knew?) who got 
pepper sprayed last month at the APEC summit in Vancouver 
at the University of British Columbia a 15 minute cycle from my home, 
a not-yet-started ND student activist group comin' in january, 
the 3000 people spending christmas on death row, 
and those who would overthrow a state that does such a 
cruel thing:


HAVE A _________ and __________ CHRISTMAS!



ps: was this better than a card, or what?
a) yes  b) no  c) yes, but___________   d) no, but ______________ 
e) I like answering 'e' even if i always get marked wrong

pps: title borrowed from David Romano's essay: 
"I saw America in the Streets" in High School Revolutionaries

ppps: needs editing, yes, but not as much as my take homes.
      (ed note: hehehe. Yeah. I would capitalize all the beginnings
      next. Then tighten up some of the ideas into shorter phrases,
      but herein lies a really good beginning.Let's call it finished
      for now, I'm in a hurry for people to view it.)




     ***   ***   ***   ***
CALENDULA!
Never give up on what you really want to do.

powerful than one with all the facts.

Fry Bread copyleft, 1997 Marco Capelli

(Ch)Fry bread, frybread, make me some frybread
    How can you be my Nana if you won't make me frybread.
    Frybread, frybread, make me some frybread,
    How can you be a Nana if you won't make some frybread.

Make me some frybread, chop up some peppers,
Make up some frybread- add some beans and cheese
How 'bout some frybread 'n lettuce n' tomatoes
Make it any kind of bread but make some fry bread please.

(ch)

I'll herd the sheep for you I'll chop the wood.
I'll mud the roof if you'll only make frybread
I'll sweep the floor auntie, I promise I'll be good.
I'll learn a song for you but please make some fry bread.

(ch)

Wheat flour or white flour
Use any kind of flour
Heck even Jewish rye flour
But make some frybread please.

(chorus, repeat and fade...)
This song dedicated to all of Bob and Bonnie's children.
Shouts to my Nana, my Bubbe, Ana Egge and Mrs. Laurie, my 5th grade
English teacher at Groton Heights.


next up we have a cover.
Telephone Me Baby by George M. Cohan. 1898. From the Musical 
"The Behman Show"

G             E7   A7
Telephone be baby, tell me all you know;

Telephone me, baby, if you kneed the dough.
           Dm      E7
You know I love to talk to you, honey,
    Am
You-wanna-talk-fast-cause-it-costs-a-lotta-money but,
D7                        G
Telephone me, baby, every day.

You sent me some email with the title:
"Never Use 10 and 20 dollar bills again"

Hi. This is not necessarily anything personal, against you. I've set my
e-mail filter to block almost all e-mail coming in, aside from that
sent from a few relatives, associates at business and school, and close
friends. 

Perhaps you're a pleasant, reasonable individual. You probably are. But
aside from the blizzard of spam out there, there are some extremely rude,
socially challenged individuals online, who think it's cool to drop
unwarranted abuse on people they'll never have to face in person. As a
personal choice, I've decided to never make it easy for these people to
darken my day with their presence again. Let's see how "brave" they are,
when they have to do their trolling in public, where everyone can see.

My apologies for any inconvenience that this might cause. If it's not a
private matter, perhaps you could post online, instead ?

Thanks,

Joseph B. Dunphy, aka "stats

Hola:

Antes que nada te pido disculpas por enviarte este mensaje, tu direccion de
email la tome de un libro de visitas de la red, espero que no te moleste.

Mi nombre es Juan Puente y vivo en la Ciudad de San Juan del Rio, Queretaro
en Mexico y mi historia es la siguiente; soy un loco enamorado de mi novia
con la cual me casare el 25 de Abril de este año y quiero hacer la
loquera de que sea de las bodas mas felicitadas por todo el mundo, para lo
cual solicito de tu valiosisima ayuda.

Lo unico que deseo pedirte es que me envies por correo postal aunque sea 
en un pequeño pedazo de papel o si quieres en una postal una felicitacion
por nuestra boda, si gustas que tan solo diga Felicidades! y todas las 
cartas que me lleguen se las entregare en una fiesta sorpresa el dia de su
cumpleaños que es una semana antes de nuestra boda y conociendola, este 
detalle la hara llorar de emocion y alegria.

Tal vez pienses que es muy pronto, pero faltan menos de 70 dias y lo que
quiero es que se distribuya por todo el mundo mi mensaje.   No quiero romper
ningun record, simplemente quiero halagarla.

Ademas, observa todo lo que acontece a partir del dia de su cumplea¤os

PAWN Prime Anarchist World News 2nite. 
Wallingford, Konetiuk. March 10. 
Connecticut Lottery Commission now has a great opportunity to
downsize and Postal Workers all over the US can breath a sigh.
No more going "postal" the word of the day is LOTTO.

"Too bad they don't offer stock," said Anne Arquette of Soneco Pit
development; Fairfield, Konetiuk, a night manager of the local 7-11.
"Gimme a grand or so, lemme watch it vest in 2 or 3 years!!"

Let's do some math around this killing of lottery employees last week in
the second largest gambling state in the union.

If they hire 5 (five) people to replace them all at 5/hour with no 
benefits that will cost the state 52,000 bucks a year instead of the
382,746 total these people were taking before bennies and incentives. 
That saves more than 330,746 to attrition. (would dying before retirement
be attrition or an act of God or what? Well we'll call it attrition.)

A couple more volunteers to "go lotto" we can save a million a year.
Konetiuk could really flourish after that. Maybe we should all invest in
Bridge-port after all. It's likely to make 'ya more than El Nino, eh?





So there I was playing Yatzee with 3 rastafari eating Manischewitz
savory garlic matzos dipped in hummus.





Nemesis - (for fred friendly) a source of harm or ruin; retributive
justice in its execution or outcome; an opponent that cannot be beaten
or overcome.
   "That degenerate demagogue Joseph McCarthy met his nemesis when 
Edward R Murrow met Milo Radulovich."
   from the Disheveled Dictionary by Karen Elizabeth Gordon.
   1997. Houghton Exxon Mifflin Co. 
   ASBN (auschwitz secured basic #) 0-395-68990-2



Y'ever notice???
Every time we change policies somewhere in the world- ie: bombing,
blockading, ignoring, destabilizing, etc.- all the convenience
stores change gas company signs? BP ->  Exxon ->  Mobil ->
Shell -> Phillips 66 ->   76   
Like musical chairs.
