                   Jungle Survival
                   ---------------
            By: Digital Destruction (604)

         Hello once again, ATI freaks, it's me   again with some more
         hints to get you   through those pesky situations which
         always manage to mess up your dinner     reservations...This
         time, Jungle War   Tactics.
           Has there ever been a time when you   were taking a
         leisurely walk through the Amazon jungle only to realize by
         way of a note pinned to a tree by a spear that you were being
         stalked by headhunters? At that moment I'll bet most of you












         said to yourselves 'Gee, I wish I knew some Jungle war
         tactics!'..Well Here's the    break youve been looking for.

         Knife trick:
         ------------

         To kill your enemy by way of excruciatin pain, use this
         method. Sharpen many    hardwood sticks, and plant point-up
         in  a patch of land -on a trail, for        instance- and
         cover in fesces. Then     cover it all with leaves or
         something   and when Bongo and Umgala come after    you, they
         will step on the sticks, get  driven into their feet (And if
         they fell their bodies), and if that dont kill em then blood
         poisoning from the feces    will.

         Pond Trick
         ----------
         If you can find a very still pond, you  can plant the sharp
         sticks in this, but you dont have to, and then cover with
         grass, leaves etc. They will think it is land and SPLOOSH.

         Well, those two tricks should do it.    (I cant think of any
         more!) So
         until next time, Hasta!




                 'Good Time' Tear Gas
                 --------------------
                 By: Digital Destruction (604)

         Okay everyone, it's time to cook!
         It seems to me, that an insurance       seminar just wouldnt
         be any fun without some good potent tear gas. Am I right?
         Well anyway, As I was walking through  my local K-Mart I was
         approached by     the King, Elvis himself who instructed  me
         by divine intervention to write this file so here goes.

         To make real potent tear gas, it's      relatively simple.

         Ingredients:
         ------------
         2 lbs. of red pepper seeds
         A handy-dandy Popeil Percolater
         A perfume bottle or Binaca Blaster

         Procedure:
         ----------
         Place seeds, 1/2 pound at a time and    perk (perk?) for an
         hour or two. Scoop  the seeds out and you will have about 2
         tablespoons of the most potent resin    I've seen. Put this
         with a little
         Tabasco in a squirter and there ya go.  The seeds can also be












         reused for fun... The next time you go see 'Camille' in the
         movies, toss a few off the balcony!   Hee Hee....Anyway, this
         is Digital
         Destruction telling you, when the earth collides with the
         sun, try to stay out  of the backblast.


              The Calcium Carbide Grenade
              ---------------------------
             By:  Digital Destruction(604)

         Ya know, one of the things I like       about this country is
         that anyone can   build their very own anti-personell
         grenade using store bought everyday     materials. In this
         file I will discuss  how to build one of these babies.
         It should be known that when this       grenade is exploded
         it produces a cloud of thick grey smoke 40 feet in diameter
         hovering 3 feet above the ground in    which nobody can see
         or breathe with    just a hint of shrapnel to top off the
         event, so I wouldnt go throwing it at   your local boy scout
         parade for a       'good laugh'...Procede with caution...
         There are still a lot of angry Indians  left over from
         Bhopal.

         Ingredients needed:
         -------------------
         250 grams of Calcium Carbide
         (You can buy this stuff in any hardware store as lantern
         fuel)

         1 Coca-Cola can (Washed and dried)

         1 100ml test tube (pyrex)

         1 rubber cork

         Duct tape

         Procedure:
         ----------

         Funnel 180-250g of Cal. Carbide into the can so it is about
         1/4 full. Then,     remembering to keep it AWAY from water,
         put aside. Fill test tube to 100ml and   cork. MAKE SURE the
         outside of this is COMPLETELY dry. Any excess water on the
         cork or outside of the tube will make   YOU an instant
         victim! Then, carefully  insert test tube into hole in top of
         can so it rests on bed of C.C.. Drop dots  of wax around
         opening to hermetically   seal opening, and wrap the whole
         thing  in duct tape. When thrown, upon impact, the test tube
         will break, scattering    water all over the C.C. creating a
         gaseous reaction resulting in 600lbs    per square inch of
         pressure which will  last about 5 seconds. the can will
         explode, shrapnel will fly and the gas  will go. Here is a












         picture of how it    should look.

                  !CALCIUMCCCC!
                  !CARBIDECCCC!
                  -------------
         Remember. Carbide gas is a cancer
         causing toxin and is fatal.

         Now you have your own anti-personell
         grenade! Won't Mom be surprised!
         Have fun.....And be careful.
         Until next time, VIVA REVOLUTION!



                  Mall Terrorism
                  --------------

           ..Phun things to do in the vast
              malls of Suburbia, by The Happy
               Hacker and Digital Destruction


         1. Get 500 mg gelatin capsules and
         fill about 100 of them with high-
         potency suds.  Also fill about 30
         capsules with red Jello mix. Dump
         all the capsules into the large
         fountain that is the central part
         of many malls.  The time necessary
         for the capsules to dissolve and wreak
         their havoc will be sufficient for
         you to make a non-hasty exit from the
         area.

         2. Take a penny, and wrap a (1/4")
         strip of litmus paper.  Wrap that in
         a foil gum wrapper, making sure the
         penny, litmus paper and the foil all
         touch each at some point. You now
         a crude version of an electronic theft
         device!  Place it in a plant next to












         the security "towers" at the exit of
         the store. The alarm will keep going
         off, and no one will be able to figure
         out what's setting it off!!

         3. Phun with Mannequins! Try these!
          a. Put Groucho Marx glasses on them.
          b. Switch wigs on male and female
             mannequins.
          c. Make them hold signs with
             revolutionary quotes on them.
          d. Stand next to mannequins and stay
             still.  Pretend to be one!

         4. If you are male, go to the women's
         makeup counter and demand service.

         5. Put comdoms over security cameras,
         of course avoiding being seen by
         them before/while doing so.

         7. Computers! Write a short BASIC
         program that spews obscenitites or
         other annoying propaganda across the
         screen of a display computer in a
         store. Here's an example of one for a   Commodore 64:

          10 PRINT"(CLR HOME)"
          20 POKE 53281,0:POKE 53280,0
         21 INPUT"PRESS ANY KEY FOR DEMO!":A$
          22 IF A$="" THEN 22
          23 PRINT"(CLR HOME)":PRINT:PRINT:PRINT: PRINT
         24 PRINT"(CNTRL-2)THERE ONCE WAS A GIRL FROM VERMEETH"
          25 PRINT"THAT LIKED TO CIRCUMCIZE GUYS
          WITH HER TEETH"
          26 PRINT"NOT FOR THE MONEY"
          27 PRINT"AND NOT FOR THE GLORY"
          28 PRINT"BUT JUST FOR THE CHEESE
          UNDERNEATH!!"

         NOTE:Where the prg says "(CLR HOME)",
         you will actually type SHIFT and the
         CLR HOME key. A symbol of a heart
         encased in a box should be displayed.
          Where the prg says "(CNTRL-2)", you
         hold down the CNTRL and the 2 key.

         Run the program, and watch the
         unsuspecting comsumer become apalled
         at the off-color limerick!

         8. Phun in the parking lot!
          a. Redirect traffic with orange
          traffic cones.












          b. (You need a few people for this
          one) Go past all the newer model
          cars, giving each a healthy shove
          while passing. This should result
          in an infinite number of car alarms
          going off at once!

         9. Pranks in the Electronics Dept!
          a. Put porno flick in display VCR.
          b. Put tape of Richard Pryor or
          some other very offensive commedian
          in a cassette deck.

         10. Mix smut books in with other
         books being sold at the bookstore.
         Also, if they have a display window,
         replace one of the displayed books
         with the most bizarre smut book you
         can find.

         11. Pay F0ne Phun!
          a. See a crowd of annoying mall rats
          congregating around a pay phone
          waiting for one of their buddies to
          call them and tell them their
          parents have gone out and it's ok to
          have the troop of degenerates over
          for a Megadeath listening party? No
          problem! Go to the pay phone across
          the hallway and watch them curse
          angrily with screams of "What da
          fuck?!?" as you direct an SSCU to
          constantly call that number and say
          "Hello, Hello, Hello..."
          b. Pull underneath rubber covering
          by the handset of a pay fone and
          locate the red wire. Strip it, then
          cut it.  The pay phone will accept
          coins, but won't connect any call
          after someone has paid for it. Go
          back the next day and twist the
          spliced ends of the wire together.
          Voila! You have hit the jackpot, and
          should receive every coin that has
          been insereted into the phone since
          the red wire was cut.
          c. Put a rubber spider, or something
          equally disquieting in the coin
          return slot of a pay phone. Stay
          nearby and watch your surprised
          victim retrieve it!!

         12. Here are some standard names you
         can have paged in a depeartment store:












          a. Connie Linkus
          b. Dick Hurtz
          c. Mike Hunt
          d. Ben Dover
          e. Jack Meoff

         13. Take a powerful magnet, preferably
         a bar magnet, and hold it in your hand
         as inconspicuously as possible.  Walk
         over to a video game in progress in
         the mall-rat infested arcade and hold
         the magnet in back of the machine.
         The screen of the video game will be
         disrupted, to the suprise and dismay
         of the players and spectators, until
         you remove the magnet.


         That's all the terroristic pranks we
         can think of at the moment.  But be
         on the lookout for Mall Terrorism,
         Part 2 in the near future!

         Doc Telecom/Raider update: They are
         going for another Superior Court Review
         this week, where a "deal" will be
         offered to Doc and Raider by the
         prosecution.   With any luck, they
         will be offered 1 year's time, with
         the chance for parole in a short time.
         By the way, Doc and Raider were
         featured in an article about hackers
         that appeared 6 weeks ago on the front
         page of the New York Times.

         A hacker from New Jersey called The
         Wasp was busted in connection with the
         Livermore Labs breakin.  The feds paid
         him a nice friendly visit. More on this
         in future issues.

         Be kind to your children: The news
         tonight had a piece regarding Yuppie-
         type parents who push their children
         too hard.  One mother mentioned
         made her son participate in about 8
         after-school activities, which took up
         at least 2 hours of after-school time
         each day. The activities were curtailed
         only when the 9-year-old boy displayed
         strange physical symptoms such as
         headaches, and constant colds, which
         are typical symptoms for overworked
         children.  A psychologist descibes how
         parents who overwork their children
         feel: that their chldren are status
         sysmbols, and they should be pushed
         to "succeed" so that the parents can
         boast of their childrens' endeavors.

         AT&T, MCI, British Telecommunications
         LC, France Telecom and Western Union

         went operational last month, support-
         ing a capacity of 560M bit/sec.  Look
         forward to better international
         connections! ;)

         Smart Cards: How Smart?
         Smart cards are wallet-sized plastic
         cards with microprocessors built into
         them, and they are on the rise. They
         are widely used in France and Japan,












         and it is reported that Visa and
         MasterCard are making deals for
         millions of dollars worth of cards.
         Smart cards are so widely used in Japan
         that the country's Minister of Finance
         is investigating how their widespread
         use is affecting the nation's money
         supply.  Since the microprocessors
         built into the cards contain
         information on the cardholder, there
         is no need to access a network to
         verify transactions.  This makes the
         smart card useful in credit card and
         calling card applicaions.  However,
         they are beginning to be applied to
         other uses.  The National Security
         Agency recently signed contracts with
         three companies for devices that
         utilize smart cards to protect
         government computers against hackers.
         The devices, called low-cost encryp-
         tion/authentication devices (LEAD's)
         utilize a smart-card system in which
         the microprocessors on the cards
         contain a large amount of personal
         data on the user, logon sequences
         and security data which specifies
         the level of access the user has.
         The user would logon to the computer
         system by inserting the card into a
         reader attached to the terminal in use,
         then enters his password when the
         machine validates his card. Neat,
         huh? These measures are designed
         to screen out unauthorized users and
         encrypt data passed across the Defense
         Data Network (DDN).

         It seems that the jingoistic blood is
         starting to stir again.  Our gov't
         is openly threatening to bomb Libya..
         ..again!  Threatening to violate
         international law, and thumbing its
         nose on world opinion, our gov't
         prepares to once again commit a
         terroristic act in an attempt to
         stir up a faltering nationalism in
         our country.  But how many more innocent
         Libyans must pay for this if it is
         to be carried out?
