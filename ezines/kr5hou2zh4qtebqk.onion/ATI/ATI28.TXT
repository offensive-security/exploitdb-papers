HACKERS: One Man's Definition.
by The Demon
 
Hacking in itself is seldom defined
correctly; the definition I use is a
person who is very knowledgeable about
computers and is rather expert at
using them. In short, a really good
programmer/modifyer.  A hacker will
spend hours revising or editing a
program or application to make it more
efficient; his true love is learning
and he will spend most of his time
pursuing new things about computers.
Indeed, he may often work ridiculously
(seemingly) simply to discover how to
"build a better mouse trap".  These
people are not interested, usually in
getting into other people's software
and systems.  They are more interested
in figuring out how things work and
often improving or modifying them for
their own use.
  True hackers believe that
information and the use of computer
time should not be wasted; indeed,
they are hateful of passwords and file
 
Pro Thames River will be
presented to the general assembly at
the next regular session in January.

--July 21,
1885 A Rogue Elephant shot.  .Barnum's
large Asiatic elephant Albert, which
killed his keeper on Saturday at
Nashua NH, was taken to a wooded
ravine monday afternoon, chained to
four immense trees and otherwise
fastened. 33 Keene Light guards shot
and killed the elephant.
 
GROTON BANK Saturday was the warmest
day of the season. Mercury over 92.
Albert A Pollard received a contract

Parkin's grove of the Naval Base.
While vegetation of most
descriptions is failing for want of
rain; corn looks thrifty and is growing
fast. Rain is much needed. Brooks and
cisterns are low.
 
Kingston, NY. Fones are Fucked Totally
fucked. First off they need 50 cents to
complete a 950 call; and only to tell
you your call cannot be completed.
  So I grab a fistful of dimes and
quarters; to dial direct for a change
of pace; the thing wants a lot of
money. I put it all in but it keeps on
rejecting this purrfectly phine looking
specimin of a quarter. So i get another
quarter and put it in. It spits back
the whole kittenkabootle.
  So I try the call again, it tells me
I have a minute and starts ringing.  My
YIP friendz answer and we start
talking. After a couple minutes the
thing suddenly shuts me off and I can
hear them; they can't hear me.
  Click.
  It spits the whole
kitchenkubbnoodles back to me again.
  I compleat the call again.
  We talk politely, all of a sudden
the thing starts bitchin cause she
wants 20 more centagos. We talk. I
usually ignore threats like that.
  She asks again.
  Again she asks. Then all of a sudden
she thanks me.
  I love fucked fones.
 
Well, that's it for ATI28. hope you
liked it, and all that jazz.
