Infomaniack bbs had a new sysop for
about 6 days. Her name is Pinky.
She'll check in now and then, but it'll
mostly be remote these days, as she's
hiding somewhere near navy housing for
a few months.
This issue comes about without its
contributing editors. I'll be the only
one writing for this. This may suck,
or it may come out good, but I'm on
a "roll", and I decided to put this one
out in 4 hours. So pick it up tomorrow
around 6am!!!

No. your duplex isnt screwing up.
That was to get your attention. A
chemist down at the local germ warfare
distributor just warned me about a
book he saw around my coffee table the
other day.

ANARCHIST COOKBOOK!!! Do not use it
for more than reading material,
inspiration, and fun without first
consulting with a physicist, chemist,
your local science teacher, or
some other form of drugz expert.
The chemical eqations are simply
infested with minor miscalculations
that just might be lethal. I dont have
the book near me right now (using the
laptop to publish this moment)
otherwise I'd cite an example, but
picture yourself following instructions
verbatim, and having to answer to why
you are missing your entire right arm,
and why there's a wick sticking out of
your elbow.
  At any rate, if you use Anarchist
Cookbook, keep in mind that this
happened; whether purposely, or by
mistake.
  IE: play carefully; but do play.

       How to get a FREE meal at a
       nice restaurant:
           Impersonate a contest winner
       Call them up and tell them their
       brunch has been moved back a day
       due to high traffic this week.
       Then show up as them and prepare
       to feast. Big 4stars rarely ever
       ask for proof that you are who
       you are.

made his deadline. (Gee, I hope
Minuteman shows up. He's got about 2
hours left on his deadline, and he
doesnt even know it. hehehe)He has a
poem
for us. Right now, we're gonna
verify some of these #'s for ya.

A word on "550" chatlines. My
e-girlfriend worked a couple weeks at
one of the 550 chatlines. Her job was
to connect to the system and pretend
she was a female paying for the call.
  She was also told she had to perform
phone sex if asked by a paying
customer. Although she enjoyed learning
a lot about fone stuff, she couldnt
handle sucking face over the phone.
  Feel used? Some (most) of these girls
are being payed to act like your
newphound phrend. Makes you think about
the 603 bridge and Heidi, Dawn, Fawn,
Cheri, and Shauna, eh?

Pat Robertson told Dan Rather he will
definitely run for '92.
  700 CLUB has made its budget quite
lean lately now that he lost the race
for '88. A call to their prayer line
used to be 1800-456-0700. You'll now
have to dial 1-ac-#. Bummer huh? You
gotta pay. He ran out of money.
  Makes ya wonder what kind of money
the guy has used and/or intends to use.
God's money? His money? Your money?

New London, Ct. participates in
National Ski Patrol. Can you believe
that??? What a scream. There's NFW (No
....ing Way) to ski New London. There's
nothing here. Can you believe spending
money for something that'll never be
used??? You can tune them in at
155.340 on your scanner when in
southeastern connecticut. What a trip,
eh? Well, then again, with the US
Government, that comes as no major
surprise, eh?

  Stingray from Jersey gives us this
one: He was minding his own business
working as night shift front desk
clerk at the local hotel when a guy
calls him.
  "Hello, this is ... ... with abc
Credit card company, and we're checking
for fraudulent cardz. Could you read
me back the last few cc #'s in your
series???"
  Stingray says this seems to work best
on immigrant type people. He speaks
hardly any english and felt that may
have set him off and made him
ready to believe anyone.

RE: General Dynamics.

  If companies throughout the US are
pulling off this Blitz Krieg the lump
sum in leu of cost-of-living increases; They're basically showing that
rather than moving away
from the need for strong unions, we
are beginning to need them much again.
  We made a move away from union
necessity in the late 50's and 60's
when the powers-that-be started
behaving. Just when unions start feelin
it's ok to disband soon; Reagan goes
and brings us back to the 1920's where
we needed watchdogs like the teamsters,
AFL-CIO, MDA, MTC, boilermakers, etc.

JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T GET BUSH DONT
MEAN I GOTTA GO SCREWING BIRDS.
        or
    Quayle, Quayle. Why you buggin.

  Why is the press going after every
picqune little thing they can get on
Big Yupster, Dan Quayle?
I mean, if he was screwing sheep
or AIDS infested Englishmen, that's one
thing, but a 17 month mistake on his
resume? Serving his country's mainland
rather than forcing our beliefs on
other countries? Being almost as rich
as Bentsen? Gimme a break. Find
something substantial, guys; or shut
the phuch up.
  It's time we faced the facts, guys.
  The press is going after Quayle
because they cannot get direct proof
on Bush's activities with the CIA,
Manuel Noriega, and the drug dealers
of NYC, Massachussetts, etc. They can
only enter in court that he was FRIENDS
with Noriega? Baloney.
  Bush phunded Noriega's Cocaine Cartel
for months, years, and we're gonna vote
him in so he can phund it for
decades!!!

   KIDS GAMES      S.K.  (c)1988
   ----------
The world it spins
and grass is green

The birds fly
and children cry

Here come the clouds
Dark they block the day

Rain falls
Mud is everywhere
Children seem not to notice
that the end is near

"Mommy, why are you crying?"
"Daddy, why must we leave?"
And the baby smiles

"Attention, attention. This is an
emergency broadcast"
"Daddy, can we play a game?"
"Take cover, prepare for nuclear war"
"Mommy, is it dinner time yet?"
And the baby laughs

"30 minutes til impact" (midnite)
"mommy.... mommy... mommy?"
"Daddy? Where's mommy?"
And the baby learns the truth
Pain, fear, nothingness.

And a child writes

Dear Peace
Where did you fall?
The world is in termile
Cant you hear us?
We scream our hearts out

Dear War
Can  you go away?
Peace wont see the light
When war, it wants to fight

These are the letters
Sent out in vain
war took over long ago
when peace took the train

Dear Freedom
What do you need?
Is it a helping hand?
Or do you want Peace?

Dear Leaders
Listen to our cries
When we wanna be directed
You fill our eyes with lies.

Dear Love
Why forsake the people
do our hearts have to lament?
Memories we soon forget

Dear Loneliness
It's all give and take
the more we try for happiness
the more loneliness we make

Dear Dreams
see the light of day
no matter how long we cry
the nightmares wont go away

To whom it may concern
out there
the heart and soul still bleed
give away for nothing
and the world, it shows its greed

FEMA COULD BE  E.B.!!!
In one of the issues, we told you that
FEMA mission cant be carried out at
Electric Boat division of Gen Dynamics
???
Well, guess what? They just got
approved to build a house sized
incinerator to burn classified docs.
Hmmm. Guess what those incinerators
resemble greatly? Can you spell stove?

Sorry to make any Jewish people

I'm not saying I like Morton a lot,
But here's a few quotes from the
guy that show a true thinker is there:

* There is no way to seperate the
poverty issue from the race issue.
* We've got to free black people and
other minorities, and the way to do
that is to give them a truly equal
opportunity to compete.

  /by the way, August is the  /
 /anniversary of Anne Frank's/
/arrest. Something to think /
about...                   /

* I am sick and tired of the liberals
proclaiming that they are the only
people in the country concerned about
civil rights.
* When today's liberal says blacks
cannot take care of themselves, he
is exhibiting his hidden racism.
* people cannot take care of
themselves?
* Baloney!
* It is up to us to give them an
equal opportunity to take care of
themselves, then step aside to let
them do it.

    /by the way. Mort, Mort, Mort is /
   /right now, staying a week at the/
  /appollo theater in Harlem. He   /
 /promised he'll have an answer by/
/the end of the week. I doubt  he/
will have quite that, but he's  /
certainly doing what he does   /
best: getting people talking. /

  Abbie Hoffman says get October's
issue of Playboy magazine if you
wanna know the real truth about
George Bush... The man who might be
president.
  The way Abbie's talking, this might
be the nail that tucks the guy in.
Then again, if no one cares to read it,
things might go on biz-as-usual. But
read it. I think old wimpus George is
gonna have a LOT to answer to.
  And if I know Abbie, we mean a LOT!!!
