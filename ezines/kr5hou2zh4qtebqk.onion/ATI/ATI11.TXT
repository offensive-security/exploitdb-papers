. Buy a paper from an honorbox and put
all the others on top or next to the
box with a rock on em.
. Move the yellow "police line do not
cross" ribbons to cordone off streets
or busy walkways.
. Swap the streetsigns.
. Move for sale signs to other houses.
. Grocery stores have cards where you
can put up free ads. Advertise
something outrageously cool like a $30
snowblower for someone.
. Use a truck to steal all the garbage
cans and put them all in storage
somewhere. Then put an ad in the
paper: garbage cans for sale: real
cheep.
. Take orange construction cones and
make detours. The one that works best
for us was this: block off 4 4way
intersections so they all have to
detour to the right, and go in a
complete circle. When the circle fills
up traffic will be at a standstill til
a policeman can show up and figure
things out.
. Put signs on convenience store doors
"Back in 5 minutes".
. Get out a plumbing wrench and open
all the fire hydrants.
. Advertise garage sales for people.
. Find out a professor's name at a
local community college and call in
sick for him pretending you're his
wife or roomate.
. Call Mary Kay cosmetics, or Avon, or
a hearing clinic as someone and
arrange a free makeover/eartest in
"your" home.

HEY EDITORS:
  Could you tell the guys at Playboy
that I think Peter Moore's compilation
of
the Reagan Years, the Jelly-Bean
Presidency was phenomnal. Just when we
were
wondering how to sum up eight years of
"bumbling ineptitude", Moore puts it
all
together in a few pages.

YO, WORD:
  I'll tell you were George was:
  October, 1980: Iran/France. 
Solidifying a deal with Khomeini that
was far
more enticing than Carter could
morally justify.
  Why were we stupid enough to believe
that Reagan "will not negotiate with
terrorists" when he cut the largest
deal we will ever see, (and are still
seeing) before he was even mandated...
 I mean elected.
  Why were we stupid enough to believe
that Reagan was not going to raise
taxes? It's ovious he raised taxes. If
you didnt notice a tax increase; the
last 6 years, you are either too
filthy rich to care, or too dirt poor
to be
squeezed any drier.
  Now, I'm not cutting George for
doing exactly as he was told. I
certainly
would have if you paid me enough.
  I'm saying dont kick yourself 7
years from now for having believed a
garden-
path speech. Look at the truths. Dont
let go. No matter who gets in your
taxes
are going to HAVE to increase to fund
all this growth we are seeing.
  No matter how they gloss it over,
the democratic administraton is going
to
force military duty on your post-teen
children.
  And no matter how well Bush keeps
the ball rolling; this growth is only
putting off the inevitable: a mounting
world depression.
  This November, I will be voting on
local issues only. I plan to pull the
Mickey Mouse/Donald Duck lever on the
national front.
  I wont tolerate being lied to.
  Then again, I had it coming when I
asked for a clown-white, two step
dancin
fool to lead my nation.

A new patient was quite upset when the
doctors nurse led him to a curtained
cubicle and told him to undress.
  "But I only want my ingrown toenail
looked at," he protested.
  "Our rule is that everyone
undresses, the nurse answered.
  "Stupid rule," grumbled the patient,
"making me undress to look at just my
toe..."
  "That's nothing," came a voice from
the next cubicle over, "I just came in
here to install another telephone."

Watchin Night Flight. First time I've
seen that snce about 1985. Good stuff.
They're doin an expose about the
1960's and how it's about to repeat. 
I was
talkin to AH the other day, and he was
discussing that very phenomenon.
  "We're repeating the 60's with our
clothes, our music, our poetry, our
rallies. How come we can't start
repeating the political thought too? 
That's
why I'm bringing back Steal This Book,

well, I'll bring back Woodstock Nation
