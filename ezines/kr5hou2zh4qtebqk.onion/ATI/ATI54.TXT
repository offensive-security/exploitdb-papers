Hi! Welcome to ATI54.  Sorry we didn't get out an issue as of late, but we had
some difficulties because our home site was down for a while.

     Well, they went and did it. Got us into another war.  I was hoping that
it wouldn't happen, but it did. I think about the war often, as most Americans
seem to.  I wonder exactly why we were there. A lot of people who are against
the war think that it's all about oil and the lack of an energy policy. While
I think oil has a lot to do with it, I also think that others factors
contribute to the conflict. It may be that the US is fighting to maintain its
position of world power, and to combat Hussein's threat of uniting the Arab
world under his leadership.  If that's true, then I guess it's just another
case of a Frankenstein created by the US, such as Panama's Noriega, gone out
of control.  Our government has favored brutal dictators like Hussein and
Noriega, and say nothing about their atrocities as long as they serve the US
government's vital interests.  But what they have never learned is that there
comes a time when the Husseins and the Noriegas decide they want more power. 
Subsequently, these leaders become out of control.

     In any event, I'm glad it seems to be over. I hope now the other problems
of the Middle East will be addressed.

     Well, you may have guessed it. Happy Harry Hardon and The Happy Hacker
are the same person.  Just a change of name.

     NEWARK, NJ - It seems that the local yocals will break into a car for any
reason, including to grab one of those Bart Simpson dolls that stick to the
windows. Jeez.

     Movies? Go see The Godfather Part III (excellent movie - fantastic
score!!), "The Grifters", "Silence of the Lambs", and "Hidden Agenda".  Avoid
movies with lack of creativity and innovation, such as "Sleeping With The
Enemy", "If Looks Could Kill", and others.

     If anyone ever wants to correspond and discuss movies, new and old,
directing styles, genres, or anything about movies, write me a letter via US
Mail, or write to my net address.

     Speaking of movies, I learned something interesting about "Pretty Woman".
A fairly inexperienced writer originally wrote the script for the film and
showed it to Richard Gere's agent.  The agent declined the movie, but then
hired a more well-known and experienced writer to write the very same idea
over into another script, which was the one used for the film.  The person
whose idea they stole sued and won $14 million.

     What makes me laugh is that "Pretty "Woman" was a mediocre film that does
not translate well into the reality of our times.  Julia Roberts' charachter
was a hooker, who stated that she was "safe" because she used condoms. 
Condoms have a failure rate as high as 1 in 10, and someone who had as many
contacts with different people is bound to become exposed to HIV. It's just a
matter of time. A hooker who uses condoms is still not "safe".  Also, the
subject matter of the movie gives the wrong message about women: it
overemphasized the Julia Roberts' charachter's appearance and completely
disregarded the fact that she was a hooker. Finally, the production itself
provided nothing of real artistic merit. Just goes to show you what type of
junk the American public will go for.

     Are you a fan of the late 60's British TV show The Prisoner? It's a
fascinating show in which the individual, the government, and society are
examined and criticized.  If you would like to join Six of One, The Prisoner
Appreciation Society, you may send a self-addressed stamped envelope to:

     By the way, any fans of "The Prisoner" that would like to discuss that
show can also e-mail me or snail-mail me. I could talk for hours about it!

     Anyone see the video of the LA cops beating up a man? It was pretty
gruesome. It was seen in all over the US and in 60 countries. A great image of
the US being sent out there.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<< from various places in the bitstream >>>>>>>>>>

        Greetings, folks.  Here's a few handy hints on how to handle some of
those annoying little problems you may come accross in your various travels
away from your terminal.

        Problem:  You're out trashing and looking around, and you come accross
one of those cheapo little locks with the zig-zag type keyhole.

        Solution: Handy dandy lockpick by Ronco---namely, the old fashioned
paper clip.  Just open in up and bend the ends into teardrop shaped loops. 
The smaller end for small locks, the larger for larger ones. Put the loop all
the way in, jiggle around and twist back and forth, Presto! It really works, I
have three of these kind of locks at home from various sources.  With a little
practice, one of these mediocre pieces of security hardware will take no more
time to get by than if you had the key.  These little beauties may be found on
toolsheds, toolboxes, cellar doors and mailboxes everywhere someone is too
cheap to spend the extra couple bucks for a better lock.  Those are another
story (working on it).

        Problem:  You never know when the police are around (never when YOU
need 'em tho).

        Solution:  Carry a hand held scanner (der!).  Radio Shack will be
happy to sell a 2-channel one for about $50.00 or so.  Keep it on to see who
gets sent where.  If you can't receive tach 2, assume the worst when you hear
them talking about going to it or calling in by phone.  The hassle you save
could be your own.

        Problem:  When you absolutely, positively have to trash a disk or VCR
tape, and don't think delete filename or re-recording will cut it.

        Solution: Build yourself an electromagnet out of an iron or steel bar
with as much small wire wrapped around it as possible.  If you don't think
there is enough wire to make much resistance, add one of those metal resistors
that have 10 watts or more ratings in series.  Also put in series a doorbell
buzzer or other temporary contact switch.  Connect each end of the wire to a
normal plug socket, and put the whole thing into a briefcase or cloth bag to
carry.  When you need it, take it out, plug it in, and push the button on and
off VERY quickly.  The resultant 60 hz oscillating magnetic fields will have a
lot of power and will wipe any media you put near the ends of the magnet. 
Caution: insulate everything, as 110v AC with up to 15 or 30 amps is dangerous
(stuck a hairpin in a socket at age 4, maybe that's why I'm a little strange?
<cackle>).  Also, leave your credit cards and ID's with magnetic strips home,
or you will have to get new ones. This is also a good trick if you want to
'zap' your friend's wallet as he/she comes near the device.  It might be days
or more before they stick that bank card in the slot to see "invalid card #"
on the ATM display.  yuk yuk.


*********************  Commentary ***************************


       Economy:  Mostly due to the party of the Reagan decade. The bill is in,
folks, and the ones that chowed down at the party don't want to pay.  Milken
can steal 600 million (that we know about) and get 10 years or less with good
behavior, but let some minority hold up a gas station for 345.67 and he'll get
15-20 with no parole.  Businesses are laying off because they claim they have
to be competetive, and they can't be paying employees a living wage when 3rd
world countries have labor for 1/10 that.  We're all gonna be serving the
Japanese at 3.00/hr and damn glad to have the jobs pretty soon unless this
crap stops. If you ever get into a bank or insurance company database, wipe
them out and leave a message 'power to the people -----economic justice or
death'.

        Problem: Your colony is invaded by unstoppable, acid-blooded alien
monsters, and you can't get up.

        Solution: You'll have to nuke the site from orbit, its the only way to
be sure.  :) :) :) (<----necessary?)

                        Later, eh?

     Well, we luckily got out of this war without major casualties and without
a draft. We might not be so lucky next time.  The following column was sent to
me while the war was still in progress, but I'm including this fellow's
thoughts on the draft because war just may happen again. Think about it. We
got through this one with major public support. The spectre of Vietnam is now
erased from the public's mind. And since the war was "won", another one will
be much easier to pull over on the public. And next time we might not be as
lucky in the area of casualties.



THOUGHTS ON THE DRAFT - By The Atomic Punk

The way the war was progressing in the Gulf, it looked like a draft was
eminent. The fact is, if you are drafted and refuse to fight you will go to
jail. The paradox is-how can it be illegal to kill someone and then suddenly
be illegal to NOT kill someone? The thing that makes this country great is
freedom. If it was truly free, however, people would have a CHOICE of whether
they wanted to fight or not. If enough people chose not to fight, then the
country should not be at war. Why make life hard for those who do not agree
with the war? I find it pretty sick that it may soon mean jail for those who
don't like the idea of taking part in such an uncivilized thing as war.  Also:
kids not old enough to drink should not be considered old enough to die.

If you do not feel like being pulled out of your life, sent somewhere to a
faraway land for reasons you may not agree with and had no control over, and
shot, blown up, infected or gassed there are places a conscientious objector
can go without being sent to prison for up to 5 years and have the blemish of
a jail record which will hold them back in the future. There are sanctuaries
(churches) where it is illegal to be arrested, and some towns have declared
themselves santuaries.  However, to me it doesn't sound too cool to drop my
whole life & move across the country just to avoid going to prison or being
killed. The best idea is to work to get your own town (or one close by) or
college made into a sanctuary. One way to start is for you and your friends to
xerox flyers and put them under windshields at the local supermarket.  Try
talking to the town council, if possible generate propaganda with a local
radio station or a public access TV station.  If someone just sits on their
ass instead of working for change, they are to blame. Later.....
