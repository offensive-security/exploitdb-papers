So, here it is. another pfine pap production.

Saturday afternoon, an attack on Pfizer and General Dynamics will begin.
We're not gonna key in on those two, you can go to the function if you wanna
know more about THEIR enviro- problems. (Fort Griswold Park, Sat., Sept 24,
10am) We're gonna try tackling some of the less obvious companies in our
locale here.
  First, a very short word on Pfizer.  The only major company left in South-
eastern Connecticut that hasn't pulled out of South Africa.
  Next a quick word on GD.
  ATI recently did a special survey of the Electric Joke shityard grounds for
ARDIS (John Stockwell's group) and Del- Aware (Abbie Hoffman's band of weary
travelers) to see if EB could do any sneaky shit under the FEMA project. We
concluded that it would be too hard to convert any buildings from their
current purpose over to concentration camps for the blacks and dissidents as
per Louis Guiffrida's "California Paper".
  2 days after the document hit the post office, General Dynamics announced
the go-ahead for a large toxic waste incinerator.
  Now what could a conservative state do with a row of large stoves??? At any
rate, we all know that EB and Pfizer are naughty. Let's list a few other local
bad boys.


1)Mystic Color Lab     1)silver 2 EB                   2 toxic waste 3
pfizer               3 t. w.  4)Dow                  4)latex sux!!!
5)Hess                 5)Waste oil 6)Soneco               6)can you say
                         cyanide.?.  7)Millstone            7)lubricants
                         ind. waste.  8)Naval base           8)old diesel
9)Ming Garden          9)grease traps 0)Evans Shell          0)waste oil in
                         sewers.

...   ...   ...

where's doug???

...   ...   ...

Mystic Color Lab got nailed last month for dumping excess quantities of silver
into the river. They were supposed to undergo weekly monitoring; but lo and
behold!!! They've suddenly cut back enormously.
  Is this real?
  The silver that's being dumped is what's left after 3 attempts to
electronically pan out each silver molecule. What's left cannot be gotten.
The silver (alone or joined) is VERY dangerous to plant life in and out of the
rivers. To meet standards, MCL has attached a 3rd chemical making it LOOK like
they've cleaned up their act.
  Bullshit.
  MCL is still damaging us.

  As we said, EB is doing mega toxic waste. EB is also responsible for a large
portion of our nation's acid rain problems.
  So is Pfizer. Some suggest AIDS got its genesis at an African branch of
Pfizer Corp.
  A word on DOW: ever get really sick from lighting a styrofoam cup on fire?
One cup? Dow, burns about 1000 cups worth of styrofoam a day.
  Hess? Waste oil is no fun. This stuff shows up in the Thames river now and
then. Fish dont like waste oil. You know things are bad when you open up a can
of tuna (in its own oils) and you see a tiny little barge floating around
trying to make a delivery and it asks you where the dock is between Pfizer and
EB.
  Soneco burns all their boxes instead of trucking them out to New Jersey. Too
expensive. These boxes are chemically treated so they're strong enough to hold
harsh stuff.
  Millstone is responsible for a LOT of industrial waste. It's not just for
radiation any more. hehehe. You'll see a lot of lubricants and shaved up
metals floating around in Waterford's waters.
  The Naval base stored up diesel fuel for the past 40 years. They simply ran
out of room on the lower base. So, now they burn up about 3 drums a day. 35
year old diesel fuel has a distinctive odor. Much like raw bat-shit.
  Ming Garden. Why did MG make our hit- list? Don't panic. It's not for their
way of handling the excess kitten population; although rumors fly. Ming Garden
their greasetraps right down into the ground at the end of each night.  Ever
wonder where crabgrass comes from?
  Evans Shell. Again; another purely arbitrary assignment. This guy's gonna
have to take the heat for ALL the service stations that clean engines right
over a sewer grate. Also going into these sewer grates are any leftover,
useless, (and very potent) oils and assorted solvents.
  There you have it. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Apple core; say no
more.

                          collectin our debts just like the rest of em!!!)
  The all new FNORD TORMENT.
  100% stainless steel tires that whir at 30 MPH; and scream really high at
60.
  FNORD TORMENT has 20 foot tunable hydraulic shocks for slipping over VW's in
heavy traffic.
  The TORMENT has a LARGE hood scoop that eats mosquitos, gnats, and medium
sized birds and water foul; converting them to fuel.
  A 32 character LED panel in the window is for typing in obscenities at
tailgators, and would-be tailgators. Also serves as a written warning in
advance of Super-illuso-brakes.
  Toggle break lights are there for when you dont want to actually use your
breaks; but you want to get someone off your ass while still maintaining an
accelleration.
  For those not shaken up by FNORD TORMENT's fake brakelights; uzi-lookin
things pup up out the tailfins. And for unbelievers: fullsized ammo.
  For people who wont turn off their highbeams, a megawatt Amtrak Halogen
light on the front. Part # w.att.1k; commonly referred to as the "DEATH RAY".
  New TORMENT D-Day style launch pad allows marbles and glass tacks to roll
out back from the underside of the FNORD TORMENT.
  12" woofers and 5" piezos with a drop-in overhead microphone, are stock with
this FNORD for announcing things like, "get the fuck outa the way", or "sunday
driver".
  Special option can be ordered for this FNORD model: a wireless helmet with a
built in condenser mic and infra red goggles for night driving when you just
dont feel like turning on your lights.
  Drunk drivers got you down? Someone weaving in and out, taking away your
concentration? Maybe endangering your life? Turn on the special glowlights
that whisper a shimmering flow from one side of the FNORD to the other making
his world spin sideways. The drunk will lose all judgement and go wail an
embankment or guardrail all by himself.
  Th TORMENT is an electronically fuel injected turbo-charged all terrain
  As hightech as this vehicle is; The FNORD TORMENT'S alarm system is still a
female pit bull terrier.

AN EYE ON THE STRIKE
  With Hurricane Gilbert dead and gone, outpuffed and petered out, done went
and skidaddled, there's a new storm brewin in rotten Groton, Connecticut.
  Electric Joke has filed an "unfair strike" charge against the MTC. (metal
trades council)
  Admin says they only gave 29 days notice; MTC claims they gave

84. It's a quiet strike; you can drive up or down Eastern Point Road without
fear of getting your car tipped over.
  So far.
  Other unions across the nation have promised to show up and help out when
the going gets rough. People promising are the Teamsters, the United
Paperworkers, Entertainment Guild, and Ronald Reagan.
  Past rallies have been fair to midland considering the weather and stuff.
Next rally is scheduled for Saturday, October 8. This is apparently going to
be held at one of the main gates. this seems to be a union that refuses to be
broken. We'll have to wait and see.

following what i learned as a kid. he asked me what i was talking about. i
said well if i put the kleenex in the garbage can what would it be. he said
garbage. ok, and if i put the kleenex on the ground what is it. he said
litter. i said good, i was just putting litter in its place. he laughed so
hard he let me go.

  NO ONE HAS more to say lyrically about our environment than Little Steven.
Here's a few quips from the guy.
  "The land is my mother
   she is worth dying for.
   I've walked the path of peace
   but I aint runnin no more.

  "THey've got their silver and gold.
   Money wont be enough.
   When they try to explain to children
   Why they've poisoned their own blood

  "As long as the 4 winds blow
   Our spirits remain
   The 4 winds will never
   Blow away America's shame.
