
this is ATI, activist times, inc.

YIPPIE!!!    
It starts with advisors.
The Central Intelligence Agency feels 
some sort of need to sell drugs, trade
arms, assassinate communists, 
fascists, and capitalists for fun, and
stick their noses in everybody's 
business.
  You work for them for years. They 
make you do things you'd never tell 
mom about. They start making you do 
things you can't even "tell yourself 
about".
  Somewhere along the line you realize
that what started out travel, large 
pay, excitement, adventure, making the
world safe for democracy; has become 
robbery, embezzlement, murder, 
wirefraud, terrorism, corruption, 
murder, piggishness, murder, 
subversion, and murder.
  NOW COMES QUITTING TIME.
  John Stockwell speaks to us from his
experiences working as a CIA agent. 
He's speaking at URI today. He may 
have spoken at your school already; 
you may be on his "road list" for '88 
- '89.
  Listen to the horror stories. Ponder
his analagies. Make his experiences; 
your experiences. while you do; ask 
yourself, "Do I want the CIA on my 
campus recruiting?"
  Personally, I think if CIA would 
hold a public debate allowing people 
like me and you to ask real questions,
they'd be8;9e than welcom to use one 
of our rooms for interviews and 
answering any questions a "budding 
agent" might have.
  But if you want to drive in and park
your tinted windows in front of the 
Union, grabbing a helicopter out back 
going to the fieldhouse and then board
a piperplane parachuting over the 
alumni building and escorting about 75
uniformed police officers thru the 
side door; then...
  GET THE FUCK OFF MY CAMPUS.




I SURVIVED RUTGERS '88.
It was the best Be-In I've ever been 
to.
  3 or 4 days of gathering, 
fellowship, brainstorming, ideas, 
entertainment, tabling, leafletting, 
hell. We even allowed the fascists a 
table.
  It was exciting, it was awesome, but
nothing "solid" happened from it.
  Yet.
  I would like to cite 4 units for 
making Rutgers happen, and holding the
thing together. If by a thin thread 
that started to look really frazzling.

  1 <-=-Christine   2 <-=-Edwardo  3 <
-=-Stewart  4 <-=-The rest of the 
Rutgers hosts and assorted yellow-arm-
banded delegates.
  I'll also share 2 schools who came 
bearing something solid they wanted to
bring back with them. <1> MIT  <2> 
Berkley. Something old, something new,
borrowed and blue too. 
Old? Berkley. One of the oldest 
freethinkin colleges Amerika has to 
offer. Why not? It's California. 
New? MIT. They call Massachussetts 
home. Probably the first state that'll
legallize marijuana. Amherst? Boston? 
CZ? Dukakis? Somethin brewin!!!
Borrowed? The whole idea behind a 
constitution. 
Blue? People bummed out that nothing 
really "happened". The black caucous 
ripped us to shreds Sunday morning, 
showing us for what we really are, and
still most overcome:
  Slightly racist, semi homophobic, 
somewhat ready to gather but not quite
ready for a constitution.
  I say fine. Let's keep in touch, 
relax, and get ready for what's sure 
to "glue" us together really fast.
WORLD TROUBLE!!!

The 3M's of organizing -- Media, 
Music, & Modem. By Steve Van Zandt, 
Marc Graham, and Abbie Hoffman.

The 60's weren't the greatest of times
or anything-- they sure were great-- 
but these may be the greatest of 
times.
  The 60's were the awakening of 
revolution and this is another step in
that revolution.
  School needs to be changed. We need 
to talk about more than the history 
they want us to believe. We need to 
get into the education process. The 
real history. The artist tries to 
stimulate thought. The media is really
the way to get across.
  We shut down Sun City overnight. 
Once the Billionaire owner showed up 
on Phil Donahue we knew we won. And 
the fact that we wasted him on 
National TV was icing on the cake.
  A new way of organization; a 
computer networking system. 
Communicate, share, co-ordinate, 
collaborate, update, type, edit, 
store, fast. Online worldwide. 
  Peacenet. 
  Amnesty International can type an 
Action Alert and get it to Greenpeace,
WRL, and SANE faster than you can hit 
your <enter> key. Since the users 
govern what information is sent, it is
unfiltered. Most of the news we get 
each day has been edited out and 
watered down. Not so as much with 
networking.








  Bitnet is a global network that 
makes the host system local to every 
college campus in the World.
  More than 650 are registered 
delegates as of this moment, 
representing over 130 schools. You've 
come despite freezing weather and hard
economic times to do something I'm not
sure anyone here is yet ready to 
comprehend. But, I'm absolutely 
convinced that you are making history.

  No one has done anything this bold, 
imaginative, creative, and daring. To 
bring this many strains of people 
together who all believe in the same 
kind of change...  Radical change is needed in our 
society. It's just an amazing feat; 
and I wish you the best of luck today 
and especially tomorrow as you make 
the decision whether to go backward or
forward.


RAMBLINGS   by the Third Shifter

1 am Sunday morning (saturday nite) A 
local cop comes in and buys a 
crossword puzzle book and a jumbo pack
of gum.
  "Long nite, eh?" I suggest.
  "Hmm."
  <car 3, respond to X st. broken down
vehicle> He turns up the volume on his
radio and concentrates. <check and see
if it's safety prob or not. Two black 
youths>
  He gives me the money and turns to 
leave.
  "Gotta roll," he says.
  "Hey," I tell him, "If it's a black 
kid and a Puerto Rican kid, take good 
care of 'em. They're pretty cool. From
my hometown. They just bought 2 quarts
of oil off of me."
  He grunted maybe; and left.
  I hope my THOUGHT stuck with him. He
looked like your typical "Jewbeater".

*Aint gonna send no money down
when there aint no money to spend
aint gonna station no troops down 
there
to kill someone else's best friend.
  Aint gonna fight no foreign wars
  dont even know what we're fighting 
for
  aint gonna fight no wars no more
  we shoulda learned that in the 60's
*Cant justify no homemade fight
or jammin our philosophys down their 
throats
cant rationalize no secret wars
we shoulda learned that in the 60's
*why cant we spend our money on things

that dont have to do with bombs n guns

why cant we send our food down there
instead we gotta act like the 60's

*in our efforts to show the world
how democracy and freedom can work
we find ourselves bossin people around

n advocating military states of war
*we find ourselves tied economically 
down
we oughta get our noses outa the fire
so we dont get our fat nostrils burnt
we never ever learned from the 60's.


MEGALOMODEMANIA   by Prime Anarchist

This is ATI's first hardcopy issue.
  ATI was born on an Atari personal 
computer February 9th when I returned 
from a New Jersey-Albany-NYC-
Providence stint which was a direct 
result of the Rutgers Convention.
  Other issues will come out as 
needed. (you'll probably see us at a 
few Dead shows, Terence D'Arby 
concerts, and maybe a Celtics game 
here and there)
  But for the most part, you can only 
get ATI online, using your modem at 
Infomaniack BBS. (401)596-8338
  If you feel you MUST DEMAND a 
printout of the latest activity 
online, send a SASE (a couple extra 
stamps inside might be nice) to:
Marco
PO Box 1211
Westerly, RI
02891
USA
  After interacting with so many 
hundreds of freethinking fellow 
humanoids I decided it's my obligation
to use everything I do in life to 
positive ends.
  Which means my guitar, my personal 
computer, and my journalism skills had
to be sold back to Free America. No 
more National Party Line letters to 
the editors, groovy love songs, or 
compuserve sex chats. It's time to 
live an active life. With trouble 
brewing in every single speck of our 
Earth, these are the times for 
activism.
  It is time for ATI.
