    Hello!  Welcome to ATI59.  It seems we're keeping up with our
monthly schedule, for now!
    In fact, we might even put out ATI60 in LESS than a month!  So,
look for at least one ATI per month, maybe more!
  
    First off: ATI's FTP Site:
      ftp.eff.org
      192.88.144.4
      /pub/cud
    
    Also, please send in BBS numbers to be posted in ATI60.  Please tell us:
    Board name
    Board telephone #
    Baud rates
    What is the board about?  H/P?  Pirate?  General discussion?
Special topic?


    And before we start, a few words on the Rodney King verdict and the
riots.  There was unrest in over a dozen cities, including nearby 
Newark and NYC.  
    The jury made its verdict not because of racism, but in reflection upon
the evidence.  We have a system here.  It's: innocent until proven guilty.
The jury felt that after examination of the COMPLETE tape (which showed King
seriously resisting arrest, kicking and fighting w/ the officers, etc.)
that they used the necessary force to subdue King.  And they didn't say ALL
of the four were innocent: the jury was hung as to one officer's guilt,
and he may be retried (expect to see him FRIED regardless of guilt or
innocence).
    The riots were thuggery, nothing more.  Now the death toll is close to 
50, and still rising.  Hundreds, of not thousands, were injured.  
The property damage in L.A. alone is over 100 million dollars.  Guess who pays
for it?  Look in the mirror.  Your tax dollars go to clean up the mess through
federal emergency funds, and you will also pay through higher insurance
premiums.
     Also: inner city businesses may not even be able to GET insurance after
this.  Business that provided jobs and commerce to the area are gone.
    And why didn't the politicians repudiate the violence?  All they said,
including King George, was, "We know how they feel", etc.  They should have
unconditionally renounced the violence, and dealt with it more strongly
with more police, military, etc.  Oh, and NJ senator Bill Bradley made
a DISGUSTING speech to the Senate, totally pandering to the rioters, the
thugs.
    And one of the greatest tragedies of this situation is this - the damage
to our judicial system.  All it says is that in some trials with the victim
being a Black person and the defendant being white (or Asian), the verdict
had better be guilty, or there'll be trouble.  I remember that happening in
a trial in NYC - or was it in Teaneck, NJ, where a white cop was charged
with shooting a Black teen?  Anyway, a Black individual (can't remember
who) went on TV and threatened "trouble" (unrest in the streets) if the
verdict was "not guilty".  Why wasn't he changed with jury tampering or
obstruction of justice?  JUSTICE CANNOT BE BULLIED. (btw.. the verdict
in the Teaneck trial was "not guilty" - no trouble followed).
    The Ventura (Calif.) Free Press printed the names, ages, and home AND
business addresses of the jurors in the King trial.  Why did they do that? 
That's deplorable.  I'll bet at least one of them gets hurt or even killed.

Ok, so it was more than a few words.. just had to get it off my chest.
If we come across more pertinent info, it'll be in ATI60.

We've got a lot of cool stuph for you, so on with the show!

THE MAIL BAG!

Do write to us!  We don't print names, etc. unless you ask us to.


  -- LETTER #1 --

A few comments on Croaker's letter in ATI58:
 
First off, there is a very good book on the NSA and the way it works,
called The Puzzle Palace, by James Bamford.. ISBN: 0-14-006748-5.
 
Secondly, as to the security of DES.. DES was recently (within the
last month or so) broken by Adi Shamir (one of the authors of RSA) and
Eli Biham.  They used what is called a "chosen-plaintext" attack,
which basically means you have to control the traffic being encrypted
by DES.  Not only that, but you have to control the contents of 2^36
different message, about 68 billion.  This would seem to show that DES
is a very secure algorithm, especially considering that it's been
around almost 20 years.  Research by the same team that finally broke
it has also shown that the changes made by NSA to the algorithm
(which was originally developed by IBM) strengthened it rather than
inserted a backdoor.
 
Now the Digital Signature Standard... this is the public-key algorithm
developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
association with NSA.  Not only is this considered a "weak" algorithm,
but a backdoor HAS been found in it.  It was discovered quickly after
the standard was released that if the "prime modulus" (the number upon
which all the keys, public and private, are based) is chosen
carefully, a digital signature can be forged at will.  This has once
again raised quite a bit of controversy over the NSA and its role in
civilian security issues.
 
Finally, the licensing of the RSA algorithm... it is perfectly legal
to make a program that uses the RSA algorithm (Pretty Good Privacy for
the IBM comes to mind) as long as you don't sell it.  The way the
copyright law works, you can't license a mathematical FACT, but you
can certainly copyright an algorithm.  Any computer program can be
considered ultimately mathematical in nature, so RSA can be
copyrighted just the same.  Also, I believe RSA is patented.  I'm not
at all sure about this, so if anyone knows better, please correct me. 
This could be done easiest by producing a chip that contains the RSA
algorithm and patenting the chip, which would also prevent the
production of derivative works.
 
Hope that was interesting to at least a few of you!!

    (Welp, we were all busy and lacking for time to put this thing
together, and prepare material for it.  But, it seems that we're 
going to be back on our monthly schedule from now on.  Thanks for
writing, and do keep reading!  -GZ)

Re: Activist Times Inc. #58

Man, you all need to put out more often...  I really
enjoy reading your posts.  I guess I just feel nostalgic
for the "old days"...  I have completely lost touch
with my hacker roots.  

What else do you all do for kicks? 

Cheers

     (Hmm, well, I personally enjoy reading, writing, music, guitar,
cow tipping, movies, road tripping, talking, making revolution,
cooking, radio (shortwave, scanners, broadcast, etc.), fones,
computers, and more.   How about you?   -GZ)



  -- LETTER #4 --

Subject: ATI 1

What happened to all those noble sentiments in ATI 1? The latest ATI
is an ALL-US issue, and ends up with a REALLY dumb filk about phreaking.
What happened to the *activist* part?


     (We're still activist.  We may not focus on the same things as we did
in the beginning.  We started four years ago, and Prime ran things back
in the days of ATI 1, and now I run them.   We're still dedicated to 
discussing the corruption and conspiracy that makes up our gov't, and this
issue should illustrate that in Prime's column and mine.
      What is your objection to the the US being widely discussed in our
last issue, or in ATI in general?  We do cover world events, but we can
only print the material we get or that I stumble upon.  Now that I am
listening to more shortwave, I will write about news I hear on the BBC
or other stations.  Also, in ATI57, we featured an article by Nosferatu
about political/economic issues in Norway & Europe. 
      And why MUST the world be covered?  Are you trained to be a nice
citizen in the New World Order(tm)?  Watch for ATI60, in which we
expose the N.W.O.
      If there's a topic or viewpoint you'd like to see in ATI, write
something, and send it in.  We'll use it, 95% gurantee.  :)    -GZ)
     

LETTER #5

  I'd like to subscribe to this GREAT magazine.
 
  BTW, the country mentioned in August 1991 issue was (ex) Yugoslavia. The
Yugoslav federal army (= Serbian army) occupied Slovenia.  After some days
of war they found out, that they cannot win the war and they left Slovenia
(last federal  soldier left Slovenia in October  1991). Then they occupied
Croatia (and destroyed almost everything), now they occupied Bosnia.  Hope
someone will stop Serbia soon.
                                                     Best regards

------->   ATI wants to hear from YOU!!!   -------->

        "Is there anybody out there?"

        The fact that we get letters and submissions from some of you 
proves that there are people reading us!  But - we want to know just
*how many* of you there are!
        So, we would like to hear from EVERYONE who is reading this!  If
you're reading ATI through our newsgroup or our email list, all you have
to do is REply to this, and we'll get your message.  You don't even have
to put anything in the body of the letter unless you want to make a 
comment (of course, we ALWAYS want comments).
        If you're reading this on a BBS or through some other means and you
don't have internet access, then you can contact us through WWIV-net
mail (33@2120) or U.S. Mail (ATI, P.O. Box 2501, Bloomfield, NJ 07003, USA).
        Now if you write to us via U.S. Mail, and if you enclose a business-
sized self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE), we will stuff it with articles
and other phun stuff, including a free SOCIAL INSECURITY card to the first 
90 people who write! (w0w!!1)  Even if you DO have internet access, write to
us.  We love getting mail, and it'll be fun sending you some phun stuff!!
        So, write to us, or send us internet or WWIV-net email. But, do

That's right!  Prime Anarchist comes live at 'ya with his occasional
column:

                      Prime Anarchist World News


2 predictions from the Primester:

        A) If George's ratings go below 49%, a war will begin within 36
hours.  Cuba?  Middle East?  Africa?  Haiti?  Colombia?  Pick a country. 
We're still ready everywhere.
        B) Upon inauguration (after re-election), George declares finally
that this country's in the midst of a depression.  As big as, if not larger
that, the "Great One" of 1929.
        So, get rid of your silver and gold and sore up all the foodstuffs
you can.  I'm having a great deal of trouble finding people to buy my metals
already.  And I don't wanna get stuck with it.  I may have to melt it down
and learn jewelry making, I think.


"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the White House Press Office", by ATI

        I dialed the White House Press Office one Tuesday afternoon. 
1-800-424-9090 usually gets you a 1-5 minute recording of George Bush's most
recent public rambling.  This was Raygun's number, and before that, 
Carter's.   One can only assume it went before that to Nixon and Ford.
        Usually, when you dial it, you know right away by the tone whether or
not there's something new or not.
        "This is the White House Press Office for _____________ (insert date
here)" means you get to hear today's rant-and-rave.
        "You have reached the White House Press Office, radio actualities
line.  We have no actualities at this time.  Thank you for calling and please
call again," is the only other message they use.
        Today I got both.
        At the same time.
        Simultaneous messages.  One was tomorrow's message, as the voice was
in the middle of saying "for Wednesday, etc," when a "click" interrupted, and
the friendly old dialtone came on.
        So.
        They have George's tomorow speech already cued up, and he hasn't even
given it yet!  What a crock of political bullshit.  Tell all your friends. 
This must get out.  Widespread - please.  The New World Order (tm) is only a
heartbeat away while you're waiting for the next few re-alignments and radio
actualities.


---> backtothepredictions --->

        Prime Prediction #3?  Sure.  Saddam Hussein buys his way into the New
World Order (tm) about 6 years from now, or however long it takes for people
to forget George's comparing him to Hitler.  After all, he is their
President.  Yes!! He won in a democratic election in 1980 (coincidentally
enough) against a man of last name Bakr (pronounced like the bread-maker). 
Yup.  At any rate, Hussein still hasn't returned all the gold, silver,
platinum, and silicon he stole from Kuwait.  So, to every world leader, a
price.  What'll it be?  Gold?  Platinum?  Oil?  Hmm. He's got it.  Wait and
see..
        PAWN has no major numbers run this time around.  Maybe next
time.
        Prime Anarchist is not a Ecodefense monkeywrench warrior, but he
says, "let's put these oil companies back where they belong -- back in the
ground."
        Don't burn coal,

              Prime.

* shortwaves *

        In the last issue, I wrote about some former pirate radio people
who broadcast Sunday nights on WWCR.  Well, I wrote to them, and sent them
a reception report.  I heard back from them, and got my very first QSL
card (when you send a reception report, they send you a QSL that lists
the time and date you listed on your report, confirming the contact).
I'm new to shortwave, so it was a big thrill for me!  I also got a short
writeup on them, and their broadcast schedule.  Here it is:

RADIO NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL - Earth sensitive alternative radio for the
U.S. and the world

   "RNI is the former offshore station of the RADIO SHIP SARAH.  We offer
a wide range of pacifist, counter culture, live telephone talk and music
programs.  For free schedule and advertising information, to send letters
and music for broadcast, or to order RNI THE VIDEO, an 87-minute VHS
history and tour of the radio ship ($29.95), RNI AUDIO TAPE, the first hour
of ship-board radio ($15.00), RNI MONTAGE, a 10-minute audio history 
($9.95) or RNI T-SHIRTS, 100% cotton black with white logo ($17.00), write
to: RNI, 14 Prospect Dr., Yonkers, NY 10705"

   Schedule:  Sundays: 9 PM - 1 AM EST.,on WWCR, 7.435 MHz 
            Saturdays: 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM EST  and
                       12 Mid. - 2 AM EST on R.F.P.I. Costa Rica 
                       13.630 MHz


        So, give these guys a listen.  They're fun.  I don't agree with
their leftist politics, but I still like 'em.
        Has anyone found a pirate station?  If so, contact me and let me
know the frequency, time, etc.  I can't wait to hear a bona fide pirate
broadcast!
        As I said last time - check out For The People from 8pm-10pm EST
weekdays, and Radio Free America from 10 pm - Mid. EST weekdays on
WWCR, 7.435 MHz.
        

* Indians *

        An Indian tribe (the name escapes me) set up a casino in their 
reservation in Ledyard, CT.  This brings many jobs and commerce to that
area, which has been hard-hit by the recession (btw, that's Prime 
Anarchist's former home and still home to Fah-Q), and puts lots of money
in those Indians' pockets, all of which is good.
        BUT - I don't like the fact that the Indians can form their little
enclaves separate from the U.S.  The state of Connecticut denied the 
Indians' original request to build the casino, but the Indians overrode it
in court, using their status as a separate Indian "nation", autonomous
>from the U.S. (when the Indians get gov't aid, that "autonomy" doesn't
come into play, hmm).
        --->  PRIME ANARCHIST UPDATE:  Prime is walking cross-country
with the Big Mountain Indians to protest the whole Big Mountain sitaution.
They are all due to arrive in Washington, D.C. on Columbus Day.
        Now, I happen to think the Big Mountain Indians were screwed over 
by the gov't and have a legitimate beef.  But why must they make their
point on Columbus Day?  I am tired of all these people protesting 
Columbus' discovery (yeah, I know he didn't find it first - his claim to
fame is opening up the New World for settlement and commerce) of America.
To reject Columbus' discovery is to reject America and its ideals.  This
country was founded on noble principles.  That's all I have to say on the
matter, for now...


* Social INsecurity*

        How many of you out there are counting on Social Security and
Medicare to take care of you in your old age?
        Within the next 20 years, the Social Security system (and most
likely Medicare as well) will have to be drastically modified or replaced.
Representatives of Social Security even admit that Medicare is solvent only
until 2006 (That's only 14 years away), and that Social Security goes 
"up for discussion" in 2032.
        Social Security doesn't "save" the money you pay into it for you.  It
pays current beneficiaries with the money you and others are currently paying
into it.
        Back when Social Security was started in the 1930's, the ratio of
working people was 15:1.  In the 1980's, it was down to 3:1.  When the baby
boomers retire, it will be much worse.  It is estimated that by the year
2025, the ratio will be down to 2:1 (I will not have reached retirement age
by then, and most of you reading this will not have either).  By that time,
Social Security taxes will have to exceed a whopping 22% of your gross
salary!!!  (That's SUI alone - you will also have to pay federal, state and
possibly local taxes.)
        Efforts to increase the Social Security Trust Fund by other means
fall short.  The only thing Social Security can invest in is federal
government securities, thus making future retirees merely creditors of the
bankrupt federal gov't.  
        ADVICE: 1.  Do your own saving and investing for your retirement.
Do some reading on retirement and estate planning.
        2. Pressure your Senators and Congressman to reform Social Security.
The AARP (Ass'n for the Advancement of Retired People), one of the nation's
biggest lobbies, has opposed any moves to reform SS.  But - clearly THEY are
the only ones who benefit from things as they are.  Even if SS survives, no
other generation will receive the level of benefits the current beneficiaries
are receiving, and Social Security representatives admit this.  Also, Social
Security is raising the full benefit retirement age to 67 by 2027, in hopes
that people will remain working until then and also more people will die
before receiving Social Security.
        Remember, if you send us here at ATI a SASE as described in the
our appeal for reader contact, we'll send you articles, other phun stuff,

* the October Surprise *

        Wowzerz.  I just heard somewhere that the reporter who originally
exposed the October Surprise is dead.  The authorities say it was a
suicide, but his wrists were slashed all the way through tendons.  They
were slashed in such a way that once one wrist was cut, he couldn't have
used that arm to cut the other wrist.  This is old news I guess, but it's
new to me.  
        Also, I just heard on Radio New York International that Pam Am
Flight 103 (the one that got blown away by terrorists over Lockerbee,
Scotland) had eight CIA agents that were enroute to testify, substantiating
the October Surprise allegations. 
        Can anyone give me more information about these two things?
