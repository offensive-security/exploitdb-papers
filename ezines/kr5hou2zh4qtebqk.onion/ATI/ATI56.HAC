        Now for those of you who might be new to reading ATI - we start

more.  Here we go!

ATI is going on its fourth year as your first source of underground news.

ATI is Activist Times Inc., an underground online newsletter with a
mission: to present information and opinion in a socially relevant and
stimulating context.  ATI features articles about and for the computer
underground, telecom, BBSing, anarchy, current events, social issues, humor ,
entertainment and more.  ATI is into politics, the environment, technology,
the telephone, and mostly the First Amendment.

Prime Anarchist is the originator of ATI and its co-editor along with
Ground Zero, who is also its publisher.  Prime began ATI around February,
1988 as an online newsletter on bulletin boards in Rhode Island and New
York, in addition to producing a few issues on hard copy.  Soon ATI spread
to the downloading sections of bulletin boards across the country, most
notably The Phoenix Project, Ripco, Atlantis, and P-80 Systems.

ATI has a long list of present and past contributors, and has been known
to present articles that conveyed a unique twist of humor. The titles speak
for themselves: "Terrorism of a 976 Phone Sex Line", "Quantum Mix-Up", "Mall
Terrorism", "Fun in Rich Rural Towns", and many others.

In fact, some of the originators of YIPL/TAP magazine ghostwrote some
articles in 88 and 89. Some of the ghosts' initials (for you yipsters) were
RF, norfolk Virginia; CC, NYC; AH, Penn; FS, NYC; FS, Rhode Island; & A1,
NYC.

        Now for something completely different.  What about getting the
government off the backs of the people?  
        The NJ State Legislature passed a law that stated that social
workers had to be licensed - had to pass a test and pay a fee to a
new state bureaucracy created just for this task.  This is done, notice,
in a climate in which jobs are supposed to be cut from gov't
payrolls, not created.
        Now New Jersey has done it again.  NJ is about to enact 
legislation requiring software designers to be licensed.  This affects 
a very large number of people who work in the computer industry.  It
will undoubtedly force many out of the profession who are qualified and
competent.
        And now, for your reading pleasure, the assembly bill itself:



                               ASSEMBLY, NO. 4414 
 
                              STATE OF NEW JERSEY

The "Software Designers' Licensing Act." 
 
This bill came from a friend of mine who saw it in a Compu$erve thread. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I have been reading a Compu$erve thread that describes a bill now in 
committee in the New Jersey State Assembly. 
 
This bill, A-4414, would license "software designers" in the state of 
New Jersey, and would require any person working in the business to have 
this license (renewable every 2 years, with a fee, of course). 
 
I have attached a copy of the text of the bill as currently amended.  If 
you would like to write or call someone about the bill, here are some 
names and addresses.  Don't wait too long, this thing is currently in  
committee, and ICCA says it will come up for a vote around September!

I have placed some ideas for what to write (in case you're stuck) so that 
your elected officials will know your opinion. 
 
 
1)  How can one test cover all software designers from Government Contractors 
    to Video game designers? 
 
	a) Assuming the lowest common denominator, pleasee tell me which state 
	   codes are pertinent to Video Game Software Design and would require 
	   a license to insure that the programmer designs the game according 
	   to NJ state standards? 
 
2) How much will it cost? 
	a) How many people will be licensed? 
	b) How much will each pay? 
	c) Why isn't the fee listed in the Bill's proposal (or at least a cap)? 
	d) How much will it cost NJ: 
		i) How many mailings will be necessary for each person? 
		ii) How many sheets of paper will have to be sent? 
		iii) How much postage will it cost? 
		iv) How many people will we need to ADD to NJ's staff to handle the 
		    licensing, testing, and paper handling? 
 
3) Who were the voters which you represent that requested this bill? 
 
 
Please feel free to mention to these publicly elected officials that their 
names were listed NATIONWIDE, not just in NJ. 
 
 
Remember...if you don't write or call, they will not know your opinion.

        Greetings, earthlings.
        DETROIT, MI. - A new practice called "carjacking" is very popular
here.  Detroit has proved to be a leader in per capita crime rates such
as murder (it's #2 in the nation, next to D.C.), and is the leader in
carnapping.  Car thieves have found car security systems so elaborate, 
that as of late they are relying on carjacking - pulling people out of
their cars while stopped at red lights.  The car thieves find this
easier than trying to outsmart high-tech security systems, and they can
take their pick of any car they see stopped at a light.  Carjacking
is getting to be more widespread across the nation, but Detroit is in the
lead, as usual.
        A new drug has been developed that has been proven to shrink 
tumors in breast and ovarian cancer patients.  But - the drug is made
with materials found in Pacific area trees inhabited by - you 
guessed it - spotted owls.  As a result, enviromaniacs are pushing to 
prevent production of the drug.  To them, a few trees and owls are
more important to human life.
        Anyone listen to Paul Harvey News?  It's a 5-minute news spot
heard on different stations, including WOR in New York.  I heard this
item there:
        Some Italian college students were having fun actually drawing
fake stamps to be used as real stamps.  And it worked.  They mailed
letters with their phony stamp designs, such as "Annual Streetwalkers'
Day", "Mafia Bicentennial", and more.  Before they stopped this
endeavor, they made one stamp saying, "Check stamps more carefully.  This
one could be fake!".  When they mailed the letter with this "stamp",
it went through!
        See you again soon.

[Yeah I heard about that there hacker...we've got total control
   of this bridge.]
[Mercy sakes alive looks like we've got us a conference!]

(Narration)
'twas the dark of the moon on the sixth of june
 by a bright green telephone box
Hacker was there, with his usual flair,
 he opened up all of the locks.
We were looking for codes, inside the doors,
 anything we could find.
I said hacker this here's the Superphreak
 and we're about to switch the line.


(Chorus)
Cuz we got an elite conference, much to our delight
We got elite access, we hackers give Bell a fright.
so join us on this conference now don't you tell no fed.
Cuz if you squeal and narc dude, your phoneline will go dead.
Coooooooonference.......


[Yeah hacker this here's the phreak, you wanna give me them new codes?]
[Mercy sakes alive old man, 950's just aren't safe anymore!]

(Narration)
By the time we got into their PBX we had 85 phreakers in all
But there was a tap inside the old CO and them feds they taped our call
Them feds were thicker than shit on a shingle
As if we even cared......
I said calling all hackers this here's the phreak
Them feds, they think we're scared! (We're Not)

(Chorus)
Cuz we got an elite conference, much to our delight
We got elite access, we hackers give Bell a fright.
so join us on this conference now don't you tell no fed.
Cuz if you squeal and narc dude, your phoneline will go dead.
Coooooooonference.......

[Hey Phreak you wanna give me a 3-way on this here thing?]
[No way there hacker, you're just not elite enough for it]
[My goodness you can't even hack out a PCP!]
[Mercy sakes get yourself an education!]

(Narration)
Well we called up everyone we could call
Till the system almost failed.
We used up all of our 950's and used up our voice mail.
By the time our call went all world wide, them feds were gettin smart
They called in some reinforcements from England's Scotland yard.
There's wired taps, and traps and beeps and traces of every kind
Yeah them stupid lines were full of feds cuz we didn't pay a
   goddamned dime
Well we pushed our buttons and went for broke with a million
   fucking calls
With 11 long haired friends of Ground Zero in total control of it all.

[Yeah Ground Zero this here's phreak]
[yeah phreak what can we do for ya?]
[you wanna put us on another line?]
[We're using an AT&T and we need all the protection we can get.]

(Narration)
Well we laid a trunk for our last connection.
Prepared to use satellites
I could see the line was tapped to start
But we didn't get much of a fright
I said hacker this here's the Superphreak
we don't pay for our fuckin calls
So we trashed the box with all it's locks
And watched the Baby Bells fall...alright!

(Chorus)
Cuz we got an elite conference, much to our delight
We got elite access, we hackers give Bell a fright.
so join us on this conference now don't you tell no fed.
Cuz if you squeal and narc dude, your phoneline will go dead.
Coooooooonference.......

[Say what Ground Zero?]
[Them feds think you're where?]
[Omaha?!?!?!?!]
[Oh well, them feds are stupid anyway.]
[Keep on phreakin and keep on hackin.]
[Keep the feds off your tail...]
[we're cuttin the connection and we'll see ya later]
[Bye Bye........]
