LETTERS!!@$%!


LETTER #1:

I Really loves the ATI MAG!

L8r.

(Thanks!! -GZ)



LETTER #2:

RE: "The Problem of 'Widebanding' Information" by Anonymous (ATI61)

The author of that article failed to point out any alternatives to the
setup the computer underground has now.  How can information be shared
without compromising it, or having it fall into the wrong hands?

(I don't know..maybe if everyone sent in suggestions we can come up
with some solution.  Send in your ideas, people! -GZ)



LETTER #3:

i have encountered my first [sort of] realtime issue of ati under
interesting circumstances...in the course of a trip, and accessing this
account through a sort of loophole [physically i am in australia, where
i have *no* accounts!] in the network of a uni at which i have never been
a student..

and then to read justin case's story 'arrested', (from ATI61) when just to
my rear are the Brisbane city gardens which appears to be intensively
policed each weekend, mostly to drive out drug use and dealing and homeless
kids i suppose, and on my way here i saw two police getting a guy to blow
into a bag... it's intersting how topical a.t.i suddenly feels! :)



LETTER #4:

Thanks for publishing the story "Arrested" by Justin Case.  I wonder how
many tax dollars were wasted in that fiasco by the City of New York.




GROUND ZERO says:

        Ok, people.  We got some other comments on the "Arrested!" article.
Let's do this:  Last issue we published "Arrested!", and also the story
of a young Japanese man who was harrased by law enforcement while he was
trying to board a plane.  If YOU have a story about being arrested under
questionable circumstances, or being wrongly harrased by police or other
law enforcement agents, send it in.
        And do read on for yet another shocking story of an encounter with
the police: the raiding of (hacker meeting) PUMP-CON!!!


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And again, from our "Slices of Life" department and our "THIS could
happen to YOU!" department, we bring you...

Computer Access Arrests In NY 11/03/92
GREENBURGH, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 NOV 3 (NB) -- The
Greenburgh, New York Police Department has announced the arrest of
three individuals, Randy P. Sigman, 40; Ronald G. Pinz, Jr, 21; and Byron
J. Woodard, 18 for the alleged crimes of Unauthorized Use Of A computer
and Attempted Computer Trespass, both misdemeanors. Also arrested was
Jason A. Brittain, 22  in satisfaction of a State of Arizona Fugitive From
Justice warrant.

The arrests took place in the midst of an "OctoberCon" or "PumpCon"
party billed as a "hacker get-together" at the Marriott Courtyard Hotel in
Greenburgh. . The arrests were made at approximately 4:00 AM on
Sunday morning, November 1st. The three defendants arrested for
computer crimes were granted $1,000 bail and will be arraigned on
Friday, November 6th.

Newsbytes sources said that the get together, which had attracted up to
sixty people, had dwindled to approximately twenty-five when, at 10:00
Saturday night, the police, in response to noise complaints arrived and
allegedly found computers in use accessing systems over telephone lines.
The police held the twenty-five for questioning and called in Westchester
County Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Citarella, a prosecutor versed
in computer crime, for assistance. During the questioning period, the
information on Brittain as a fugitive from Arizona was obtained and at
4:00 the three alleged criminal trespassers and Brittain were charged.

Both Lt. DeCarlo of the Greenburgh police and Citarella told Newsbytes
that the investigation is continuing and that no further information is
available at this time.

------->  more info on the "Pump-Con" raid!!!   by Ground Zero


        The police arrived around 10 pm with the hotel manager and entered
the room.  They took computer printouts that they saw lying around,
and left.  But they detained all 25 people in the room.
        Some people question the legality of the police taking those
printouts, but others claim that since the printouts were in "plain
sight", they did not need a warrant to take the items.
        The police returned with a search warrant around 1:30 am.
        Every one of the 25 people detained in the room was questioned, and
also frisked.  Two of the 25 people were females, and they were frisked
by male officers who made sexually harrasing comments while
frisking them, such as "lift up your shirt," etc.
        It was revealed that one man who was being detained was in the
military and had a security clearance.  The police could not question him
because of this.  That individual was taken away by MP's (military police)
and interrogated by them.
        One young man who was being interrogated by the police was so
upset over the situation that he puked all over the floor and expressed
concern that this incident might prevent him getting a job with the CIA
in the future (gee, a GREAT career aspiration!).
        The police made four arrests, and finally let the others go
around 7:30 am.  It was quite a disturbing experience for all, especially
for that poor fellow who puked all over the place (Remember the "poem"
called "Slipping on Chunks" that appeared in ATI60?  Well, we're doing
a "Slipping on Chunks II" in this issue in honor of this occasion!!).


-------> RELATED STORY: 914 hacker raided 5 days after Pump-Con raid!!


        A 914 hacker was raided on Thursday, Nov. 5.  Pretty interesting
timing, eh?  (Greenburgh, NY is in the 914 NPA)


-------> 2600 Meeting in DC Raided!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        2600 Magazine (a quarterly magazine discussing hacking, phreaking,
etc.) holds meetings on the first Friday of the month in New York City,
Washington DC, San Francisco, and other cities.
        On Friday, Nov. 6, the mall security in the mall where the DC
2600 meeting is held raided the 2600 meeting.  They stated they were
making this raid on behalf and at the request of the United States Secret
Service.  No further information is available at this time, but we'll
pass along anything else we hear about this.


        The 914 and DC raids are very disturbing in light of the fact that
they occurred less than a week after the Pump-Con incident.  What's
going on?  The Newsbytes article featured stated that "the investigation
is continuing".  Are these raids an "Operation Sundevil II"?

The gang and I were walking down St. Mark's Place
This drunk chick was puking
It was such a disgrace!
Later some people were in the very same spot
We yelled, "You're standing in puke!"
They were really shocked
They were slipping on chunks!

Justin went to Tompkins Square Park
He got arrested
It was hell!
He puked all over the cops' holding cell!
They were slipping on chunks!

We went to Roy Rogers
Fried chicken is what we got
When we ate it
We puked all over the parking lot!
We were slipping on chunks!

Jon went to a gay bar
On Christopher Street
When he left
He puked all over this bum's feet
The bum was slipping on chunks!

The cops raided Pump-Con
They busted down the door!
When they interrogated Brian,
He blew chunks all over the floor!
They were slipping on chunks!

Brian wants to go to work for the CIA
The New World Order
Will make him puke every day
He'll be slipping on chunks!

Subject: New Tax Bill Being Debated at 2 a.m. EDT
         October 6, 1992


Just some current events, happening as I write. I'm watching C-SPAN's
coverage of the U.S. House of Reps debate of the "Tax and Urban Aid
Bill." This is basically the main tax code bill.

It's nearly 2 a.m., Eastern time, though only 11 p.m out here in
California (so I'll be able to watch the circus for a few more hours).

What's shocking--but not surprising--is that nearly all the members
getting up to speak are freely admitting they have almost no idea of
what's in the several hundred page bill! This is the last day of the
session, so they're all sitting there at 2 a.m. (and they may still be
there by the time some of you read this Tuesday morning!), getting
increasingly punchy...the better to debate such a bill, I suppose.

We in the U.S. will be living with the consequences of bills like this
for years, bills written by staffers and unseen by our elected
representatives (not that that would make a huge difference!). Some
taxes are being cut, but others are increasing. Riders are attached to
punish some, reward others. (Needless to say, cutting spending in a
serious way is not considered seriously.)

The old saw is that one should never see sausages--or law--being made.
I disagree--watching how this process operates is highly instructive,
if depressing.

(Final update before I sign off: It's after 2, now, and they're barely
making progress. This may go on 'til dawn. And none of them admits to
knowing what's in the bill!)

           A Few Words on the (cough) Election
               by Ground Zero



        November 3rd was indeed a sad night for me.  Bill "Slick Willy"
Clinton was elected.
        I had hoped Bush would make a comeback.  Not that I like Bush.
But almost ANYONE was better than having Slick Willy.  I would have
even rather have Perot as President.
        Slick Willy has a severe credibility problem, in light of his
draft-dodging, lying about extramarital affairs, and other issues.  His
record of Governor of Arkansas is poor, and Arkansas rates in the bottom
five of all the states in many areas.  He plans to work with our
Democrat Congress to push his social engineering, resulting in
$150 billion in new taxes (according to his own figures).  He also plans
to impose a 1.5% payroll tax on businesses to fund a "worker retraining
program", and plans to force businesses to provide health care to
workers - both policies will result in a lot of small businesses folding,
and small businesses provide over 50% of all jobs in the U.S.
        Yet in spite of all that I mentioned above, Slick Willy was
elected.
        Listen up.  Slick Willy's policies will being economic devastation to
the U.S.  He will bring in the P.C. (politically correct) crowd to
D.C.  His administration will break the record in number of scandals
(that's one of my own predictions).
        Also, Slick Willy was "auditioned" by the Bilderbergers, a group
that is part of the shadow world government (the New World Order) in
1991, and it was decided that these powers would back him financially,
and also direct the media to favor his candidacy.  Slick Willy is a member
of the Bilderbergers and also possibly the Trilateral Commission, another
New World Order organization (more on this on our long-upcoming New
World Order article!)
        In the coming issues, we will being you more information on Clinton
that will illustrate just what kind of President we are getting.

        In the meantime, some background info on Clinton..






           "The Clinton of the Past"   by The Pawn


        The Clintons are the ultimate networkers of their generation.  But
what does their "circle of friends" look like?  In crises and private
moments, who will they turn to?
        It was a kitchen cabinet--- literally.  In the summer of 1991, as
he was inching toward running for president, Bill Clinton would convene
informal breakfasts in the kitchen of the Arkansas governor's mansion in
Little Rock.  Seated around the central counter, Clinton and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton,would talk things over with two of their best
friends, Bruce and Bev Lindsey, and a procession of other guests.
At the end of one particulary intense chat, Bruce Lindsey had a question.
"Bill," he asked in mock distress. "What do we do if we win?"
        Everyone laughed.
        Clinton will bring to Washington a new style and set of social
assumptions.  His circle, and his campaign, is full of husband-and-wife
teams like his own and the Lindseys'.  It woud be the first administration to
draw fully on a rising cadre of career women trained for law and politics.
It probably would be the first to include a number of activist gays and
lesbians.  Though it would contain its share of people of wealth, its ethos
would be informal.  Last week Clinton campaign chairman Mickey Kantor--a
high-priced Los Angeles lawyer by trade---was ferried around Washington in a
student's battered Toyota.
        A closer look at the many networks that compose Clinton's World and
the poliitical lessons and people who come with them:
        ARKANSAS-When Clinton's candidacy seemed to be falling apart in New
Hampshire last winter, a group of friends called the Arkansas Travelers took
to their cars and buses and drove north.  They were led by Arkasas Sen. David
Pryor--Whose crisis aid will not be forgotten when it comes to making key
appointments.  They took out newspaper ads with their home phone numers,
urging locals to call for the good word on their hero.  Thousands did.
        Clinton today counts among his closest friends a core of Arkansans
from the buisness and legal worlds.  Besides Lindsey, they include Hillary's
law partners and Jim Blair, counsel to the giant Tyson's Foods.  Perhaps
Clinton's closest friend in the buisness world is Little Rock's Thomas F.
(Mack) McLarty, whom he met at Boys' State and who now runs the powerful
Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co.
        These friends tempered Clinton's early, Naderesque attitude toward
business--and his personal connections to them have sometimes given rise to
conflict-of-interest charges.  Clinton has learned to live cheek by jowl with
a business community that has more clout and cash than most outsiders realize.
Among those who have raised money in million-dollar hunks for his campaign is
Alice Walton, daughter of the late Sam Walton.
        COLLEGE DAYS-Clinton didn't perform the traditional act of political
networking in his home state: attending the University of Arkansas Law School
in Fayetteville.  Instead, he made his earliest Arkansas political contracts
in Washington, as a student at Georgetown.  While working as a student intern
for Sen. William Fulbright, he met Bruce Lindsey, who later became a top aide
to Pryor.
        Clinton was the president of Georgetown's class of 1968; the president
of the class of '67 was Roger Altman, who went on to become rich as an
investment banker.  Altman, now an adviser and important fund raiser for
Clinton, is a leading contender for a top economic post in a Clinton
administration.  As an offical in the Carter administration Treasury
Department, Altman assembled in the private financing of the Chrysler
bailout--a hair-raising government resuce that left him skeptical of using
such "interventions" as a pattern.  "they shouldn't constitue any norm," he
says.
        It is the way of Clinton's world that networks double back and
interweave--often due to Hillary Clinton's own wide circle of contacts.
Altman, for example, reconnected with the Clintons when he served with her
on the board of the Children's Television Workshop in New York.  The epicenter
of Hillary's circle is Wellesley College, where, in 1966, she became the first
student to give a commencement address.  Helping women gain elective office
has been a constant theme ever since.  Hillary and several other members of
the "Wellesley Network" were important early supporters of the National
Women's Political Caucus, says longtime Clinton aide Betsey Wright.  It was
this group, in fact, that persuaded Wright to move to Arkansas in 1982 to
become Bill Cliton's chief of staff.  The Wellesley Network lives:  Hillary's
classmate Janice Piercy recently left her post with the MacArthur Foundation
in Chicago to codirect the Clinton transistion team's talent search.
        YALE-Reich's most important influence was to urge Clinton to join him
in attending Yale Law School, an institution that placed supreme faith in the
ability of law to improve society as a whole, and not merely settle disputes.
The famous credo, recalls Clinton classmate disputes.  The famous credo,
recalls Clinton classmate Nancy Bekavac, was: At Harvard Law, you learn what
the law is; at Yale you learn what it ought to be.  Bill Clinton and Hillary
Rodham arrived at Yale during a time of unprecedented ferment in the law, as
teachers there were studying how to extend the theories of civil-rights law to
women's and children's rights.
        At Yale, Hillary was inspired by an earlier gradute of the school,
Marian Wright Edelman, a civil-rights attorney who would soon found the
Children's Defense Fund.  Edelman, a power in Washington child-welfare
circles, remains one of Clinton's closet friends--and a frequently mentioned
candidate for a post in a Clinton cabinet.  Hillary's legal activism led to
other connections.  As chair of the Legal Services Corp. in the Carter years,
she met Mickey Kantor, a former poverty lawyer who quickly became a close
friend--and one of the first major party insiders to champion Clinton as a
presidential candidate.
        OXFORD-While Clinton's draft maneuvering at Oxford has gotten the ink,
the more important events involved the fellow Rhodes scholars he met there.
"Rhodes scholars," says columnist Michael Kinsley (who was one), "tend to
combine a genuine, naive idealism with a fiar amount of opportunistic
scheming."  Two of the most influential in Clinton's world are Robert B.
Reich, now a prolific author and lecturer at Harvard, and Ira Magaziner, a
buisness consultant based in Providence, R.I. Magaziner gained early fame at
Brown University, where he led a drive for a "new curriculum" that gave
students more choice in courses and room for individual initiative.  He later
tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Rhode Island to turn itself into an
entrepreneurial "greenhouse" with a sweeping program of state money and
regulatory changes.
        Both men are longtime proponents of what Reich calls "public
investment economics."  When George Bush derided Clintonites as a nest of
"European-style social engineers," he meant Reich and Magaziner.  Their growth
strategy relies on redesigning "infrastructure"--everything from railroads to
antitrust laws to worker-retraining programs--to help the country compete in
global markets.  Manipulating the money supply, tax rates or consumer demand
sn't enough, they argue.
        Clinton reads their work carefully, and they return the favor.  When
author David Osborne--a guru of practical "New Paradigm" political
thinking--was looking for governors to profile, Reich urged him to go to
Arkansas.  Osborne's favorable reviews helped him to go to Arkansas.
Osborne's favorable reviews helped establish Clinton with the think-tank and
policy-wonk set.
        The Rhodes network itself continues to be important in Clinton's
world.  One of the most important figures in the campaign is George
Stephanopoulos, a Rhodes scholar from Columbia who is Clinton's unflappable
communications director.  Another is issues director Bruce Reed, from
Princeton.
        THE ANTIWAR CRUSADE-Much has been made about Clinton's protest
activities and travels.  But again, what matters more is the Americans he met
along the way, in England and back in the United States.  One was leftist
writer Derek Shearer, son of an editor at Parade magazine and now
brother-in-law of another close frined at Oxford, journalist (and fellow
Rhodes scholar) Strobe Talbott of Time.  Activist-turned-campaigners provided
Clinton with his first entree into national politics.  At Oxford, he
befriended antoher fellow Rhodes, Rick Stearns, who in turn introduced Clinton
to a wide circle of antiwar activists.  That led Clinton, in 1970, to work in
the Connecticut Senate campaign of Joe Duffey.  Duffey (now the president of
American University in Washington) and his wife, Anne Wexler (a leading
corporate lobbyist), remain close friends of the Clintons--and another pair of
ptential administration figures.  Stearns also found a job for Clinton, in the
McGovern campaign in Texas.  There, in 1972, he first worked with Betsey
Wright.  Ten years later she became his chief of staff in Little Rock.
        By 1974, when he ran unsuccessfully for Congress at the age of 28,
Clinton was able to tap a national network of astonishing breadth.  Though a
political novice, records show that he greatly outspent the Republican
incumbent, John Paul Hammerschimidt.  That network has ramined financially
loyal to this day.
        In this presidential campaign, the antiwar network provided Clinton
with another crucial circle of friends: the gay and lesbian community.  A
clinton ally from those times is David Mixner.  Now a Los Angeles business
consultant and leading gay activist, Mixner has raised more than $3 million
for Clinton.
        RENAISSANCE-Southern progressives established their own informal,
bipartisan vacation retreat in 1981, and it has provided the Clintons with
another network.  Founded by Phil Lader, who at the time was the president of
the Sea Pines Co., the "Renaissance Weekend" brings to Hilton Head each New
Year's a varied group to discuss everything from politics to personal growth.
The Clintons have been attending since 1984.  At one discussion session a few
years ago, Clinton insisted that politicians deserved a "zone of privacy"--and
won substantial applause for what, in effect, was a tryout of the arguments he
would later make in his presidential campaign.
        THE GOVERNORS-Governors of large states regard the National Governors'
association and its subgroups as a Rotary Club for obscure politicians.  But
from his first year as governor, in 1979, Clinton was a model participant,
willing to do the scut work while others talked.  Clinton remains especially
close to progressive governors of smaller Southern state like his own.  One
who is touted as a possible Clinton White House insider is former South
Carolina governor Richard Riley.  He and others fought for improved education,
increased foreign investment and a nondogmatic approach to using government as
an engine of economic growth in low-tax states.  "If you know the history of
the South you know we think education is THE answer," sys Riley.
        Others in Clinton's gubernatorial pantheon include Georgia Gov. Zell
Miller and former governors Jim Blanchard of Michigan, Bruce Babbitt of
Arizona and Ray Mabus of Mississippi.  Any or all of them could end up in a
Clinton administration where management by governors could be a hallmark.  "we
had to learn to do more with less," says Riley, "and that may be a lesson with
the nation needs."
        THE DLC-Once derided by Jesse Jackson as "Democrats for the Leisure
Class," the Democratic Leadership Council became one of Clinton's newest and
most important networks--the last one he assembled before he launched his
campaign.  Founded by centrist Democrats, many of them Southerners upset by
the 1984 Mondale campaign, the DLC knit together like-minded elected
officials.  It also launched a think tank, the Progressive Policy institute,
which has been a spawning ground for many of the New Paradigm ideas--such as
national service in exchange for college loans--that Clinton now champions and
will undoubtedly propose to Congress if he is elected.  The group has
contributed to the Clinton campaign one of its top advisers, political
economist Robert Shapiro.  The DLC served another important function for
Clinton.  It hooked him up with Wall Street and other leading business types,
who became major contributors.
        THE CAMPAIGN-The last circle of friends to fall into place was Bill
Clinton's own campaign.  Tried by fire in the New Hampshire and New York
primaries, campaign aides developed a hit-'em-back-harder style that could
carry over into a Clinton administration--and be troublesome.  Besides the
Lindseys, Wright, Kantor, Stephanopoulos, this new network includes polltaker
Stan Greenberg, media advisers Frank Greer and Mandy Grunwald, campaign
manager David Wilhelm, spin doctors James Carville and Paul Begala,
spokesperson Dee Dee Myers and fund-raiser Rahm Emanuel.
        Until now, the Clintons have been able to assemble their circles
without having to choose among them.  In fact, some barely know the others
exist.  But that will change if the Clintons make it to the Oval Office.
Suddenly all friends will be visible--to each other and the nation.  On social
policy, can the DLC types coexist with, say, gay-rights activists?  In
economics, can his Little Rock business allies live with the "public
investment" engineers?  In the end, Clinton's biggest challenge as president
could be deciding which of the many frineds he's made he's willing to lose.
