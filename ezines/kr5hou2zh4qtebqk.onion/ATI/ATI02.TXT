 Notas Publisaris.

  Two months have slipped by. Prime

Anarchist Productions has moved anudda

state over. We've been invited to the

Young Communist League's annual

convention next week at Amhearst

college. Well, PAP refuses to go NEAR

another college for two whole months.

>From National Student conventions, CIA-

off-campus marches, benefits for

Guatemalans, lectures, divestment sit-

ins, and the usual class attendance,

this entity is about burnt out.

  Besides, they want ten bucks to

"defray costs". That's not my idea of

communism. Plus: I dont think we

should scrap one lousy form of

government for still another lousy

form. I'd much rather work within and

without THIS one.

Actually, he was smarter than you give

hime credit for. First His Party

engineered the decrease in budget,then

when people noticed, the Great

Communucator (SATAN?) restored less

then was cut and came out looking great

  Reagan visited the Coast Guard

promising his full support in their

"war" against drugs.

  Last January, he cut their budget

55%, and there s   another 50% cut in

the making.

By the way:  This is the section for

discussing drugs. Here is the spot for

topics like NORML, a National

Organization for the Reform of

Marijuana Laws, High Times magazine,

and etc.

 Today's hot topic is "Zero tolerance

law". Reagan's most recent pet baby

project.  prime



  Another g00d section is "PHUD",

phreaker's underground development.

Marco,

  Can you call John D and ask him to

call my board?

  Zeshshsh

  (sysnote: to this I had to respond

that I couldn't. There is no way I can

get ahold of John Draper. <I found out

later that his fond# is public

availability-stuff these days. He

called John himself>



  Other things you can see online are

assorted ramblings; Political

discussion amongst all kinds of

different types of dweebs, schtuph

like that. In fact, Infomaniack even

hosts a local warboard where the yokels

can rag on each other and try to jerk

some tears out of their phellow man.



 (sysnote <again> I know that's kind

of violent, but it's the first warboard

New London County has seen since 1986

when the SECCC crew saw the likes of

the Crotch Patrol, Verifier's early

spatramblings, Sue's spellcasting, and

kids a "coffee house" to come chill out

agressively.

Hey all. I just got back from an

enjoyable afternoon in Leister (sp?),

Massachussets with my mom and my

cousin. We picked up Denise, and she

showed us around the campus. I got to

check out the library, (really small),

the police barracks, a 4foot by 9foot

old pump-house, and the dorms. Wow,

what a bunch of foxy freshmen and

sophomore girls.

  At any rate, there was a swap meet

going on in the next town over, held by

the local chapter of Hell's Angels,

and there was a fair going on in the

next town from that held by the

Rotarians.

  I love travelling. Seeing New

England is a really neat thing. In the

towns where my cousin's college is,

there are still those old fashioned

dugout types of things where you wait

for your bus if it's raining. Every

streetcorner had one.  Neat.

Watchin Night Flight. First time I've

seen that since about 1985. Good stuff.

They're doin an expose about the

1960's and how it's about to repeat.



I was talkin to A.H. the other day,

and he was discussing that very

phenomenon.



   "We're repeating the 60's with our

clothes, our music, our poetry, our

rallies. How come we can't start

repeating the political thought too?

That's why I'm bringing back STEAL

THIS BOOK and DANCING THRU THE ICE

AGE. If all goes well, I'll bring back

WOODSTOCK NATION too."

    -a review or two



"Welcome to the Jungle" -guns & roses

  The name reminds me of the old metal

era. Taking something soft; offsetting

it to something extremely hard.

  The song reminds me of the anarchy

to come in this future coming up. Are

they warning us of this summer? The

year of the Dragon? Hmmm. Or are they

just describing their tenement building

before they hit it big. Hmmm. Listen

to the lyrics; close your eyes. Name a

ghetto neighborhood near you-- they're

talkin about it.

  The metal is good, the lyrics are

good, the producing/engineering is

adequate.



"Fast Car" -that black chick with

knotty hair.

  The music was simple, the lyrics

straightforward, the video was

supersimple. The message is clear. Name

your favorite soup kitchen: close your

eyes.   You live there, and want out.

Need wheels?  Tune in MTV.
