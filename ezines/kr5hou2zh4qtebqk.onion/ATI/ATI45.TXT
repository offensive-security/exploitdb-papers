 Hi, welcome to ATI. We'll make this a relatively short one.. In this issue we
 have some miscellaneous things that we're sure you'll enjoy. Read on!

 Now it's time for another great column by Prime Anarchist, The Prime Anarchist
 World News:
 
 Dear Sirs:
 
 Please send me information on your dead seals. I understand you have them
 frozen. I am most interested in the furs and any oils that can be extracted.
 I'll be throwing the rest of them away.
 oops, wrong letter. grettings phellow peploids. Prime, back at you with more
 PAWN. Prime Anarchist World News tonight is brought to you by ATI in
 conjunction with AJAX, Palmolive, and Mr. Clean (as you know, the guy on the
 Mr. Clean bottle is Tom Metzger, white supremacy fascist. He won't be too
 pleased to know that he's helped out with postage here).
      GREAT TRASHING IDEA. read this, and collect 3 accrediteed points towards
 your degree in phreak101. You must be majoring in garbology, or at least
 willing to minor in it. Typing rooms. If there is a typing room in your local
 library, check out their garb cans. They are an excellent source of all kinds
 of info, as many people use these facilities to type up resumes, job
 applications, and loan applications.
      Monica DeGrieff. Remember her? She looks really bad. Dark circles under
 her eyes, all strung out, she looks likeshe's doing a nervous breakdown soon.
 Last month she resigned as mayor of Bogota, Colombia. Probably saved her life.
      Earl Grey tea is very good, if you can find it.
      The White House Press Office is back up. 1-800-424-9090. Reporters call
 it so they can pretend they went to DC and report on Bush. Sometimes comical,
 once in a blue moon, informative, the # is worth your dime (I thought the call
 is phree! -GZ)
      Steal This Dirt-- Members of the Hackberry Hill Brethren Grace Church
 arrived to "la culta" one Sunday morning to find 3 feet of the dirt surroundin
  their church gone.  Who took it? A construction company called Ames. They
 used the dirt to build Interstate 76. The case is still in court. Hey, I say
 if you can get your materials free of charge, why not do it? And what better
 group to liberate it from than a "not-for-profit" organization???
       In Iowa, a payphone call now costs 35 cents!!! Mucho mas than other
 citystates. Some charge 25 cents (New York), yet others are still holding fast
 at 10 cents (Connecticut). You can bet your bottom dollar that each city who
 thinks he can get away with this hike, will follow suit. I say time to repeat
 another good old-fashioned sticker campaign. Use computer mailing labels. Make
 them read something like this:

     LIMA--Peruvians by the thousands are running around with their arms up in
 t air chanting "say yes to democracy!" They're calling it "armed strike".
 Gosh, everyone's up in arms these days.
     "Hang up, I'm going to pound off," says Malcolm Freex.
     "Can I watch?" asks Andrew Oliphant.
     Hehehehe.
     WE'VE GOT BIG BILLS -- Many large-city police stations receive collect
 calls from their informants. If you know the name of an officer you don't
 like, "hello, collect call to officer bob, from pedro, an informant." Do it
 many times and they'll call him in Monday next month and say "you're costing
 us too much $."

     I HATE MALE OPERATORS -- by NRK
     I couldn't read the entire payfone # but wanted to charge some calls to
 it. So I called the 0 operator.
     "Can you tell me what # I'm at? I'm standing at a payfone and wish to get
 a call here."
     "No," she said. "I can't do that."
     I asked her a couple of times then gave up and said "supervisor please."
     "Nope. He'll tell you the same thing."
     "I'll take that chance."
     "Supervisor," said the male voice. "Can I help you?" I told him the scene.
 He suggested that I call 1411.
     "You're kidding me," I said. "How will they know? I'm at one of two miles
 wrth of payfones." He assured me that the 1411 op would be able to.
     "He lied," said a comforting 1411 voice. "Try calling the 0 operator a
 couple of times. Maybe one of them will give it to you."
     I succeeded on my first try.
     "I sure CAN tell you. I apologize for that supervisor," said another 0
 operator.

     Ok, now I feel better after having puked all over my sneakers. That's

 Here's some thoughts on auto insurance:
 
 These are the reasons why car insurance rates are high :
 1. high medical care costs
 2. high auto repair bills
 3. lawsuits
 4. auto theft
 5. fraudulent claims
 6. industry operating costs
 7. urbanization (population)
 8. The mix of vehicles...small cars greater damage usually more expensive.
 
 Facts:     Lawyers get about .52 cents of a dollar on any claim.
            A 12000. car would cost aprox. 40000. to rebuild using parts suppli
            In the past six years medical costs have risen 80%.

 A few words about Canada...
 
           400,000 USE FOOD BANKS TO SURVIVE, STUDY SAYS
 
           Reprinted from the Toronto Star
           Saturday, November 18, 1989, Page A12
 
      Nearly 400,000 Canadians must resort to usig food banks or some
 other charitable food program every month or face starvation, a study
 released yesterday shows.
      One in every 65 Canadians now relies on a food bank or food
 donations just to survive, according to a Canadian Association of Food
 Banks survey of 65 food banks across the country.
      Of these recipients, at least 40 per cent are children, says Barry
 Davidson of the association.
      "This os one of the most shocking numbers," he told the opening
 session of a weekend food bank conference at the University of Western
 Ontario yesterday.  "It means kids are almost twice as (badly) off as
 adults."
      The study, based on statistics for March, 1989, indicates children
 are twice as likely as adults to be fed by food banks.
      In March 1989, the association's official "humber count" was
 378,000 Canadians from 175,000 households, who required food assistance
 about 1.3 times per month.
      Of these, 87 per cent received groceries to prepare at home; 13
 per cent averaged 23 meals per month, the survey found.
      The survey also found the amount of food distributed increased
 significantly from 648 tons in 1988, up to 782 tons in only the first
 10 months of this year.

 This issue we have a small column. It's a possible conversation that possibly
 could have taken place over a car phone:
 (Note: > = male's voice, < = female's voice.)
 
 > Hi baby.
 < Hi, where are you?
 > Right by your house. I'm 5 minutes away. I'll be right over.
 < Huh? I was sleeping.
 > What?
 < I was sleeping. Wait.. did you say you were coming over?
 > Yeah, did you eat?
 < No, and I'm hungry too.
 > Well, we'll go out to a diner and have a nice dinner..
 < (interrupts) No! I have to take a shower. My hair is a mess! I can't go out

 Some of the older cordless phones using the frequencies marked by the <*>
 asterisk are paired with frequencies around 1.7 MHz. Listening to the 1.7 MHz
 side will yield both sides of the conversation.
 The best frequencies to monitor are the 46 MHz as they will repeat both sides
 of the conversation. Power output of both base and hand units are less than
 100 Mw or 1/10 watt so the range is limited. Careful monitoring will produce
 some outstanding results. It is not uncommon to hear conversations up to a
 mile away.

 Wow! This issue turned out to be longer than I thought after all. Anyway, I'll
 leave you with a poem someone shared with the users on my bbs:
 
 He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be
 One against whom there was no official complaint,
 and all the reports on his conduct agree
 That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,
 For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.
 Except for the War till the day he retired
 he worked in a factory and never got fired,
 But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
 Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his view,
 For his Union reports that he paid his dues,
 (Our report on his Union shows it was sound)
 And our Social Psychology workers found
 That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.
 The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day
 And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.
 Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,
 And his Health-card shows he was once in a hospital but left it cured.
 Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare
 He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Installment Plan
 A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.
 Our researchers into Public Opinion are content
 That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;
 When there was peace, he was for peace; when there was war, he went.
 He was married and added five children to the population,
 Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation,
 And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.
 Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:
 Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.
