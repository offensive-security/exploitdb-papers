to ATI34.  Don't mind me, I'm in a bad
mood today.

Anyway, we have lots in store for you
in this issue.  We're going to make
this one a long one, as we've got lots
to say.

But first, a few words on the state of
ATI.  Right now, there are a few BBSs
that regularly receive ATI issues.
But, I can't do all the uploading
myself, so we need a few volunteers to
help distribute ATI.  We would like
ATI to be uploaded to as many boards as
possible, so start sending it to your
local boards, if you feel that they
can handle the fresh, biting, contro-
versial style of ATI (Yes, we have
come across some BBSs that prefer to
censor the views expressed in ATI from
their users! More on this in future
issues..) Also, I am putting up a BBS
in the next few days.  As soon as I
get the software working properly, the
board will be up. Call 201-748-4005,
and if it isn't up when you call, try
again in a day or so. But it should be
up by the time you are reading this.

Also, note this: Tales Gallery's board
is back up. But he lost all the ATI
issues in a disk crash. Also, Audobon
in 703 is down, so don't kall it..
Here are the boards that regularly
receive ATI:

The Pheonix Project      512-441-3088
At-Tel                   812-446-2881
F/X Animation            201-368-0573
Ry-Lor's Den             201-759-2066
Edge of Existence        201-746-9095
Limelight Technologies   203-834-0367
The Red Phone            201-748-4005
   (my BBS! Yay!!)

The list grows regularly, as more and
more people upload ATI to their local
boards. If you are uploading ATI to
any boards, let us know, and I will
publish a more detailed list of boards
that have ATI online in a few weeks.

And also, from now on we will have a
BBS spotlight in just about every
upcoming issue as a regular feature.
We will either feature a BBS, or have
a brief article pertaining to BBSing.
If you know of a BBS you'd like to see
featured, let us know..
  And here we go!!

        about the environment.
         Greenpeace has offices in 17 countries, a fleet of 5 ocean- going
        ships, a river boat (which just completed a tour of the  Great
        Lakes and the Mississippi calling attention to water  pollution
        there) and several sailboats.  Hundreds of Greenpeace  volunteers
        and employees use these tools daily to help protect  the planet.

And now... A rare treat. Ever wish you
could check out some of the many chats
that go on between people in the
phreak/hack world? Well, now we bring
you a chat that we are sure will bring
you chuckles, courtesy of an anonymous
uploader to my board.  To protect the
"innocent", we've edited out names.
hopefully we'll have more of these
chats for your viewing pleasure.
Read on!

ok.. written down... So anyway, need any new members in your group????

Uh, well, knowledgeable ones. I'm not
trying to be a jerk, but you have a lot
to learn.

no prob ... I'll translate that: "Yes,
but not you!!!!!!!!!!!" heh! :) .. I
kinda figured that ... Owell, it was
worth a shot.. heh!

uh, you keep interrupitn me when I  am
typing!  pls stop. anyway, as I was
going to say, we are also looking for
people who are not only knowldegable,
but who have the same ideology as us,
and I do vbelieve that it might be
difficult.  me abnd XXXXX are very
similar in a lot of ways, we think
very much alike..


 owell .. :( .. So.. you have NOTHING
other than your discovery??!?! (I had
an amazing discovery not 2 long ago 2.
 it lasted for a good 3 - 4 months ..
I gave it to XXXX and a local friend
of mine.. no probs.. But when XXXXXXX
 got it, THAT WAS MISTAKE #1 ... He
gave it out too too many people, and
NOBODY but me was allowed 2 give it
out .. And I WAS PISSED TO HELL.. but
hey, 3 months on an alliance, and
worldwide supporting accidental
discovery ain't bad ..


uh huh, and what was this "discovery"?

It was some military base kind of
thing.. their phone system.. it had
extensions and wierd shit.. kind of an
exotic PBX ... It had uh.. 6570 - 6579,
6581 - 6589, 6591 - 6594 were possible
last 4 digit phone #'s of the 800 # ..
when calling the # (which all of 'em
are now disconnected :( ), dialing 20
would give an AT&T dialtone that could
reach out and touch the world .. Then
after they finally caught on to that
(after 2.5 months), I noticed that 9
would also give a 2nd dialtone .. if I
tried 2 dial a 1 + # .. it would give
3 fast dialtones and another normal
dialtone 2 enter a 5 digit code.. but
these people were stupid .. if
i called up, dialed 9, and then instead
of 1 + ac + ph, but instead 0 + ac +
ph, 2 things would happen:

A. I could enter an AT&T calling card
B. Just dial 0, bullshit operator that
my phone is broken and she would dial
   the phone # for me! I used that method pletny!
So did a few friends of mine!
AND .... Most hilarious of all.. when
dialing the 9 for the dialtone, it
could be used as an extender, or it
could reach ALLIANCE without any code
BS!!! Dialing 0-700-456-1000 wouldn't
get you an AT&T calling card tone OR
the operator, so soooo many conferences
were made off of that trick  WE really
did damage to that company phonebill
wise.. But we weren't trying to
purposely do that, we just wanted
conferences ... So I gotta admit,
screwing around with 800 #'s and
KOOK's handle from ddial got me 3
months of heaven!! Now you may type:

how does kook come into play here?

The 800 # had his name in it .. I was
just looking at the ddial, and on my
other line I was dialing #'s with
people's handles.. I was trying for
1-800-456 .. And 56 is KO .. The OK
for KOOK is 65 .. and then I just hit
77 for some unknown reason .. I heard
a dialtone .. And within 10 mins, I
hacked out 21 + 9 for an
outside dialtone .. it wasn't a great
quality tone .. only a few days later
did I realize 20 w/o a 9 after it gave
a clean AT&T line that was almost as
clear as US SPRINT


i see.  you dialed 1-800-456-XXXX from
ur house?


Yeah.. Sometimes thru an extender ..
But I'm not worried.. this was a dumb-
fuck company .. I know it's MCI ..

I thought you said that it was owned
by the military?

It was some military installation shit.
 not the army .. just some office or
some crap.. no big deal.. A really
stupid company .. if they can't figure
out in their phone system that I can
reach alliance, the most expensive
form of calling I make without the
help of the operator or w/o a calling
card, THEY ARE DUMB .. It's too serious
to be careless.. Trust me, they were a
lame company ..

i see..ah well..

so how much GREATER is your discovery
in magnitude? (Mine was pure LUCK)

i am not into head trips.  it doesn't
matter, what matters is that it works
.and is very simple. I discovered
another thing that every 15 yr old
would *kill* to have..actually,
*everyone* would kill to have this
other discovery. the 2nd discovery is
ten times better


Can you tell me ONE of the discovery's?
  I told u mine ... Exactly what I knew
on the system ... Oh.. the system had
one more thing I forgot to mention..
When calling the 800 # and hearing the
initial dial tone, dialing 199 would
give a SPRINT like TONE .. or an MCI
tone, whatever.. I couldn't figure out
how many cdigits the codes were

if I told you, everyone would be beggin
 me for it.  i would never have any
peace!

Well, the only way I can answer that
is "I won't tell ANYBODY AT ALL that I
even have this discovery" .. And if
people somehow manage to find that
much out (which they WON'T cause I
WON'T TELL), I'll never EVER EVER
mention your name .. EVER

sorry  this is my favorite toy. im not
done playing wiyth it yet.  when i get
b0red with it i will give it to you.

Ok.. How 'bout the 2nd discovery? (and
for either or both, can you just answer
me if they are on 800 #'s?)

the 2nd one is my toy. the 1st one, I
need..

ok.. but are they on 800 #'s??

one is, one is not

hmm.. the 2nd one is NOT I take it..
from the way you make it sound.. it
sounds like you figured out a back door
in a local 950 or something ..

perhap, but perhaps not..

well.. no biggie.. I'll wait 4 ya 2 get bored .. heh! :)

hehe. so do you have a new c0de line
up?

Not yet.. haven't checked if my other 2
boxes still work ..

Hmm. hang on a sec.

Both boxes still work ... so I can put
up another codeline at will .. but all
the lamer f*cks who call it don't
leave codes, so what's the point?

i wil get u some stuff to start it and
give the # to /<-rad people

the last time you did that, I had tons
of stuff from you on my line.. what
happened?? People said "Hey, thanx a
lot for the codes! But I don't have
anything now, but I'll get stuff soon
and post it".. a week goes by, 2 weeks
 a month, a year, a decade .. NO CODES
from these lamers.. They're just me,
er uh LEECHES ...


uh, u interrrupted me again,.  that's
annoying, but anyway, i will give the
# to  cool people this time.

sorry for interrupting u.. thought u
were done this time ... Well, I won't
let it out on ddial then if you can
get REAL people 2 call ...


ok, what's the #?

I'll set it up..should I used box 3308
or 3517?

3308..

ok.. 3308 it is then..

ok, what is the dialup?

1-800-877-8896

ok, got it.  hey I gotta split now,
(tired l00k)

ok... no prob.. I'm setting up my
codeline at this moment .. a codeless
codeline .. heh! :)

will post some stuff later..

Ok ... No prob.. and thanx in advance
for the stuff u'll post .. heh!

ok!  take care..

u too.. bye bye

bye!

And here's a bit of info you might find
useful, contributed by my good buddy
THE SNETSMEISTER (203):

                          FRIENDLY INWARDS ????

     Operators can be friendly, if you
say the right words. Dial 0 on a non-
coin fone and say "Hello,this is HOBIC,
would you please connect me to Rate and
Route ?" Rate and Route is an inward
operator for the 716 area code. The
TSPS operator will dial KP716121 no
ama(no charge) and release the call
from his or her console. you can then
ask the operator to dial any number in
the 716 area code and she will think
that you are an operator and you will
take care of the billing. You have just
made a free call to any 716-XXX-XXXX.
REMEMBER TO SOUND LIKE AN OPERATOR,
SAY ASSISTANCE IN DIALING 716-XXX-XXXX
ON A NO RING. AS SOON AS THE FONE IS
RINGING, SHE WILL RELEASE THE CALL
FROM HER CONSOLE AND AS FAR AS THE
OPERATORS ARE CONCERNED, SOMEONE IS
PAYING FOR THE CALL.

        *college-type stuff*


      I was walking about my campus
one morning when a rather disquieting
sight greeted me: An advertisement
from a fraternity seeking pledges
called TKE displaying a 6 ft tall
smiling blonde woman in a very scant
bikini. The text of the ad read:
"Tau Kappa Epsilon" at the top of the
page, and the words "Consider the
Possibilities" were printed next to the
picture of the woman.  How blatantly
sexist.  Naturally, I tore down
the ad, and patrolled the campus in 20
degree weather and tore down any other
copies of the ad I saw. I even saw
another girl tearing down one of the
offending ads, and another female
student wrote a letter to the editor of
the campus newspaper protesting the
ads before I got a chance to.
Also, the director of the Women's
Center wrote a letter stating, "The
offering of a disrobing woman by a
fraternity to its pledges suggest many
possiblities that could involve actions
that women find unwelcome.....In a
social climate that allows people to
tolerate, even accept, violence against
women, it is not only offensive but
also potentially dangerous to women
to present them as objects to be used
by the men who join a particular
organization".
     Right on, ladies!
     Another interesting development:
A new organization has popped up on
my campus. A "New Age" club. Jeez.
It calls itself "The Amethyst Unicorn".
How catchy. A poster advertising the
club lists subjects it deals with:
mysticism, herbalism, crystals, and
even the topic of nuclear disarmament
was listed along with the other
hairbrained items. I wonder.. Would
they use crystals to achieve nuclear
disarmament? Yeah, that's the ticket.
     This reminds me of a line from
a British movie I saw called "Sammy
and Rose Get Laid". Sammy and Rose were
a married couple with a circle of
radical/gay/just-plain-weird friends.
When Sammy's father (who was from
India) visits, a flaky, shallow female
friend of Sammy's asked his father
if he meditates. The old man sighed
and just said, "The world is like a
cultural department store to you
people. You just aimlessly travel to
each floor, taking something from each
floor to satisfy your egos". Sounds
like that this "New Age" junk is all
about. Just totally phony to me.
     But hey.. I'd better not rile
these "New Agers" up too badly. Maybe
they'll cast a spell on me (*gasp*)..

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     * News From the Front.. *

     The Enforcer (502) was busted
along with 2 other teenagers local
to him. The three were busted for
making a total of over $40,000 worth
of fraudulent calls using a local TMC
dialup. The local telco had a trace
of incoming calls to the dialup, and
the outgoing calls on the service were
recorded with a pen register.  FBI
agents visited homes of the three and
confiscated all their computer equip-
ment, disks and notebooks.
      The local TV stations in
Kentucky had a ball reporting this
development, as this was the first of
its kind in that area.  In their
report of the story, they showed note-
books belonging to the three, as well
as some of their disks. The camera
made an emphasis on a disk belonging to
The Enforcer labeled "Fast Hack'Em",
making the viewers think that it was
some diabolical program used for
hacking. Fast Hack'Em is merely a file
copy program for the Commodore! Also,
that TV station is in a lot of trouble,
as one of the notebooks they shown had
the real name of one of the three
teenagers. This is illegal, for all
three are minors, and their real names
are not supposed to be released by
the media. Parents of the teen in
question are considering a lawsuit.
     Skyy King (317) was busted
recently, the main charge against him
being credit card fraud.  He used
credit cards to set up a Phone Base
account, for which MCI is pressing
charges.  He is also being charged with
toll fraud.
     Bill The Cat (317) was busted
for hacking codes on the recently-
abused Rockwell International PBX
(800-247-1028), and also for hacking
codes on his local MCI radius.
     The Arizona Kid (602) and Joe
Friday (918) were busted for toll
fraud as well.  The Arizona Kid was
caught using a variety of LD services
including SouthernNet and Sun,and
faces up to 7 1/2 years of prison.
     A lot of busts out there. Keep
your noses clean. They're out for
blood.
     And here's an interesting thing:
I received a mailing from AT&T asking
me to select their long distance 1+
service, saying that after 60 days
they would reimburse me for the cost
that NJ Bell would charge me for a
PIC change. And I noticed an inter-
esting thing: My name and address was
formatted on their mailing exactly
the same way it appears on my NJ Bell
telephone bill when I get it.  Also,
my telephone number appeared on the
mailing as 201 748 4005 with a 3-digit
code (called the "customer code", used
by NJ Bell only for records) next to
it, also identical to the way it
appears on my phone bill. I wonder
why NJ Bell is providing AT&T with
this information? I thought it was
illegal for them to favor one LD
carrier in its marketing like that. If
it's not illegal, it's at the very
least unethical.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, well, well.  We still have a lot
more stuff for you, but we decided
to release it in the next ATI, as we
don't want to make this one TOO long.

So look for ATI35 in a few days. It
will have my article on Doc
Telecom's and Raider's time in prison,
plus a few other surprises that I'm
sure you'll enjoy.  We have a 2-part
series on voice mail coming up,which
will probably appear in ATI35/36
or 36/37.

But anyway.. Take care, stay out
of trouble, and be creative.  And
we'll leave you with a song:


 (tune: 'safety dance')

 we can hack if we want to,
 we can commit computer crime
 we can transfer money from one
 bank to another on the
 president's private line

 we can phreak if we want to,
 call long-distance all the time
 with access codes and touchtone phones
 we'll never pay a doggone dime!
 we can hack, we can phreak
 hackers are taking control
 we can hack, we can phreak,
 phreaking from a telephone pole

 ma bell will try to trace us,
 but we'll stay one step ahead
 but don't call too much or
 you'll run out of luck
 and get busted by the feds!

 we can crack if we want to,
 getting wares before they're out,
 posting them on local ae lines,
 and every bbs in town

 we can hack, we can phreak
 hackers are taking control
 we can hack, we can phreak,
 phreaking from a telephone pole


       keep on hacking!
