Taken from The National Enquirer, June 11, 1985 edition, p.28

'BEWARE- Computer Crooks Can Phone Long Distance - At Your Expense'

  Watch out! Crooks are using computers to steal long-distance phone service
code numbers- and if you use a long-distance service, check your phone bills
carefully.
  "It's absolutely frightening," declared John Maxfield, an expert who works
for private industry tracking down computerized thieves.
  There are millions of Americans who subscribe to long-distance phone
services- such as Sprint, MCI, Teltec for Transcall America.
  Subscribers are given a personal code number, which they dial to gain
access to the computer that makes the long-distance calls.
  An ENQUIRER investigation has turned up some shocking examples of what can
happen when a crook discovers your long-distance code number:
  o A New York woman was stunned to open her phone bill and find it
totalled $175,000. Her access number had been traded among several thieves.
  o Prisoners at Atlanta's Fulton County Jail bought someone's Transcall
America number- and ran up a whopping bill of more than $12,000 before they
were discovered.
  o A Florida woman received a $175 phone bill listing dozens of long-
distance calls- and after protesting, she learned that her Teltec number
had been stolen and sold to a jail inmate.
  Many thieves discover valid long-distance codes by programming their
computers to find sets of numbers that work, explained Donn Parker, an
expert on computerized crooks who works for a California research and
consulting firm.
  "A kid can turn on his computer before he goes to school in the morning
and run it all day long.
  "He comes home- and there on the printer is a list of valid numbers that
the computer has turned out."
  Incredibly, it's practically impossible to stop these thieves, the
experts agree- and about the only way you can protect yourself is to go
over your phone bills with a fine-tooth comb.
  "The customer should report any suspicions they have," said Joe Rudd,
former security chief for Transcall America.
  "Otherwise you may end up holding the bag on a big phone bill, because in
many states, a telephone company is not responsible after 30 days.
  "If we establish that a code has been stolen and calls made by a crook,
we'll give the customer credit."
                      -David Wright

Discussion Questions:
 1) Has anyone ever heard of Transcall America? Or how about Teltec?
 2) Why does the Enquirer rely on the words "Expert","crook" and "thieves"
so much?
 3) Since when do inmates use access codes?
 4) Have you ever "Turned on your computer in the morning" and run it all
day long?
 5) Why do they ask the FORMER security chief of Transcall America? (I'll
answer that one, nobody else wanted to talk to them!)
 6) How the fuck could anybody ever run up $175,000 phone bill in a 30 day
billing period?
 7) Do you 'program' your computer to find 'sets' of numbers? I personally
just type "BRUN CAT HACKER 3.71"

Recommendations:
 1) Hack Transcall America and Teltec. Since nobody has ever heard of them,
they will be poor and they can't afford a tracing system.
 2) Assume that all ENQUIRER sources are a little 4'2" old lady in the
corner
of their office building.
 3) Enquirer investigations are trash.
 4) the Enquirer is trash.
 5) They should be sued for telling the entire reading population how to
hack numbers.

Watching CNN on Friday I noticed that they somehow decieded this national
UNIX virus was the work of the hackers (shudder,gasp).  Wonder if they gave
a
second thought to pointing fingers after they found out it was some "bored
grad student" that released it?

 Whenever the slightest little thing happens involving computer security,
or the breach thereof, the media goes fucking bat shit and points all their
fingers at us 'nasty hackers'.
 They're so damned ignorant it's sick. And that radio show.  That guy was a
fucking moronic fool.  How dare he make  stereotypes of hackers, and say
we're all a bunch of geeks who lack physical and social exposure because
we're always in our rooms.  Fine, if he wants to play with stereotypes, we
can just say that he's a bored, middle-aged, undersexed pervert who
watches porno flicks while his fat wife is asleep, and takes out his
sexual aggression on children.  It's so amazing.  And they wonder why
certain individuals resort to pulling their credit and harassing the shit
out of them.  They deserve it.

Two days ago I was on CIS. There while in one of the band.I saw this alias
Mr. Hacker(USA)...I couldn't resist but to ask him "Why the handle like
that" And basically we started talking about all and how it start.Then we
proceeded on to boards.He told me that he was a part of sherwood forest 2,3.
But refused to tell me his real handle. Anyway some jerk out of nowhere
while we were talking about systems intereptedus and started giving us the
third degree.I tried to as much as I could to tell him that Hackers were
actaully not bad people but are only trying to educate themselves.He was
not even ready to listen our side of the story, but said that Hackers were
just a bunch of nonsense people trying to reck systems etc.This really got
me PISSED off.And soon I was getting in the mood for the offensive side.
But later on as the conversation proceed (Negatively) three other people
got into it.They were completly opposed to us.I could feel it that we were
out numbered but we still stood but their ignorance never allowed them to
understand what we were trying to say. So we just decided to bag it and let
the jerks say what they want and decided to go (/TALK). Mr. Hacker(USA)
turned out be quite knowledgeable and new alot about Computer Security
and also inside out about DMS100. Never knew who this person was.Anybody
have a clue?

Anyway what I am also trying to say is that SAVANT hackers who go around
destroying systems they Hack is totaly pathetic and has given a bad
name to the so called "Educational Hackers"..and basically there no way to
stop these pigs.

As stated in the above posts whenever the media happens upon anything that
invloves malicious computer use its the "HACKERS".  The word is a catch
phrase it makes mom drop the dishes and watch the TV. They use the word
becuase not only they don't really know the meaning but they have lack of
a word to describe the perpatrator.  Thats why hacker has such a bad name,
its always associated with evil things and such. Well I thik I agree with
Arcane Heirophant it is a nice evil word
to describe ourselves.

I never seen a phreaker called a phreaker when caught and he's printed
in the newspaper. You always see them "Hacker caught in telephone fraud".
"Hacker defrauds old man with phone calling card".. What someone should do
is tell the fucken media to get it straight.

Certain security publications use the term "Computer Phreak" to indicate a
person who "penetrates" computer systems.  Their reasoning is that
Hacker means a knowledgible computer user, and doesn't imply illegal usage,
while a phreak is someone who illegaly uses the phone system. (sic).
Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit, and why not use the term
"hacker", it does have a nice sinister ring to it.

     I dont think you seem to notice half of the misconceptions being taken
out on the 'Electronic Underground'.. I read in a paper last year about a
man who sold children and made a diary about the sexual encounters he had
with the children and put it on disk...  Got busted, and the headline,
NO SHIT, was : 'Child Pervert Hacker Arrested in Florida case'...

   If people would try to clear up the misconceptions with some of these
officials, possibly our name wouldn't get thrown around so much...

That enormous misconception was used by one particularly ambitious
politician as a vote-grabber a few years back. He wanted to place BBS's
under _very_strict_ federal control to prevent pedophiles from keeping
on-line databases of easy victims. Ridiculous, but many people bought that
bullshit.  By the way, good old John Maxfield of Boardscan, Inc., was once
arrested (and convicted!) of child molestion.

Well, this is a first... in addition to scads of security personel, we now
have someone's Mom on...  Actually, that worries me more than anything...
all I need is for some parent to freak out and begin a massive campaign to
get me in trouble.
Anyway, I gave her access.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm holding my breath...
let's hope her offspring has enough sense not to try and make TNT in the
kitchen or any of the other boneheaded things that some of the early Phracks
recommended doing...
