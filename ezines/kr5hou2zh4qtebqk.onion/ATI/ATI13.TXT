FILM SEIZED IN SOUTH AFRICA
(PAP) JOHANNESBURG, SA--Police
Tuesday ordered the seizure
of video cassette-recordings of
the anti-apartheid film
"Cry Freedom", which was banned from
cinemas two months ago.
  Police said local distributors had
inquired about selling the video
cassettes and that illegal or "pirate"
copies of the film already were being
circulated in South Africa. "Cry
Freedom" tells the story of South
African activist Steve Biko, who died
while in police detention in 1977, and
Donald Woods, a white newspaper editor
who befriended Biko.

Watchin Night Flight. First time I'Ve
seen that since about 1985. Good
stuff. They're doin an expose about
the 60's and how it's about to repeat.
I was talkin to AH the other day, and
he was discussing that very phenomenon.
  "We're repeating the 60's with out
clothes, our music, our poetry, our
rallies. How come we cant start
repeating the political thought too?
That's why I'm bringing back Steal
This Book, and Dancing Thru the Ice Age
If all goes well, I'll bring back
Woodstock Nation too.

Tom Clancy's THE CARDINAL OF THE
KREMLIN and Lawrence Sanders' TIMOTHY'S
GAME could make you late for work if
you listened while getting ready in the
morning: The first is a thickly plotted
fast-paced espionage yarn that pits
Clancy's CIA hero, Jack Ryan, against
the KGB; and the second features Wall
Street private eye Timothy Cone in
three tales of murder, blackmail and
other dirty tricks. S&S 14.95.

(APWN)Storrs, CONN--
We now bring you a transcript from
Governor Mario Cuomo's roadtrip
speeches. (he gets out whenever he
can) we take you to the middle of
a UConn address where he makes fun of
Reagan, Yale, Lee Iacocca, etc., and
he gives us his wish that this year
we set some kind of vision for
America. PAP strongly recommends you
pay the 3/5/9 bucks to see him if
he's scheduled to speak at your local
college, RTM, or Bah Mitsvah.

"Aids. 1 out of every 700 children
being born in the city of NY, has
aids. Born to die.
  In 6 years they'll be dead. And you
have to keep em alive until then.
Who's gonna pay the bills?
  We're keeping them alive, but we
have nothing for them at the end of
the line. We cant afford beds, we
cant afford the hospitals, we cant
afford the care; and you talk to me
about peace and prosperity.
  You're telling me we are at peace,
and people are being killed savagely
in the streets of our own country.
 By gangs, by drugs; and you say
we're at peace. Forget about the rest
of the world. How can you say we're
at peace here when the jail cells in
New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey
and everywhere else are bursting, you
say we have prosperity.
  We have more poor than ever before.
21st century's 12 years away, you can
reach out and touch it; it's so close.
21st century's here. The work force of
the 21st century's gonna be black,
hispanic, women, and disabled; black,
hispanic, women, and disabled; black,
hispanic, women, and disabled. The most
vulnerable population we have.
  The drop out rates are fierce. You
dont care; you're not black; you're not
hispanic. You didnt drop out. Your
sister didnt drop out.
  You better care. That's YOUR
workforce. If they're not here to work
in the 21st century, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE IT. Because this country will not
be able to compete with the rest of
the world.
  And you know what happens when they
drop out? A 15 year old girl? Drops
out in the inner city area? Where does
she go? She-does-not-go-to-the-convent.
  She goes to her body. Where does the
14 year old boy go? he goes to the
street. He sells crack. He gets in the
business. He's a lookout for
cokedealers. He gets 400$ an hour just
for playing what we used to call in
the old neighborhood chickie. Just for
being a lookout. And he winds up in
jail, and he winds up an addict.
  And you're telling me, that the
status quo is good enough??? I CANNOT
say the economy is strong. I cannot
accept that. Now look: you dont have
to have a warden's degree to see
you're being lied to.
  It took 200 years to pile up a
trillion dollar debt. ok? Then we
had a conservative government for 8
years. In less than 8 years they add
another ONE POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS
IN DEBT. They nearly tripled it!!!
  You're borrowing money from the
Japanese, the Germans, the rest of the
world. And every year you pay them
interest. 155 billion dollars a year in
interest. You dont have enough money
for college loans, homeless people,
aids, research, roads and bridges are
falling. You "cant afford" health
insurance. Free college, you cant
afford it. Spleens, organs, you cant
afford it. Yet you pay 155 billion
dollars a year in interest.
  Is that prosperity? Is that good
enough for you? Of course not. 155
billion; and it happened in 7 years.
  I'd love to see Michael Jackson
making videos telling the kids to
not use drugs. The one thing I resent
the most about our "war on drugs" is
denying that it is complex.
  Cuomo then recommended a few good
books for the college aged "kids" to
keep up on; and stressed economic
relations with Japan. He also stressed
that we need Africa as they are goin
to be a very powerful 3rd world
alliance when it comes to econ. He
all-in-all gave us a vision for our
country.
  Let's get out there and form a
more perfect union. kick ass.

  In other news, Ground Zero is here.
She'll be here for 3 days or so.
  Her title these days, is Associate

That'll change in a matter of minutes.
And if she gets around to it, she might
honor us by typing in an excerpt or two
from "Screw unto Others" or "How to Get

(special pap stuff)--
Is "let them eat cake" day coming up?
I saw Dairy Queen is runnin a promo
called that. Come to think of it, I
 d o   remember it being sometime
around Columbos day. For those of you
just tuning in, some queen in olde times got snagged. Someone overheard
her speaking about the poor
impoverished (redundancy used on
purpose, because) peasants. when asked
what she planned regarding her lower
class; she quoth, "let them eat cake".
  Colleges often times use this every
year to get political thought rolling
by having a bake sale in her name. I
remember it being fall, Sept/Octoberish
but I cant put my finger on the exact
date. Oh well. I'll've to ask someone.

RADIOWATCH!!! a  p a p
                / / / exclusive
The local radio station was playin
some serious disco tonite. After about
11 minutes, (all I could take, really)
I switched over to the commercial
stations but found myself back to CNI.
  It was tolerable I guess. Hey at
least I hadn't heard the same songs
"over and over and over". No matter
how different the stuff is, at least
it's a refreshing change as opposed
to the week's top 20 played over and
over and over. I come from an old metal background.
  You know,,, Purple, Zeppelin,
Aerosmith, Cult, Sabbath, etc. This
new stuff is for the birds. But I'll
listen to anything once or twice.
That's the new wave side to me, I
guess. Opens me for different
cultures, modes, genres. As long as
you don't play 8 O'clock's song at
12 O'clock and then again at 4, only
to repeat it again at 8.
  Do that and I tune your station
out!!!

-=-=>BIRD TYPE STUFF<=-=-
(APWN)-TENN--Danny Quayle was
telling Chattanooga community
college that America was
gonna be on top.
  "We're going to be the envy of the
World", said the chap.
  With his southern accent, I thought
for sure I heard "end of the world".
  Had to play it back on my TV a 3rd
time before I reproved to myself that
he wasnt assuring armageddon.

NO JACK KENNEDY
  How the hell can a redneck hick
from Indiana running on a
conservative ticket that makes
McCarthy look wimpy even THINK we're
gonna see him as the next JFK???
  Adolf hitler, maybe; but JFK???
  No.

(APWN)Philadelphia--ABBIE HOFFMAN ON
ACTIVISM: The Philly electric company
is upset with me because I'm not just
blowin windmills. They know I'm one
fuck of an organizer. And I'm
willing to risk everything.
Everything.
  That's the mentality you've gotta
develop. Not who you gonna vote for.
You've gotta say, how do we get block
booking now, or how do we get the
cars together, what points are we
gonna raise, are we just gonna go
there to bullshit to argue that
local organizings more important or
we need a black woman lesbian
leader the first time who's against
a vegitarian cabbage kid supporting
arms struggle; is that what you're
gonna do? Stay home.
  Do I think the press should be
allowed to say we're at war right
now? Think about 1 million Indians
in Guatemala killed or driven out
of their homes.

WELL THAT'S IT FOR ATI 13. THE
Special 13 colonies issue. Hope you
