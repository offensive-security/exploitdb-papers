First up, it's Prime Anarchist with the Prime Anarchist World News (PAWN):

p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n*p*a*w*n

    Hola, Prime here again; bringing you PAWN.  I'm more than happy that ATI
will be the exclusive carrier of this fine piece.  Which means y'all can rest
assured; I'm not selling out and going syndicated.  OK, here's the breakdown
of information as I see it this week. If we're not gonna negotiate with
terrorists, how come we're chatting so favorably with Iran???  Are we
portraying them suddenly not as terrorists? How stupid does the Bush
Aggravation, er, uh, I mean administration think wepeople are?  And to
suddenly take a "no neg" policy after 2 weeks of heavy negotiations with
Lebanon is pure bunk.  Not only are we the people being seen as stupid, but
George's advisores are no doubt playing HIM the fool.
   When driving, close one eye when cars pass at night (especially on high
beams) to protect your night vision.  This works a lot better than the
standard method of trying to stare at the side of the road.  Helps you see
much better in the dark.  
   Once in a while, don't use any detergent with your laundry.  Just stick
it in there and start the spin cycles going.  There's enough soap left over
from the last person, and your clothes'll look better longer.
   Remember,if you can't be radical for a just cause,then be rad just because.
   With the 20th anniversary of Woodstock happening, self-proclaimed experts
are having fashion shows on Good Morning Amerika and speaking out on talk
shows as well as the evening news.  Warning:  most of these so-called experts,
50-55 year olds, weren't ever involved in the 60's.  They now feel bad,
and are reliving their childhood by being some sort of yuppy yipster.
A strange and very scarey phenomena.  I was about 4 years old back in the
Woodstock weeks and I'm thinking I remember it better than these thugs. 
It's sad.  I think we might've totally lost or defaced-by-rewrite a whole
historical genre. Misinformation sucks.
   How come you can see invisible tape?
   When someone says "you got a minute?",pack a lunch and maybe a sleepingbag.
   Jackie Martling added seven new numbers to his 516-922-wine system.
922-9571, 9572, 9573, 9574, 9458, 9455, 9449. For a good time, pick a number.
Any number.
    A fone rings at 570hz, can be seized at 2250, and can be released at 2600.
 But good luck doing it from home.  Most reigions are now set up so the
whole loop won't respond no matter how loudly you blast your single-tones.
You've basically gotta run a tie-line out of your local switch. Good luck
there.
    "Hmmm.  What's that wire going from Marion's TSPS over to Mr. Ed's house?"
    "Dunno, must be authorized."
    Expanding your tone chip?  1633hz is a nice one to add.  Played next to
a1 you have "FO" and with 2 you've got "F", and as 7 you get "I" and at the
0 slot you have "R", "C" and "P".    More on that later. 
    VCR's are selling in Britain with built-in software to receive and
transmit teletext.  The company to bug for info is Grundig.  I found them
quite helpful.  For a world power, we sure are behind on a lot of things.
Heck, we can't even decide if we want to combine TV's and VCR's, or try
outDAT, or improve our pathetically archaic public transportation system.
    Dark Ages? 
    I just sat patiently thru a 6,000 word Associated Press article where
the entire content seemed to be nothing more than the Credit Card bougioux,
er, uh, I mean buisness world blaming 91 million a year credit card fraud
for their refusal to bring their rates down. I'm sick and tired of these
megabucks bastards claiming that fraud is keeping their interest rates high.
If a bank certificate can only get you 9% on your dollars, Citicorpse et al
damned well can drop down to at the least,10 percent!!!!  With or without a
percentage of fraud, as marginal as it is,a 20% credit card is highway
robbery.
    "We want you to succeed, not just survive."  More like "because we want
you to owe, not grow."
    65 million dollars to Bogota, Columbia.  Whew!  That's a lot of money
for dope.  Expect pot and coke to saor as this "war on drugz" heightens.
And, keep in mind.  It's nothing nore than a witch-hunt.  Keep a good rep,
and it'll be smooth sailing 4 U.
    Madame Helmsley got off easy.  Figures.  Rich people can kill and get
off.  (They may get off by killing, but they still go to jail--ed.)  They
got her on some of the medium and small counts.  She COULD get 5 years jail.
But keep in mind.  With all the stuff she did (see "empire" in the mafia
dictionary; punk and wagoners) she oughta hang, or at least get life. (Perhaps
Mr. Anarchist should look up "empire" in a real dictionary--ed.)
    Jim Bakker?  Must be nice to spend $30,000 a day on attornies.  How's
this for one?  They apparently found the mega-fraud/conspiracy type guy
under a desk in his friend's office hiding from all the people out to get
him.  He was hallucinating.  (Televangelists don't hallucinate; they
seeeeeeee!)  You watch.  He'll spend about five months in a funny farm, and
then get pronounced "better" (Not quite, eh?--ed.).  Must be nice to get off
scot free.  Meanwhile, a casual pinjoint smoker can expect life.
   Tired of taking peoples' bull?  Give them a little of their own.  100%
steer manure in a clear bag tied up neatly with a leather strap, and the
message of your choice for $9.95 (now THERE's maturity--ed.).  Call
1-800-543-5300 to use a MC or Visa, or send check or money order to For-Tuna
Enterprises, PO Box 30506-c, Long Beach, CA, 90853.  I called the number
and someone answered, but I didn't take it any further.  Post results.  OK? 
    Hey The Unbeliever:  If I WERE able to travel the speed of light,
halogens would be useless.  What would you suggest I use?
    Hey Mac (213):  I called you on the Red Phone, but the line was busy all
night, so I'll address your topic here.  Flags:  Hmm.  What's our flag
represent?  Much like a gang, our nation has Colors.  Colors represents the
men and women who died for our freedom.  We should have great reverence for
Colors.  (At least he has one redeeming value--ed.)  Colors stand for those
that died in the two world wars to uphold freedom or simply follow orders.
Colors also stand for those who died in wrong wars like Nam, or Honduras.
Color should be respected with your life, I respect it with mine every day
I take a breath of free (last time I checked) fresh (well) air.    But.... 
He who pushes to pass a full-fledged Constitutional amendment should be
SHOT!!  Pure bunk, I say.  What we need least is legislation.  What we need
more, is to bring up our children morally, to respect Colors.  That's all it
takes.  It worked for some 200-odd years(except of course for you people,who
started all this flag-burning crap--ed.)  Why can't it work under a Bush
administration?  (Ask yourself that the next time you light up a
"pinjoint"--ed.)
    And finally, lets look at this admin a bit.  Using abortion as the issue
to test; we have "pass legislation.  restrain.  restrain."  The last thing
our countryfolk need is mroe laws restraining us.  Bush, you're blowing it.
What we do NOT need is a law restraining abortions.  Only the poor will
obey it anyways.  What we DO need is education, morals, openness.  Teach
our children well, and they will require less restraints.  (On the other
hand,look what all our education did for animals like you--ed.)
    (PAWN)--CRIPPLE CREEK.  The Eulogizer From Hell; Doc Gonzo Remembers AH.
On the road this past year, Hunter S. Thompson has been often asked to
eulogize media star, Abbie Hoffman.  One of Hunter's abiding memories of
Abbie is that he paid his bets.  "I watched a basketball game with him in
Seattle a while back.  He considered himself a great handicapper, but I beat
him on a bet and he paid," recalls Hunter.  "That's not bad."
    That's better than you can say for Peter Rose.  This morning, standing
right on Pete Rose Way, in Downtown Cincinatti, Mr. Rose tried to reason
his latest statement that got him a "slight" punishment by the baseball
commission.
    "I wanted it to read, 'I don't confirm or deny having bet on baseball',
they wanted it to read 'this finding neither confirms nor denies Rose's
betting on baseball'.  We compromised, and it now reads, 'This finding
neither confirms nor denies Rose's betting on baseball'.  Way to go, Pete.
By the way, Pete, if you're reading this, Hunter Thompson wants his thirty
bucks.
     In 1970 a county commissioner was elected by ONE VOTE.  The loser
demanded a recount, naturally, but the original tally proved correct. 
So, in Hinsdale county where voting residents still number only about 200--
everyone takes his politics mighty mighty seriously.
    This sign found in a local library:  "Do not place small children and
large objects on counter".  A woman put her daughter upon the counter
and the checkout asked her to place the infant on a chair or the floor. 
An argument started over the fact that "since I only have a small child and
not a large object AS WELL, I should be allowed to place her here."  They
then changed the "and" to an "or" and the sign now reads "Please do not place
small children OR large objects..."
    Can you believe 1989 is almost over???  Sept. already.  October's almost
here.  Soccer season.  time to go running the miles again.  Good luck sports
fans.  It's gonna be a good sports year.  You can bet on it.
     Happy 43rd birthday, Connie Chung, you ornery old bat.  if you ever,
ever, push ME out of the way at a press conference to scoop me on a single
interview question; while the other guys are up on their elbows with their
mouths wide open thinking "I don't believe she did that to me" while 23,000
Americans are tuning in, while you're flitting your hair back in place to
prepare your calm relaxed lady-like interview, I'm gonna get back up off
the ground and punch you right in the mouth.  Right on national TV!!!!
     Why do they call it defacing property when you're writing something ON
it? If you chisel words OFF of a gravestone, say, I can see that as defacing;
but writing ON something?  They'd better pick a new word 'cause they're wrong.
Just thought I'd bring that up.
     Bocce has got to be about the most difficult sport to learn just by
watching.  I have no idea what the object is.  I could probably spy all day
too, to no avail.
     Arcades are starting to offer a form of credit or debit card.  You
insert the card in some thingie and you put money into some slot.  The thing
then gives your card the appropriate amount of credits.  Neat.  A lot can be
done with that.  You could set it so random cards get free credits (like a
red receipt special at the grocery store) Hmm.  All kinds of ideas come to
mind. Instead of a "match", the machine'd ask you to insert your card again
Or continue playing.  You'd get a credit for ANY machine if you want it.
Nice technology.
     With all the Colombian drug busts coming our way, I wonder how we're
keeping Manuel Noriega quiet.  Something's definitely awry in Denmark.
Last time anything like this schtuff came up, Noriega threatened to blab all
about how Bush was way up in the Medellin theatre.
     If you even have blue nachos laced with smashed-to-a-liquid jalepeneos,
and hot tea, along with french onion soup, order lots of ice water.
In fact,if you plan ahead, you can have a garden hose installed next to your
table. Eat the soup first, belive me.  If you try it after the jalapenachos,
you're in for a narly surprise.  The tea can be drunk any time in the meal.
As cold as it gets, you could even drink it later tonite, and you'll still
think it's your basic hot orange and black pekoe.  It's worth the struggle,
though.  Blue nachos are delicious.  When you finally finish, you'll feel
fulfilled, even if it IS like eating mako shark (while he's still alive).
     If you must smoke, smoke Pall Malls (no filter to pollute with).  Or you
COULD roll your own.
     Cellular One is the competitor of the US West.  They've got a van
loaded up with 3 carfones that you can use for "free local calls".  I thought
that was a catchy ad. They go wherever there might be a lot of people.  I
wonder if all the companies use this approach yet, or is this one guy's
project so far.  I wonder how well it actually is doing, though?
     I don't much like 12 strings, how 'bout you?  They sound sweet and
all, but I never enjoyed playing them.  Too limited.  I'll take a beat up
old folk guitar any day.
     Did I hear the radio right?  Were they talking about Palestinians or
Palace Indians????  They better speak up!!!
     90% of people who seek drug rehab in America are turned away because
of space/resource/personell problems.    Hmm.  NORML claims that paper made
from hemp is 80% safer for the environment than that made from tree pulp.
     Waddya make of all these percentages?  Hmmm.  90 drugz, 80 hemp.  I'd
say if 85% of druggies would just light up a joint instead of trying to go
to drug rehab, there'd be a whole lot more paper left for the rest of us.
     Anarchy in gas stations- wondering what to do with that old keychain
in your junk drawer?  Put each key in one of those dealership "earlybird"
envelopes with a made-up name and address on the front.  Then slip each one
in the slot.  They'll spend hours looking for "your" car in the their lot.
Then they'll spend days trying to find "you" before they realize it's a
joke.
     "Will work for food" says a sign held by a guy with a heavy beard growth
on a local street corner here.  I'd say things aren't getting much better
these days.  The warnings GOP gave us if Democrats got in office are happening
anyways.  (Maybe because they control both houses of Congress?--ed) Hmm.
And maybe worse so than if they HAD gotten in.  Remember "a vote for Duke is
a vote for taxes"?  Hmmm.  What's the first thing King George the 43rd did to
us?  Hmm.  The gallon of gas as gone all the way back down to 60 cents where
it belongs, huh?  Hmmm.  And look how better we are at handling hostage
situations and terrorism the world round than a Carter type person would've
been?
     I think it's time for cutting thru the bullshit.  No politician is a
good politician.  Nobody can make order of this mess we call a democracy.
Nobody comes through on all of his campaign promises.  Nobody doesn't just
shake your hand and kiss your baby.  Nobody can run a nation effectively.
     I say Nobody for president!  Thank you for reading once again, PAWN.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And now, from the "This Could Happen to YOU!!" department, here's a look at
how someone was tracked down and busted for phreaking.  To protect the
identity of the person in question, the name of the person, address, city,
state and the long distance company involved have been blocked out.
The long distance co. investigator involved in the case will be referred to 
as "Smith".

THE STATE OF XXXXXXXXXXX                               AFFIDAVIT FOR

COUNTY OF XXXXXXXXXX                                   SEARCH WARRANT

Your affaint,  XXXXXXXXXXXX, a peace officer employed by the XXXXXXXXXX
County District Attorney's Office,  after being duly sworn, on oath
makers the following statements and accusations:


                                 I.


There is in -CITY-, XXXXXXXX County, -STATE-, a place and premises
described as a single family residence located at -ADDRESS-


                                II.


There is at the said place and premises, impliments or instruments
used in the commission of a crime described as switch accessing
devices such as personal computers and connecting equipment, like
automatic dialers, programs, recording devices, discs, modems,
printers,  telephones,  hardware and software that were used or
adapted to access computers owned by -COMPANY- and property or items
constituting evidence of an offense or constituting evidence
to show that a particular person committed an offense such
as the above cited items and notes, records, printouts, and ledgers.


                                 III.


The said premises and place is controlled by -DEFENDANT-.


                                 IV.


It is the belief of your affaint, and he hereby charges, accuse and
says that he has reason to believe and does believe that -DEFENDANT-
or someone living at the place and premises noted above, in
-CITY-, XXXXXXXXX County, -STATE-, on or about between --DATE--1989,
gained access to data stored and maintained by a computer owned by
-COMPANY-, without the effective consent of -COMPANY-, the owner of the data,
and the caller knew there existed a computer security system
intended to prevent gaining access to the data in violation of the
"Breach Of Computer Security" statute of the -STATE- Penal Code and
stole -COMPANY- credit cards in the process in violation of the "Credit
Card Abuse" statute of the -STATE- Penal Code.  In addition it is
your affaint's belief that the person who gained access to the
data, violated the "Unlawful Use Of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" statute
of the -STATE- Penal Code. He committed this crime by adapting
programs and computers with the intent to make phone calls so as
to illegally obtain the data in question and that those phone calls
were in fact made on or about between --DATE--, 1989 and --DATE--, 1989
and the person knew the character of the instrument he set up.
In addition, he has reason to believe and does believe that person
or persons in the place and premises in question made numerous long
distance phone calls between --DATE--, 1989 and --DATE--, 1989 using
-COMPANY- credit cards that were stolen in the process described above
in violation of the "Credit Card Abuse" statute of the -STATE- Penal
Code. He further believes that the above cited items, property,
impliments and instruments are located at the place and premises
cited above.


                                 V.


Your affaint's belief is based on two things--his personal
experience that he has garnered through executing numerous search
warrants in cases like this and conversation he has had with Smith
who is employed as Director Of Security for -COMPANY- and a person
with no known criminal record.

Your affaint, for approximately 16 months, has been in periodic contact
contact with different members of the security divisions of various
long distance communications common carriers (phone companies).
I have worked primarily with Smith of -COMPANY-.

Smith and other security personnel have filed numerous complaints
alleging that persons are accessing their companys' computer
systems and obtaining data from them. The persons or "hackers" or
"phreakers" as they are known in the industry, have learned how to
break into and use the computers employed by the various companies
to make long distance phone calls without having to pay for the
service.

On dozens of occasions, I have executed search warrants on
residences and businesses identified through "trap and trace"
information supplied by various phone companies pursuant to the
filed complaints and in almost 100% of the searches recovered
computers and equipment such as automatic dialers, programs,
recording devices, discs, modems, printers, telephones, hardware
and software as well as notes, records, printouts, and ledgers which
indicate that a person was in fact making calls to the phone
company systems, and obtaining data (codes which authorize long
distance calls) like the complaints had alledged. This property,
items and other material, is invariably found at the place and
premises that are identified in the "trap and trace". I have found
that the property, items and other materials are kept for months
and sometimes years so that they can be used again and referred
back to.

On -DATE-, 1989, Smith told me that he was investigating an
individual that was making calls into -COMPANY-'s system from -CITY-,
XXXXXXXX County, -STATE-, obtaining long distance telephone
authorization numbers (credit cards), and making long distance
phone calls utilizing those numbers without -COMPANY-'s consent or the
consent of -COMPANY-'s customers who have been assigned the numbers. He
said that in -DATE-, 1989 -COMPANY- received a phone call from a 
customer who said that another person was utilizing his code to 
make long distance phone calls without his permission.

Smith said that he called the phone number that had been called 
by the person illegally using the -COMPANY- authorization code and he
was told by the party answering the phone that an individual named
-DEFENDANT- had made the call in question.  In -DATE- and -DATE-,
1989, he followed up leads that indicated to him that this person
named -DEFENDANT- had made several long distance phone calls from
-CITY-, XXXXXXXX County, -STATE- using -COMPANY- authorization codes
assigned to customers without their consent. Smith learned
this information by talking to the -COMPANY- customers and persons whose
phones had been called by the person utilizing the codes
without their owner's consent.

Through investigative work, Smith learned the pager number of an
individual named -DEFENDANT- who lived in -CITY-. Smith said he
called that pager number and left as the phone number to be called
his own direct work number in -CITY-, -STATE-. On -DATE-,
1989, and individual identifying himself as -DEFENDANT- called Smith
on his direct line and said he was returning the call to his pager.

Smith stated that the -COMPANY- phone system had the capacity to record
information about incoming calls and when he looked at this
information, he learned that the person who called on that date,
was calling from -CITY-, XXXXXXXX County, -STATE- and was utilizing
an -COMPANY- authorization code that had been assigned to a -COMPANY- customer
who had not given the caled permission to use the code. Smith
looked at other -COMPANY- records that showed that the code number in
question had been "hacked" on -DATE-, 1989.

Smith said that on -DATE-, 1989, he asked -BELL EMP.- an
employee of Bell Telephone Company to set up a trap
and trace on its -CITY- Lines so that the caller from -CITY-
could be identified. -BELL EMP.- reported back that numerous
phone calls were being made to the -COMPANY- system from a residence in
-CITY-, XXXXXXXX County, -STATE- at -ADDRESS-.  -BELL EMP.-
said that phone service was set up at that residence for -DEFENDANT-.
-BELL EMP.- said he continued the trap and trace until
-DATE-, 1989. He said that during that period of time, frequent
calls were made into the -COMPANY- system. The calls were usually made
between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am.

Smith said that during the time that Bell Telephone continued
its trap and trace, -COMPANY- monitored its system to see what the caller
was doing. Smith said that -COMPANY's- records indicate that most of
the calls made into -COMPANY- during this period of time were of a
searching nature. That is, the caller made frequent calls, one
after another, using a different authorization number in each
instance but using the same end destination phone number each time.
The phone calls were made one or two per minute.

I know, though my experience that these searching calls are made
for the sole purpose of discovering valid authorization numbers so
that the numbers can be used to make long distance phone calls for
free. I know that once these valid codes are obtained, they are
kept by the caller in notes, ledgers, papers or other medium.
Smith told me that -COMPANY- verified that the caller was able to
discover 12 valid codes in this manner and that many long distance
phone calls were made from the -DEFENDANT-'s residence utilizing these
stolen codes.

I visited the residence of -DEFENDANT- and affirmed that the
description of the place and premises given above is true and
correct.

WHEREFORE, your affaint asks for the issuance of a warrant that
will authorize him to search said place and premises for said
implements, instruments, property and items and to seize the same.


                                   XXXXXXX XXXXX, Affaint


SUBSCRIBED and SWORN to before me, by the said affaint on this the
1 day of -DATE-, 1989.

warrant. A warrant was issued, eqipment was confiscated, and the person in
question was charged with several counts of credit card abuse.
