April-something, 1990.
Special "Yeah, We're Back and We're Bad" Issue!


===========================
= info following brought  =
= on by a need for more   =

===========================

     Wow.. Where to start. First off, I apologize for the late start. I will
never let there be a gap this big in our issues again! I had a difficult
semester, and such... but, from now on,  ATI will be coming out every 2-3
weeks at the most!
     Lots of things have happened since our last issue.  But the one that
comes to mind at the present is the LOD/Phrack bust.  At the present, we
know that Knight Lightning and The Prophet have been indicted on several
counts, related to the alleged theft of the Bell South Enhanced 911 (E911)
program and related text files, and their subsequent release in Phrack (the
offending item appeared in Phrack 24).  They are expected to be tried
sometime this summer.
     In conjunction with the indictments of KL and TP, LOD members The Mentor
and Erik Bloodaxe were raided at their homes in Austin, and their equipment
was confiscated. Mentor's place of employment, Steve Jackson Games (host of
the Illuminati BBS) was raided, and all their computer equipment was also
taken.  The equipment taken may never be  returned, and SJ Games estimates
their losses in lost revenue and opportunities to be about $1/2 million.
Jolnet, the system that TP allegedly used to transfer the E911 files to KL
for editing in Phrack was also confiscated. And I have received word that
indictments will be handed down within a few weeks for the Austin
members of LOD.
     The indictments of TP and KL appeared in Pirate magazine, and the
Computer Underground Digest.  You may receive copies of the Computer
Underground Digest, a professional online newsletter dealing with the
hack/phreak/pirate world by writing to: TK0JUT2@NIU.BITNET.  Tell 'em ATI
sent you!
     (You may also obtain current or back issues of ATI thru the internet by
writing to: uunet!tronsbox!akcs.groundzero and specifying what you want!)
     Anyway, I feel especially bad for TP, with whom I used to have some very
interesting political arguments on some BBSs, most notably the Phoenix
Project in its hayday back in late 88-early 89. In light of all this
hullabaloo, it should be noted that TP was definitely not a subversive, on
the contrary, he was rather conservative politically. Later on in this
file, I will share some interesting buffers from the Phoenix Project.
     Now, it's time to check in with Prime and the latest edition of PAWN,

  In 1968, Huey Newton called CA Governor Ronald Reagan a "punk" and
threatened to beat him to death with a marshmallow.
 I suggest he's less a punk than a wimp, and imply that the marshmallow
would have surely done him in on the first blow.
 Massachusets US Rep Joe Kennedy jumped on the bandwagon and admitted having
dabbled in weed in his younger dayz. That's right. He used to smoke pot!!!

THE BUG STOPS HERE by Richard Sweeny
  a  pap, (prime anarchist production)
    ///
   Not the best written article I've found on the subject, but it's
   fresh and new, so I thought I'd grab it here.
   Are there legal remedies if your privacy is wrongfully invaded?
   For some time you suspected that your phone was tapped or your home or
office was bugged. You had the premises inspected, and sure enough, a list-
ening device was found in operation. What do you do next? Can you sue for
civil damages?
   If the invasion of privacy occured in compliance with court order, it is
unlikely that a lawsuit will be successful. If a law enforcement agency
was not involved, you may be able to sue if you can prove who the
guilty party is. This is where most invasion of privacy lawsuits dead end,
because it is very difficult to prove ownership of a listening device, and
even more difficult to prove who placed it in operation.
   If you are fortunate to know beyond a doubt who the guilty party is,
there are several ways the snoop may have broken the law. The most obvious
are: electronic eavesdropping, possesion of burglary tools, breaking and
entering, respassing, possession of eavesdropping devices, bribery,
furnishing false identification (impersonating a law enforcement officer),
attachment of foreign devices to telephone and power lines, tampering with
utility lines, and conspiracy with a client to commit any of the above.

From: DRUID OF ORANGE (#71)

Subj: (R)Duck Fuck

When I have a lonely weener, I get out my vacuum cleaner.
In the close,there she sits.  She's got a hole,but no tits.
Gives a blowjob like no other,then cleans rugs for my mother

ELECTROLUX-really sucks
FILTER QUEEN-makes me cream
SANITAIRE-eats me rare
BLACK & DECKER-chews my pecker

Girls are such a fuckin' pain,my vacuum swallows,won't complain.
I pump her ose down to the bag,she deep throats & NEVER gag,sno more cum
shots in my eye,cause my vacuum sucks me dry.

During my last Hoover fuck,a stray bolt of lightning struck,my vacuum got
supercharged,down the tube my balls discharged.
I guess the suction was too strong'cause my dick's now three feet long.

coming soon:
Liberace Was Addicted To Crack




Wasn't that special? Now, for a neat-0 story from The Mad Fishmonger:



                             QUANTUM MIX-UP
                             A True Story
          "The laws of physics have no basis in reality.
           They describe the operation of the human mind."

     Reality inverted itself, revealing the truth at the core of all these
illusions.  Suddenly I could see more clearly, although my eyes were
closed.  The world remained the same, but reality changed completely.  In
the background, Carl Sagan's voice droned on about trillions of trillions
of stars.  Everything stopped and increased in its rapidascent towards the
depths of nothing.  Suddenly, I was surrounded by fourty-seven trillion
black cats who were both dead and alive and were therefore neither dead not
alive.  It all depends on which space-time continuum you happen to be in.
 A short, bald man approached me and asked, "What if the earth were
toroidial, duo-equatorial and uni-polar?"  and walked on before I could
respond.
    Then I perceived a little bearded man in a white robe on the non-
Euculidean checker-board with me, infinitely far away, but approaching.
Space became time and time became space in a never-ending cycle, and the
man approached. I noticed that each time he passed one of the ambiguous
cats, he pointed his non-existant staff at it and read one of the infinite
numbers from the parchment in his hand.  As he did this, each cat
disappeared but was still there.  Finally the man approached me, glanced at
me absent-mindedly, and began to read another number.  Half way through
the lengthy number, he looked up at me again with a puzzled expresion.
"What are you doing here? This is Schrodinger's Cat's department.  Humans
are on plane #1793242123, department, um, it's slipped my mind.  Ask the
thing at the Information Desk.  I'm going to have to complain.  I've had
over seventy-three billion quantum mix-ups this afternoon.  They had a pink
elephant in with Pavlov's Dogs.  Quality control isn't getting their job
done.  We've had so much trouble since Heisenberg came up with his principle.
 What's it called?" hepondered, scratching his head with his non-existant
staff.  "I'm uncertain. Oh yes!  That's it."
     Throughout his speech I couldn't get a word in edgewise, and he
certainly wasn't helping to clear up any questions.  As far as I could see,
there were three possible explanations for what was occuring:  either I was
havinga really strange dream, or I was the subject of some government
experiment, or there was something other than tomato juice in that tomato
juice I drank last night.  Finally, having collected my jumbled thoughts
into another, equally jumbled state, I asked, "Who are you?"
    "Who am I?," he repeated with a look of genuine suprise.  "Why, I'm the
Eigenstate Determiner.  What universe are you from?"
    "What do you mean 'Which Universe?' I'm in The Universe, I think ..
My god .."  "Yes?" he answered before I could finish.
    I jumped.  He sure didn't look like the gaseous vertibrate alpha-male
I had seen pictures of.  "Oh, nothing," I responded, hoping he wouldn't zap
me. Then, as an afterthough, I asked, "Say, how do I get back to Earth?"
    "Just go the the Information Desk and they will send you to your
department where you will be assigned to an eigenstate," he answered.
"Well, I've got to go," he continued.  "Time is about to pass."  He turned
and hurried off, making more cats disappear and still be there.
     I realized, too late, that I had no idea where this Information Desk
was located, so I began wandering randomly among the fourty seven trillion
black cats.  After several hours of this, Robin Hood jumped out from behind
of an invisible tree.  "Who goes there?" he demanded.  I noted that the
arrow in his bow was greatly foreshortened.  "Me," I responded, wondering
if my answer gave him the information he wanted.  Finally , after a long
pause, I asked, "Where is the Information Desk?"
     "Oh, you're another of the Quantum Mix-Ups, not a probability bandit.
You never can tell these nano-seconds.  Its right over there."  He pointed
behind him.  There, just a few giga-parsecs in the indicated direction, was
the Information Desk.  I walked through the Yeti department and past a few
hundred trillion Shakespears trying to duplicate the writings of a monkey
typing random keys on a typewriter.  Finally I got in line behind a pink
elephant and seventy-three billion other very confused life forms, including
a few other carbon based ones.  I waited for a few eons and soon got to the
front. A little green thing with a badge identifying it as a "Quantum
Corrections Officer" glanced up at me.
    "There you are," it snapped, appearing slightly annoyed.  "Well, wadaya
want?"
    "I was just wandering if I could get back to Earth," I replied.
    Its three eyes peered over the tops of its spectacles.  "Why should I
tell you?"
    "Because I'm important!" I blurted out.
    "No you're not," it snapped back.  "You are merely a character in a
story.  For all I know, you may not exist at all.  I once had a cat with
that problem.  Very sad.  Very sad indeed."
    "But I'm the main character!" I implored.
    "All right, all right," it conceeded, with the air of one who has been
interupted from something very important.  "Plane #1793242123, department
#6443512, right that way.  Better hurry."
    I started out "that way".  En route I was approached by little men
selling stone postcards from Crete, but they were driven away when belgian
endives began raining out of the sky.  Finally I could see a huge group of
people in the distance.  As I got closer I recognized all of them as being
me.  I joined them and began discussing politics, religion, water
floridization, and other scandals.  They seemed to be a very agreeable
group of people. After quite a while my attention was caught by the little
man in the robe.  He was busy making other me's disappear but still be
there.  At first this enraged me, but soon it didn't seem like such a big
deal.  After all, there were nine hundred seventy-six trillion of me here.
Eventually the little man approached me and began to consult his parchment.
I could see what I recognized to be the Probability Wave Equations scrawled
on it.
    "Wait a minute!"  I demanded.  "What are you doing?"
    "Measuring you," he replied, pointing his non-existant staff at me and
reading off some big number.
    Reality uninverted itself and truth became hidden in illusions once
again.  My eyes were open, but I could not see clearly.  The world remained
the same but reality changed completely.  I became aware of my physics
teacher explaining the theory behind the Schrodinger's Cat paradox:  "If
you put a cat in a box with a device which will kill the cat at a
completely random time, you don't know if the cat is alive or dead until
you look in the box.  According to the Probability Wave Equation, it is
alive in one alternate parallel universe, and dead in another.  However,
the laws of Quantum Mechanics prove that, until you open the box, the cat
is both dead and alive and is therefore neither dead nor alive.  The only
way to tell which eigenstate you are in is to look in the box.  Measurement
is merely a method to determine which universe you are in.

12 23-FEB-1990 09:19 SCIENTIST CLAIMS GOVERNMENT WANTED CANCER REPORT ALTERED


   COLUMBIA, S.C. (UPI) -- THE AUTHOR OF A FEDERAL STUDY THAT
REVEALED UNUSUALLY HIGH CANCER RATES AMONG WORKERS AT THE ROCKY FLATS
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PLANT IN COLORADO SAID HE WAS PRESSURED TO CHANGE HIS
FINDINGS BY ENERGY DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS.
   SCIENTIST GREGG S. WILKINSON, SPEAKING ON THE MATTER FOR THE FIRST
TIME THURSDAY, TOLD A DOE ADVISORY PANEL THAT THE ATTEMPTED COERCION
CAME FROM HIS SUPERIORS AT THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY, FROM
THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT'S REGIONAL OFFICE IN ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., AND
FROM A DOE ASSISTANT SECRETARY IN WASHINGTON.
   ''THE RESULTS WERE ILL-ACCEPTABLE. THEY WERE VERY UNHAPPY,''
WILKINSON SAID OF THE RESPONSE TO HIS FINDINGS FROM DOE OFFICIALS AND
THOSE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH OPERATES LOS ALAMOS
UNDER CONTRACT TO DOE.
   THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST SAID HE WAS CALLED TO THE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE AT
THE LABORATORY, WHERE HE WAS ''BERATED AND ACCUSED OF NOT HAVING
THESE RESULTS PROPERLY REVIEWED.''
   ''ONE OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WAS MADE TO ME WAS THAT, WE SHOULD
NOT BE TRYING TO PLEASE PEER REVIEWERS, BUT RATHER WE SHOULD BE
PUBLISHING TO PLEASE THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT,''' WILKINSON RECALLED.
''HE SAID THEY WERE A CUSTOMER OF OURS. THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE TO ME
BY A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LOS ALAMOS.''
   WILKINSON'S REMARKS CAME IN A HEARING CONDUCTED AS PART OF DOE'S
MASSIVE EFFORT TO DETERMINE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OVERALL HEALTH
EFFECTS OF WORKING AT NUCLEAR WEAPONS PLANTS SUCH AS ROCKY FLATS, THE
SAVANNAH RIVER SITE NEAR AIKEN, S.C., AND THE HANFORD RESERVATION IN
WASHINGTON STATE.
   CRITICS CONTEND THE STUDIES SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF DOE'S HANDS
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT THE AGENCY'S INVOLVEMENT WILL PREJUDICE ANY
CONCLUSIONS.
   WILKINSON DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO PRESSURED HIM BUT HE SAID
HE WAS THREATENED WITH DEMOTION IF THE RESULTS WERE PUBLISHED.
   ''THERE WAS VERY DEFINITE PRESSURE FROM SEVERAL SOURCES WITHIN THE
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO, IF NOT WITHDRAW RESULTS FROM THE STUDY, TO
CHANGE THE FINDINGS OR THE INTERPRETATION,'' WILKINSON SAID.
   AFTER THE REPORT WAS PRINTED IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM IN THE FEBRUARY
1987 EDITION OF THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, WILKINSON'S
RESEARCH GROUP WAS MERGED WITH ANOTHER OPERATION AT LOS ALAMOS,
EFFECTIVELY LIMITING HIS DIRECT AUTHORITY OVER SUCH STUDIES.
   ''I NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS (WITH) NATIONAL CANCER
INSTITUTE CONTRACTS, CONTRACTS WITH OTHER AGENCIES,'' SAID WILKINSON.
''NOTHING LIKE THIS, EVER.''
   DOE SPOKESMAN JEFF SHERWOOD SAID HE COULD NOT RESPOND TO
WILKINSON'S CONTENTIONS BUT HE RESTATED THE AGENCY'S COMMITMENT TO
THE HEALTH REVIEW AND NOTED OVERSIGHT CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO
ENSURE CREDIBILITY.

Yes, and probably using a stolen authorization code. Several years ago
we went through the era of "flat-rate" long distance. Without exception,
it was fraudulent. Back then, you would sign up with the company and they
would give you a 950 number to call (it was usually Sprint or MCI) and an
authorization code that would allow you to makeas many calls as you like
for $200 a month.  They would concoct some excuse or another as to why
they would have to keep giving you new authorization codes, but now it seems
that they can make this invisible to the "customer" via dialers. It is very
reassuring to note that even the scam artists keep up with available
technology.

If by "best service" you mean "how long is it before the gendarmarie
come banging on your door", the answer is about 2-3 months. You will
probably get off light if you cooperate.I'd be happy to eat my words if
wrong, but think about it for a moment.  Many companies, including my humble
self, spend many times $200 a month for long distance. If something like
this was legitimate, I (and a stampede-load of others) would cancel my
Sprint, AT&T, and WATS services in a second. The next call you make should
probably be to the authorities!
