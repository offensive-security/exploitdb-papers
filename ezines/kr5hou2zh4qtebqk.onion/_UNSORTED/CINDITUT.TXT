	ARE YOU SITTING COMFORTABLY ?
	-----------------------------

	THEN I'LL BEGIN.

 -----------------------------------------
 1. Identifying Voice Mail System As CINDI
 -----------------------------------------

 When you have connected to your System, upon pressing #,
 You should get a voice saying :

    "Please enter the persons name using your touchtone keypad, last 
    name followed by first. To enter a Q or a Z push 1... etc etc.."

 Also when you get kicked off the message will be:

    "Thank You, Good-Day." 

 One of the most common phrases you are likely to hear will be: 

    "If you'd like to speak with someone press zero"

    This is contained in almost all instruction lists.

 ----------------------------------------------
 2. Ok So It's CINDI... So How Do I Find A Box? 
 ---------------------------------------------- 

 Mailboxes Are Going To Be Either 3 or 4 Digits.

 The CINDI Mailboxes Mostly come in Blocks...

 e.g. 860,861,862,865 etc

 So When You Find One Person You Can Find Lots Of Others.

 When Looking For Boxes The System Will Kick You Off If You Get A Box Number
 Wrong After Three Tries. 

 The Three Possibilities For Mailboxes Are:

	1: Invalid Box  "Mailbox XXX Does Not Exist !"
	2: The Greeting Of The Owner Will Play
	3: It Will Say "Mailbox XXX"

 Once You Have At Least One Valid Box Number Everything Is sooo EASY!
 
 Upon Second Failure (Of Invalid Mailbox Number)Press Hash To Enter 
 Another Box Number. Now Enter A Valid Box Number.
 If You Don't Want That Box You Can Press '0'
 Then Instead Of entering Password You Can Press '#' To Enter Another Box
 Number, Now There Is No Fear Of Being Cut Off.

 Admin Boxes Are Found At Numbers Like 991, 900, 100, 101 although
 Some Systems Require You To Press '0' As Soon As Connected.......
 This Will Then Give You An 'Enter Passcode' Prompt.

 ----------------------------------------------------
 3. Strategic Hacking Using The 'Fault' Of The System.
 ----------------------------------------------------

 The easiest method to hack a box is as follows:

 e.g. Mailbox you want to hack is 1000.

 a. When the system asks you to enter your mailbox number enter: 1000.
 b. When the message starts playing you can press '0' to stop.
 c. The system will then ask you for a password.
 d. The Default Password on a CINDI system is (LAME) '0'
    Most Users will have passwords of:

	Mailbox number.
	'123 (4)'
	1, 2, 3, --> 9..
	
	Passwords Are 3/4 Digits...
	
    Odds are at Least 1/8 Of users will have passwords like these..

 e. If Password was wrong, then try another..
 f. Upon 2nd Failed Attempt press '#' - This causes the system to give you 
    an 'Enter Mailbox' Prompt... You can repeat this Over, and Over...
    The System Doesn't Kick You Off and you can find Them Boxes...

    ****      Nice Little Bug In The Software METHINKS!!!!      ****

 ---------------------------------------------------------

	One Thing To Remember Is, Once Call Has Been Made Or Not, Check Up 
 	On The Status Of Messages And If A Call Couldn't Be Completed Then
	Kill It As To Avoid Leaving Your Number On The System..
     
       ( Note On Some Systems Call Placement May Be Off Or Only Available
