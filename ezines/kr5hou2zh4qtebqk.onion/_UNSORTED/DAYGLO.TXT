  -> Author's note:
 
     Yes, yes, I know that this box is similar to several other boxes,
  including the so-called "Bud box," and the "beige box." Well, my reason for
  writing this version is because of the fact that once finished constructing
  the box, the file does not contain very much information on usage. It is
  beacuse of that reason that this file was written. By the way, call
  Ground 0 at 988-4426. Thank you.
 
  -> What is the function of a Day-Glo box?
 
     Well, a Day-glo box will let you place calls for free with no time limit,
  no possibility of a wiretap, and the calls can be placed from anywhere in the
  world. Too good to be true, you say? Well, read on.
 
  -> How does a Day-glo box work?
 
     A day-glo box is very easy to make, and very inexpensive to build. It
  works like this: On the outside of every home that has a phone, there is
  something called "the outside connection box," which is where the house is
  connected to Ma Bell's network. This ingenious device connects to a) your
  phone, b) the victim's outside box. You should be starting to get the idea.
 
  -> How do I construct a day-glo box?
 
     Materials necessary: 1. Radio Shack modular conversion jack
                          2. A small experimenter's box (optional)
                          3. 1 foot of red wire. (better to overkill)
                          4. 1 foot of green wire. (same as above)
                          5. 2 medium alligator clips
 
     Well, in order to construct this box, you will need all of the above
  materials. Note that your wire does not necessarily have to be red or green,
  but it is necessary that you be able to tell them apart. Also, you might want
  to use thick, easily bent wire (audio hookup wire works best) instead of bell
  wire. Now, on to the construction.
 
     1. Remove the actual modular jack from the conversion box. This can be
        done by pushing inward and then up, or you can just cut the plastic.
 
     2. Remove the black and yellow wires from the jack. You can either clip
        these or rip them out.
 
     3. To your newly isolated jack, add the 1 foot wire extensions to the
        respective wires. Soldering and then wrapping the connections with
        electrical tape works best.
 
     4. Next, solder the alligator clips to the extended wires. If you do not
        wish to solder them, then just wrap the clips with the wire.
 
     5. Now, place this newly made contraption into a box (optional). You may
        need to drill a few holes, and possibly remove the alligator clips,
        but you should have read this file first, anyway.

     Pretty easy, eh?
 
  -> Usage of the day-glo box
 
     The day-glo box will work with any phone. First, you need to locate a
  house that has a phone. Next, (it's preferable to do this at night) go up
  to the and locate the outside connection box. Pop the cover off. Locate
  prong 3 and prong 4. You will attach the green wire clip to prong 3. The
  red wire clip will go to prong 4. Now, plug your phone (preferably a
  trimline or ranger) into your modular plug. You may now either listen in on
  the call (wire tap) OR you may call out to anywhere in the world. If you
  are really daring, you can bring your computer with you. Note: This box
  may also be used in conjunction with the lunch box in order to make a
  perfect phone bug.
 
  -> Other neat things you can do with your new box:
 
     1: Call 976 numbers. This should be done very frequently. Also, I find
        that after finding the victim's outside box, several calls to the
        gay hotlin will have interesting after-effects; namely, his parents
        wondering about him.
 
     2: Alliance teleconferencing can be accomplished quite easily. Try it!
        Call 0-700-456-1000. Or, tell the operator you'd like to initiate a
        conference.
 
     3: Of course, you should place several calls to other countries. This can
        be accomplished by looking in the front of your white pages for the
        various country and city codes. You should be able to follow the
        directions provided in there.
 
  -> Using your box at apartments/community connection boxes:
 
     Have you ever wondered what those 6ft tall cabinets with the bell logo on
  them were for? Well, if you've never seen them, here's a quick description:
  They are 6ft tall by 3ft wide, and painted the dull phone company green.
  They can be opened quite easily with a 7/16ths inch socket wrench. After
  turning the bold over the handle, turn the handle to the right and pull. It
  should open, displaying over 100 different lines. Occasionally, you can find
  tech. manuals and test kits inside. They are usually located near phone
  lines.
 
     Okay, now, once you have opened one of these calling cabinets, locate the
  line of your choice. You will have to take out both the orange and the white
  insulated screws. The purple and white wires should come off along with the
  screws. The lines go out to the house, and the screw posts are the actual
  line. Now, you should clip the alligators to the posts, with one part of
  the clip on the insulation, and one inside the screw hole to insure the
  best connection. Oh, if you want the home to remain connected, clip the
  wires inside the hole using the alligator clips. By the way, the red
  terminal on your box goes to the orange post, and the green one to the
  white post... if that doesn't work, reverse the connection. Now, to find
  out the number you have taken over, dial 380-55555555. Yes, that's eight
  fives. A computer voice should tell you what number you are on. heh.
 
     I hope you can take it from here. Oh, in apartments, you can find the
  calling cabinet in the basement... remember, this is not your line, so do
  anything you want. Call the President or something.
