  The Crimson Box is very simple device that will allow you to put
  someone on hold or make your fone busy with a large amount of
  ease. You flip a switch and the person can't hear you talking.
  Flip it back and everything is peechy.

  (1) 100 ohm or less resistor
  (1) SPDT toggle switch, On-On
  (3) feet of good wire
  Wire cutters
  Solder and soldering iron

  First I will give you the schematic and then I will explain what
  the hell is going on.
 
  -----------black wire on line---------
  --------+   red wire on line   +------
  --------!--+/\/\/-green wire---!------
  --------!--! yellow wire-------!------
          !  !                   !
          +--!------+            !
             +----+ ! +----------+
                  ! ! !
                  1 2 3
 
  Ok. The '/\/\/' is the resistor. And '1 2 3' is the switch where
  the numbers are the poles on the switch. Notice you leave the
  black and yellow wires alone.  You DO NOT cut them!
 
  Strip the red and green wires so you've got about an inch of
  bare wire. Solder some of the extra wire and follow the
  schematic. You should have the resistor on the green wire with
  an extra piece of wire coming from one leg of it. The other leg
  goes to the other end of the green wire. You should solder the
  green wire to the left pole of the switch and the red to the
  middle and the other end of the red to the right pole.
 
  Now, lift up the phone. If all you get is an annoying buzz then
  throw the [switch and you should get a dial tone.  If not, don't
  worry and just follow the instructions and schematic again.
