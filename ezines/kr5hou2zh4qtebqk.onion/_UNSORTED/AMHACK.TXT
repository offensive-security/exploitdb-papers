    AT&T reports that in the year 1990, 11 million people
will buy an answering machine for their home use. In 1989, 10
million machines were sold. Everyone has called up a person
at one time or another and got the old "leave your name at
the beep" message. With this increase in homes using these
machines there is also a new form of hacking developing. One
of hacking an answering machine.

    Why would anyone even want to hack an answering machine
and for what purpose? There are many reasons and things you
can do once you have control of someone elses machine. If for
some reason you need to spy on a business or person you can
hack their machine and take control using the information for
your own personal use. There is also the old "change the
message" secret to make it say something to the effect of
this line accepts all toll charges so you can bill third
party calls to that number. You can also use an answering
machine for your own personal use, as in making it your own
voice mail type system for people to call. Only do this if
you know someone is out of town. If they come home from
shopping and find their machine changed it might cause
problems. With these basic ideas in mind you can see hacking
an answering machine could be very useful to certain
individuals.

    How can a person hack an answering machine? Well most
answering machines built now have remote access features
which allow the owner, or anyone to call in and press a
security code to play their messages. This is where the fun
begins.  Some older models don't have remote access so you
cannot do anything to them. Also if you know someone has a
machine but you call and it doesn't answer, let the phone
ring about 15 times. This will tell the machine to turn
itself on, so you can hack it. The actual number varies
between machines.

    To practice hacking some machines i will show you how to
get remote access on a few models. Just look and see what
kind your friend has and hack it for starters.

Hacking answering machines can be very easy. It can also help
you obtain valuable information. If you have a targeted
machine you can try going to a store and saying you just
bought one and it didn't have instructions in the box. They
will usually give you a set or make copies for you. This
basic guide is just to introduce you to answering machine
hacking and changing the outgoing message and listening to
messages left by callers. To keep your own machine safe
purchase one with a changeable security code of 3 or more
digits. Most home machines are of the 1 digit type and are
easy to hack. I have no knwoledge of the laws concerning
hacking into someones answering machine. I am sure once it
becomes more common we will find out. Of course this article
is for informational purposes only so you would never have to
find out the actual laws.
