INTRODUCTION:

     With the plethora of on-line databases in the public and private sectors,
I feel it is becoming increasingly important to penetrate and maintain access
to these databases.  The databases in question contain data pertaining to our
personal lives and to our environment, not to mention the tetrabytes of useful
information that can be directed toward research and personal education.


     Who or What is DIALOG?

     The DIALOG Information Network is a service that links various public and
commercial databases together for convenience.  In the past, when one wanted to
access LEGAL RESOURCE INDEX, for instance, one would have to dial direct.  With
DIALOG, hundreds of databases are connected via X.25 networks (Tymnet,
Sprintnet, Uninet, Dialnet) eliminating frustrating searching and outrageous
long distance telephone bills (before the AT&T divestiture).

     Further, within this file is a PARTIAL list of databases found on-line.
Some of the databases are nothing more than periodicals and abstract sources,
while others provide FullText articles and books.  There are over 2500
periodicals, newspapers, newsletters and newswires on-line in FullText.

Here are a few of my favorites:

McGraw-Hill Publications On-Line (File624)

     - Services offer FullText of their Newsletters serving the world-wide
aerospace and defense industry.  Complete text from 30 newsletters such as
AeroSpace Daily, BYTE, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Data Communications,
ENR, among others.  For more info on the database, when in DIALOG type Help
News624.

PR NEWSWIRE (File613)

     - PR Newswire records contain the complete text of news releases prepared
by:  companies; public relations agencies; trade associations; city, state,
federal and non-US Government agencies; and other sources covering the entire
spectrum of news.  The complete text of a news release typically contains
details or background information that is not published in newspapers.  More
than 8500 companies contribute news for PR Newswire.  PR NEWSWIRE is a known
agent of Corporate Intelligence.

DMS/FI MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORTS (File589)

     - FullText of World AeroSpace Weekly, covers all aspects of both civil and
       military aerospace activities worldwide.
     - World Weapons Review, very high degree of technical detail and
       perspective.  As such, it has special appeal to military professionals
       and users of weapons.

Note:  The database treats the newsletters as separate Binders.  For example,
       to access the World Weapons Review, after connecting to the database,
       type:

              SELECT BN=WORLD WEAPONS REVIEW
              or whichever newsletter you wish to search.

FINE CHEMICALS DATABASE (File360)

     - The focus of this database is on sources for laboratory, specialty, and
unusual chemicals used in scientific research and new product development.
Fine chemicals are relatively pure chemicals typically produced in small
quantities.  The database will provide you with manufacturers and/or
distributors.

DUN'S ELECTRONIC YELLOW PAGES (File515)

     - Largest database of U.S. businesses available on DIALOG, providing
information on a total of 8.5 million establishments.  Corporate intelligence:
you can quickly verify the existence of a business.  Then you can obtain
address, telephone number, employee size, Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) and other basic information.

CURRENT CONTENTS SEARCH (File440)

     - FullText articles from over 8000+ worldwide journals dealing with
science and technology.

BOOKS IN PRINT (File470)

     - Access to in-print and out-of-print books since 1979, BIP lets you
retrieve bibliographic data on virtually every book published or distributed in
the United States.  Plus FullText reviews on the book(s) you have selected.
See next.

PUBLISHERS DISTRIBUTORS AND WHOLESALERS ON-LINE (File450)

     - PDW on-line will locate virtually any book, audio cassette, software
publisher, distributor, or wholesaler in the U.S.

     You now should have an idea of the power and scope of the Dialog
Information Network.

NOTE:  Most of DIALOG's Services are now available to certain Research
       facilities, public and private, on CD-ROM.  Check your local public and
       university libraries for this service.  Of course, MANY of the more
       interesting databases are not available on CD-ROM and must still be
       accessed through the DIALOG network.


                           Access to DIALOG Services

     The following on-line services are available from DIALOG Information
Services:

              DIALOG
              DIALOG Business (DBC)
              DIALOG Medical Connection (DMC)
              DIALMAIL
              KNOWLEDGE INDEX

     The logon procedures for the first four are identical and use the same
service address; procedures for KNOWLEDGE INDEX differ only in the use of the
KI service address, as illustrated throughout this file.

     The most common method of access to DIALOG services uses local phone
numbers for three telecommunication networks: DIALOG's DIALNET, BT Tymnet,
TYMNET, and SprintNet.  For those who live in an area that lacks a local dialup
for those three networks, you may use the 800 link into the DIALNET for access
to all DIALOG services except KNOWLEDGE INDEX.  This access is not free, but it
may cost less than dialing long-distance to reach a network node if you live in
a region without local access.  Access is also available through gateways from
other on-line systems.

     Access to many DIALOG services is available from countries throughout the
world and may be accessed from their own Public Data Networks.

Dialnet 800-Number Access

The two DIALNET 800 numbers are available for connecting to Dialog services
from anywhere in the 48 contiguous states.  Access through these numbers is not
free.

     (800)DIALNET     300, 1200, and 2400 b. (w/MNP error checking)
     (800)342-5638

     (800)847-1620    VADIC 3400 series modems (1200 baud)
                      BELL 103 modems (300 baud)
                      BELL 212 modems (1200 baud)

Note:  I have excluded all the dialup numbers for Tymnet and Sprintnet.  If you
       don't know how to find those, obtain a file on X.25 nets and I'm sure
       they will be listed somewhere in them.

                       Access to Dialog Outside of the US

     Foreign readers may access Dialog via the INFONET PDN.  The following
numbers are for those particular users.

     BELGIUM
     Brussels (300).............................(02)648-0710
     Brussels (1200)............................(02)640-4993

                  Logging in to DIALOG or KNOWLEDGE INDEX (KI)

     After dialing the appropriate number and establishing the connection, you
must allow a 10-second delay and then enter the letter A (or a carriage return
or another terminal identifier from the table below) before any further
response will occur.  Then, follow the remainder of the procedures show below.

DIALOG Information Services' DIALNET
-2151:01-012-
Enter Service: dialog                     Enter DIALOG or KI;

DIALNET: call connected
DIALOG INFORMATION SERVICES
PLEASE LOGON:
?XXXXXXXX                                 Enter User Number

ENTER PASSWORD:
?XXXXXXXX                                 Enter Password;


NOTE:  I have researched the method of user number and password distribution
       and all user numbers and passwords are generated by Dialog, BUT upon
       receiving a password from DIALOG you may opt to change it.  The
       passwords issued from DIALOG are 8 digits long, consisting of random
       alpha-numeric characters.

Once you are connected to your default service or file in DIALOG, you can then
BEGIN one of the other services; for example, to access DIALMAIL, BEGIN MAIL.

                  DIALNET Terminal Identifiers

- For access in half duplex, enter a < CTRL H > after the "Enter Service:"
  prompt and before entering the word "dialog" or "ki."

- Don't hit backspace if you make an error in typing "dialog" or "ki."  The
  result will be toggling your duplex, reason being your backspace is usually
  configured to send a < CTRL H > to delete to the left of the cursor one
  space.

                              Navigating in DIALOG


 To begin a search, one would enter:

              BEGIN xxxx

xxxx would be the database file number.  All databases found on DIALOG are
assigned file numbers.  The searching protocol used to manipulate DIALOG seems
at times to be a language in itself, but it can be easily learned and mastered.


                                DIALOG HOMEBASE

     I would advise the first-timer to jump into the DIALOG Homebase Menu,
which provides information, help, file of the month, database info and rates,
the DIALINDEX, DIALOG Training, and announcements.  DIALOG also provides
subscribers with special services which include dialouts for certain area
codes.  You can begin the DIALOG HOMBASE by typing:

              BEGIN HOME

     Before I continue describing the various methods of searching, DIALOG has
an on-line master index to the DIALOG databases, DIALINDEX (file 411).  It is a
collection of the file indexes of most DIALOG databases (menu-driven databases
cannot be searched in DIALINDEX).  DIALINDEX can be used to determine the
number of relevant records for a single query in a collection of files.  The
query can be a single term, a multiple-word phrase, a prefix-coded field, or a
full logical expression of up to 240 characters.  Nested terminology, proximity
operators, and truncated terms may also be used.

     You can set the files you want searched by using the SET FILE command.
Like this:

              BEGIN 411 (return)

              SET FILE ALLNEWS (if you want the latest news on
                    or          hack/phreak busts)
              SF ALLNEWS

     Once you have selected a database you can now SELECT the search keyword.
You set the flag by:

SELECT term       -  Retrieves a set of records containing the term.
                     May be used with words, prefix or suffix codes, EXPAND, or
                     set numbers.

     When defining what you are searching for you can use logical operators
such as:

     OR - puts the retrieval of all search terms into one set, eliminating
          duplicate records.

    AND - retrieves the intersection, or overlap, of the search terms:  all
          terms must be in each record retrieved.

    NOT - eliminates search term (or group of search terms) following it from
          other search term(s).

     Note:  Always enter a space on either side of a logical operator.

     SELECT Examples:

     SELECT (BICMOS OR CMOS) AND SRAM
                 or
     S (BICMOS OR CMOS) AND SRAM

- This would generate something like this:
              138 BICMOS <- records containing BICMOS only
             1378 CMOS   <- records containing CMOS only
              681 SRAM   <- records containing SRAM only
       S1     203 (BICMOS OR CMOS) AND SRAM  <- this is what you
       ^^                                       wanted.
       || DIALOG names your select topic S1, S2... respectively as search its
          databases to make it easier to type.  The contents of S1 are 203
          found records containing the keywords BICMOS, CMOS, and SRAM.
          Sometimes S1 is referred to as S(tep) 1

PROXIMITY OPERATORS (Select command)

 (W) Requests terms be adjacent to each other and in order
     specified.                   -> S SOLAR(W)ENERGY
(nW) Requests terms be within (n) words of each other and in order
     specified.                   -> S SOLAR(3W)ENERGY
 (N) Requests terms be adjacent but in any order.  Useful for
     retrieving identical terms.  -> S SOLAR(N)ENERGY
(nN) Requests terms be within (n) words of each other and in any
     order.                       -> S SOLAR(3N)ENERGY
 (F) Requests terms be in same field of same record, in any order.
                                  -> S SOLAR(F)ENERGY
 (L) Requests terms be in same descriptor unit as defined by
     database.                    -> S SOLAR(L)ENERGY
 (S) Requests terms be in same Subfield unit as defined by
     database.                    -> S SOLAR(S)ENERGY
 (C) Equivalent to logic operator AND.
                                  -> S SOLAR(C)ENERGY

PRIORITY OF EXECUTION

              Proximity operator, NOT, AND, OR

 Use parentheses to specify different order of execution, e.g. SELECT (SOLAR OR
 SUN) AND (ENERGY OR HEAT).  Terms within parentheses are executed first.

STOP WORDS (predefined)

The following words may not be SELECTed as individual terms.  The computer will
retrieve a set with zero results.  They may only be replaced with proximity
operators, e.g. S GONE(2W)WIND

                   AN       FOR       THE
                   AND      FROM      TO
                   BY       OF        WITH

RESERVED WORDS AND SYMBOLS

The following words and symbols must be enclosed in quotation marks whenever
they are SELECTed as or within search terms, e.g., SELECT "OR"(W)GATE?

              AND         =
              FROM        *
              NOT         +
              OR          :
              STEPS       /

TRUNCATION

OPEN:  any number of characters following stem.
                                                      SS EMPLOY?
RESTRICTED:  only one additional character following stem.
                                                      SS HORSE? ?
RESTRICTED:  maximum number of additional characters equal to
             number of question marks entered.        SS UNIVERS??

INTERNAL:  allows character replaced by question mark to vary. One
           character per question mark.               SS WOM?N


BASIC INDEX FIELD SPECIFICATION (SUFFIX CODES)

Suffix codes are used to restrict retrieval to specified basic index fields of
a record.  Specific fields and codes vary according to the database.

     Abstract                            /AB
     Descriptor                          /DE
     Full Descriptor(single word)        /DF
     Identifier                          /ID
     Full Identifier(single word)        /IF
     Title                               /TI
     Note                                /NT
     Section Heading                     /SH

Examples:

     SELECT BUDGET?/TI
     SELECT POP(W)TOP(W)CAN?/TI,AB
     SELECT (DOLPHIN? OR PORPOISE?)/DE/ID


ADDITIONAL INDEXES (PREFIX CODES)

Prefix codes are used to search additional indexes.  Specific fields and codes
vary according to the database.

     Author                       AU=
     Company Name                 CO=
     Corporate Source             CS=
     Document Type                DT=
     Journal Name                 JN=
     Language                     LA=
     Publication Year             PY=
     Update                       UD=

Examples:

     SELECT AU=JOHNSON, ROBERT?
     SELECT LA=GERMAN
     SELECT CS=(MILAN(F)ITALY)


RANGE SEARCHING

A colon is used to indicate a range of sequential entries to be retrieved in a
logical OR relationship.

Examples:

     SELECT CC=64072:64078
     SELECT ZP=662521:62526


LIMIT QUALIFIERS

Limit qualifiers are used in SELECT statements to limit search terms or sets to
given criteria.  Specific qualifiers vary according to database.

     English language documents   /ENG
     Major descriptor             /MAJ
     Patents                      /PAT
     Human subject                /HUM
     Accession number range       /nnnnnn-nnnnnn

Examples:

     SELECT TRANSISTORS/ENG,PAT
     SELECT S2/MAJ
     SELECT (STRESS OR TENSION)/234567-999999

     Well that's it for basic searching.  Now, how to view the record you have
selected.

     Note:  Indexes (prefix codes) often differ from database to
database, often resulting in futile searches.  One way to avoid this
is to make a trip to the local Public or University Library and look
up the blue sheets for the database you wish to query.  Blue sheets
are issued by dialog as a service to their users.  Blue Sheets often
contain helpful searching techniques ere to the database you are
interested in.  They will also contain a list of Indexes (prefix
codes) unique to that database only.


                             VIEWING SEARCH RESULTS


COMMAND SUMMARY

TYPE            Provides continuous on-line display of results.
T               Specify set/format/range of items.  If Item range is specified,
                use T to view next record.  May also be used with specific
                accession number.

 Examples:    T 12/3/1-22    <- set/format/range
              T 8/7          <- set/format
              T 6            <- view next.(6 in this case)
              T 438721       <- view record 438721


DISPLAY         Provides display of results one screen at a time.  Use
D               PAGE for subsequent screens.
                Specify set/format/range of items.  If range not specified, use
                D to view next record.  May also be used with specific
                accession number.

 Examples:    D 11/6/1-44     <- set/format/range
              D 9/5           <- set/format
              D 7             <- view next.(7 in this case)
              D 637372/7      <- view record 637372/format 7


PRINT            Requests that results be printed offline and mailed.  Specify
                 set/format/range of items.  If item range not specified up to
                 50 records will be printed.  Use PR to print another 50.

 Examples:    PR 9/5/1-44      <- print set/format/range
              PR 6/7           <- print set/format (all)
              PR 14            <- print 14 only
              PR 734443/5      <- print 734443 format 5 only.


PRINT TITLE xxx  To specify a title(xxx) to appear on PRINTs.  Title may
                 contain up to 70 characters.  No semicolon may be used.  Must
                 be entered in database before any other PRINT command is used.
                 Cancelled by next BEGIN.

Examples:     PR TITLE GLOBULIN
              PR TITLE QUETZAL


REPORT           Extracts data from specified fields and produces tabular
                 format for on-line output only.  Specify set/range of
                 items/fields.  May be used with SORTED set to specify order of
                 entries in table.  Application is database-specific.

     Enjoy the DIALOG Information Network.  I've found it most interesting.
This service is a MUST if you are in college or if you just love to learn as 
uch as time permits.  It is a proven research tool used by R&D and university
facilities around the world, as well as a refined corporate intelligence
information gathering tool kept hidden from the general public by sheer expense
and "pseudo-complexity."  With on-line databases like DIALOG available, there
is no excuse (besides lack of time) for self-education.
