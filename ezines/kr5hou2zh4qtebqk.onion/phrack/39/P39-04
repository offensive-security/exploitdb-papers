=====================================================
Welcome to the University of Colorado Netfind server.
=====================================================

I think that your terminal can display 24 lines.
If this is wrong, please enter the "Other" menu and
set the correct number of lines.

Help/Search/Other/Quit [h/s/o/q]: h

Given the name of a person on the Internet and a rough description of where
the person works, Netfind attempts to locate information about the person.
When prompted, enter a name followed by a set of keywords, such as

        schwartz university colorado boulder

The name can be a first, last, or login name.  The keys describe where the
person works, by the name of the institution and/or the city/state/country.

If you know the institution's domain name (e.g., "cs.colorado.edu", where there
are host names like "brazil.cs.colorado.edu") you can specify it as keys
without the dots (e.g., "cs colorado edu").  Keys are case insensitive and may
be specified in any order.  Using more than one key implies the logical AND of
the keys.  Specifying too many keys may cause searches to fail.  If this
happens, try specifying fewer keys, e.g.,

        schwartz boulder

If you specify keys that match many domains, Netfind will list some of the
matching domains/organizations and ask you to form a more specific search.
Note that you can use any of the words in the organization strings (in addition
to the domain components) as keys in future searches.

Organization lines are gathered from imperfect sources.  However, it is usually
easy to tell when they are incorrect or not fully descriptive.  Even if the
organization line is incorrect/vague, the domain name listed will still work
properly for searches.  Often you can "guess" the proper domain.

For example, "cs.<whatever>.edu" is usually the computer science department at
a university, even if the organization line doesn't make this clear.

When Netfind runs, it displays a trace of the parallel search progress, along
with the results of the searches.  Since output can scroll by quickly, you
might want to run it in a window system, or pipe the output through tee(1):

        rlogin <this server name> -l netfind |& tee log

You can also disable trace output from the "Other" menu.

You can get the Netfind software by anonymous FTP from ftp.cs.colorado.edu,
in pub/cs/distribs/netfind.  More complete documentation is also available
in that package.  A paper describing the methodology is available in
pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/RD.Papers/PostScript/White.Pages.ps.Z
(compressed PostScript) or
pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/RD.Papers/ASCII/White.Pages.txt.Z (compressed
ASCII).

Please send comments/questions to schwartz@cs.colorado.edu.  If you would like
to be added to the netfind-users list (for software updates and other
discussions, etc.), send mail to:

netfind-users-request@cs.colorado.edu.

 Commercial Networks Reachable From The Internet
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 By Roman Kanala (kanala@sc2a.unige.ch), CUEPE, University of Geneva

1. Internet to X.400
====================

An X.400 address in form

   First name   : Fffff
   Surname      : Nnnnn
   Organization : Ooooo
   ADMD         : Aaaaa
   Country      : Cc

looks in RFC822 (Internet) addressing like

        /G=Fffff/S=Nnnnn/O=Ooooo/@Aaaa.Cc
or
    in%"/G=Fffff/S=Nnnnn/O=Ooooo/@Aaaa.Cc"



2. Any X.400 to Internet
========================

My Internet address 

                    kanala@sc2a.unige.ch

can be written for X.400 services (like arCom400 in Switzerland,
Sprint MAIL or MCI Mail in the USA) as follows:

        C=CH; ADMD=ARCOM; PRMD=SWITCH; O=UNIGE; OU=SC2A; S=KANALA

and in Internet RFC822 form (althrough I don't see any reason to do it
this way for sending messages from Internet to Internet):

       /S=Kanala/OU=sc2a/O=UniGe/P=Switch/@arcom.ch


3. MCI Mail to Internet (via a gateway)
=======================

If you are in the USA and using MCI Mail, then you can write to Internet
addresses as follows: 

   TO:   Roman Kanala (EMS)
   EMS:  INTERNET
   MBX:  kanala@sc2a.unige.ch

The gateway from MCI Mail to Internet is accessed by referencing the user's
name as though he were on an EMS service.  When EMS name of INTERNET is used
for example, in the USA, then it's in order to have NRI (Reston VA) handle the
message for him.  When prompted for mailbox MBX, user enters the Internet
address he is wanting to send a message to.


4. Internet to MCI Mail
=======================

The general address form is username@mcimail.com, where the username is in one
of two forms: either full username or the numerical box number in form of
digits only and preceded by three zeros, for ex. 0001234567@mcimail.com
(address 1234567 is ficticious).


5. AppleLink to Internet or Bitnet
==================================

Internet address is used with a suffix @INTERNET#, like 

    kanala@sc2a.unige.ch@internet#   
or  kanala@cgeuge52.bitnet@internet#

(here cgeuge52 is the bitnet address of sc2a.unige.ch)


6. Internet or Bitnet to AppleLink
==================================

AppleLink address is used as if it were an Internet username on the
AppleLink.Apple.Com node, like:

CH0389@applelink.apple.com


7. CompuServe to Internet
=========================

In the address field from CompuServe, type the symbol >, "greater than", the
word "INTERNET" in uppercase characters, then a space followed by the Internet
address, like:

>INTERNET kanala@sc2a.unige.ch


8. Internet to CompuServe
=========================

The CompuServe address is used followed by "@compuserve.com". In the 
CompuServe mailbox number the comma is replaces by a period, example:

12345.678@compuserve.com            (address 12345.678 is ficticious)

INTRODUCTION

This file documents methods of sending mail from one network to another.  It
represents the aggregate knowledge of the readers of comp.mail.misc and many
contributors elsewhere.  If you know of any corrections or additions to this
file, please read the file format documentation below and then mail to me:

John J. Chew <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>


DISTRIBUTION

(news) This list is posted monthly to Usenet newsgroups comp.mail.misc and
  news.newusers.questions.  
(mail) I maintain a growing list of subscribers who receive each monthly 
  issue by electronic mail, and recommend this to anyone planning to 
  redistribute the list on a regular basis.  
(FTP) Internet users can fetch this guide by anonymous FTP as ~ftp/pub/docs/
  internetwork-mail-guide on Ra.MsState.Edu (130.18.80.10 or 130.18.96.37)
  [Courtesy of Frank W. Peters]
(Listserv) Bitnet users can fetch this guide from the Listserv at UNMVM.
  Send mail to LISTSERV@UNMVM with blank subject and body consisting of
  the line "GET NETWORK GUIDE".  [Courtesy of Art St. George]


HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

Each entry in this file describes how to get from one network to another.  To
keep this file at a reasonable size, methods that can be generated by
transitivity (A->B and B->C gives A->B->C) are omitted.  Entries are sorted
first by source network and then by destination network.  This is what a
typical entry looks like:

   #F mynet
   #T yournet
   #R youraddress
   #C contact address if any
   #I send to "youraddress@thegateway"
 
For parsing purposes, entries are separated by at least one blank line, and
each line of an entry begins with a "#" followed by a letter.  Lines beginning
with "#" are comments and need not be parsed.  Lines which do not start with a
"#" at all should be ignored as they are probably mail or news headers.

#F (from) and #T (to) lines specify source and destination networks.  If you're
sending me information about a new network, please give me a brief description
of the network so that I can add it to the list below.  The abbreviated network
names used in #F and #T lines should consist only of the characters a-z, 0-9
and "-" unless someone can make a very convincing case for their favourite pi
character.

These are the currently known networks with abbreviated names:

   applelink     AppleLink (Apple Computer, Inc.'s in-house network)
   bitnet        international academic network
   bix           Byte Information eXchange: Byte magazine's commercial BBS
   bmug          Berkeley Macintosh Users Group
   compuserve    commercial time-sharing service
   connect       Connect Professional Information Network (commercial)
   easynet       Easynet (DEC's in-house mail system)
   envoy         Envoy-100 (Canadian commercial mail service)
   fax           Facsimile document transmission
   fidonet       PC-based BBS network
   geonet        GeoNet Mailbox Systems (commercial)
   internet      the Internet
   mci           MCI's commercial electronic mail service
   mfenet        Magnetic Fusion Energy Network
   nasamail      NASA internal electronic mail
   peacenet      non-profit mail service
   sinet         Schlumberger Information NETwork
   span          Space Physics Analysis Network (includes HEPnet)
   sprintmail    Sprint's commercial mail service (formerly Telemail)
   thenet        Texas Higher Education Network

#R (recipient) gives an example of an address on the destination network, to
make it clear in subsequent lines what text requires subsitution.

#C (contact) gives an address for inquiries concerning the gateway, expressed
as an address reachable from the source (#F) network.  Presumably, if you can't
get the gateway to work at all, then knowing an unreachable address on another
network will not be of great help.

#I (instructions) lines, of which there may be several, give verbal
instructions to a user of the source network to let them send mail to a user on
the destination network.  Text that needs to be typed will appear in double
quotes, with C-style escapes if necessary.

#F applelink
#T internet
#R user@domain
#I send to "user@domain@internet#"
#I   domain can be be of the form "site.bitnet", address must be <35
     characters

#F bitnet
#T internet
#R user@domain
#I Methods for sending mail from Bitnet to the Internet vary depending on
#I what mail software is running at the Bitnet site in question.  In the
#I best case, users should simply be able to send mail to "user@domain".
#I If this doesn't work, try "user%domain@gateway" where "gateway" is a 
#I regional Bitnet-Internet gateway site.  Finally, if neither of these
#I works, you may have to try hand-coding an SMTP envelope for your mail.
#I If you have questions concerning this rather terse note, please try
#I contacting your local postmaster or system administrator first before
#I you send me mail -- John Chew <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>
