MCI Cracks Down
---------------

Dr. Crash busted for MCI scanning.  In the early part of December, Dr. Crash
ran a scanner on MCI, MCI traced him and told him to stop, unfortunately Dr.
Hack, another 314er, started scanning the same port later that night.  MCI
didn't trace it again and assumed it was Dr. Crash back at work.  All of his
files were hidden away but MCI and authorities confiscated his Atari computer
and his phone.  MCI security told Dr. Crash that he was part of an ongoing
investigation.  Later that month he had a meeting with MCI security, where they
questioned him about the incident.  His computer, they told him, will arrive in
the mail soon.

Extasyy Elite Disbanded
-----------------------

The following data has not been completely researched and may be considered as
rumors. Bit Blitz busted for phreaking, the organization and enforcement
agencies are unknown. However, $3000 worth of computer material (7 computers)
were confiscated.  Also it is reported that The Mentor informed on him.

The Mentor was busted for breaking into his school to steal 29 computers. Also
it has been said that Poltergeist is in the hospital with leukemia.
It is unknown if any other members were busted for any other reasons. However,
all former members are apparently safe now.

The Bit Blitz and Crustaceo Mutoid are supposedly forming a new group called
Rising Force and The Mentor is starting an elite hacking group.

     Much of this information has been supplied by former Extasyy member:

                                Kleptic Wizard

Legion of Doom Vs. Stronghold East Elite
----------------------------------------
Somehow The Maelstrom found the secret LOD VMS in 305, and decided to post
about it on Stronghold East.  Knight Lightning spoke with Compu-Phreak of the
LOD, and he said that he told Slave Driver, co-sysop of Stronghold East, to
remove all posts concerning the LOD VMS, and the LOD itself.  He also
threatened that failure to do so would bring down the wrath of the 6 most
active members of the LOD.

When last looked at Stronghold East still had the information online.

The LOD VMS has 96 megs online and store information in a way similar to
laserdisc.

All readers are encouraged NOT to call it as Compu-Phreak is getting pissed
and you don't have the passwords anyway.

Dartmouth Abandoned
-------------------
With the destruction of the 58107s 12-27-65 password to the Dartmouth system,
it seems to have been abandoned by phreaks.  This is good because basically it
only causes trouble.  Many users get impersonated on that system and false
rumors are constantly being started.  The best way to have a conference is a
tele-conference...start one today!
