Blow darts are easy to make and all the materials can be found in your own
home. These darts can travel a long distance with good penetration if
constructed correctly.

Materials needed:

A small piece of wood
A sewing machine needle
A spool of thread
A couple nails
Hammer
Glue
Scissors

   Hammer the two nails about two inches apart on the board. Wrap the thread
tightly around the two nails. The number of times the thread is wrapped around
the nails will determine the amount of weight and stability the dart has. Once
you have decided you have wrapped enough thread, cut it close to the nail at
around a half inch. Take this small tuft of thread and put a dab of glue on the
folded end. The kind of glue you use is very important. I suggest that you use
a tacky kind of glue (nothing runny, like Elmer's glue). Attach this to the
needle and hold until it is dry.
   Another kind of dart can be made with Q-tips. This kind of dart doesn't work
as well as the first one, but it is sometimes easier to make. first you have to
get the kind of Q-tips that have a plastic stem. Cut the Q-tip close to one
end. Insert the sewing needle into the Q-tip and secure it by melting the
plastic slightly with a lighter. This kind of dart doesn't last long because
the cotton come off easily.

Blow Guns:

   Ordinary straws make an excellent blow gun with this kind of dart. Another
kind can be made with a cheap pen by taking apart the pen and using the shell.
Any long, cylindrical, object with the diameter of a straw will work very well.
