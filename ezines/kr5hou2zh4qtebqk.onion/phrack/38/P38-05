   +++++ Zamfield's Wonderfully Incomplete, Complete Internet BBS List +++++

FOREWORD
~~~~~~~~
The following list has been compiled with the help of the wonderfully generous
crowd of folks who associate with Internet or UseNet.  I owe them many thanks
and please keep the info coming.

I, and many others, have a few things to say about these BBSes in general.  So
bear with me, or skip ahead, but do take a look later.

1). These BBSes are provided as a service to anyone on Internet.  Not just you.
2). While you may not directly pay for these services someone does.
3). You are a guest, and please keep that in mind while using these BBSes.

Okay, that wasn't so bad after all.

Most of these BBSes offer services unique to BBSing.  Some offer small scale
versions of standard Internet services.  Keep in mind that mail or articles
posted on BBSes do not reach everyone in the world, and if you can get to
UseNet, you will probably find better responses.  Most of the files on these
BBSes can be found by anonymous FTP, so don't tie up the system with files if
you have FTP.  Do be considerate on these BBSes, some people aren't using
telnet or rlogin to get to these, some people still dial numbers with modems at
their homes. :-)

For users of JANET (UK), you may access these BBSes through first connecting to
UK.AC.NFSNET-RELAY.TELNET or PAD.UK.AC.NFSNET-RELAY.TELNET.  Likewise, users of
Internet can get to JANET by telnet SUN.NFS.AC.UK, login as janet.
