Preface
-------

The PC Pursuit outdials, although limited in their dialing range, are of
fundamental knowledge to any X.25 hacker in the world.  Collecting the
addresses of the PC Pursuit outdials is among the first projects of any
hacker new to the X.25 hacking arena.  On and off through the years since
1986 when I first happened upon the X.25 scene, I have been attempting to
compile the complete list of NUAs for all of the outdials.  I still haven't
realized this goal five years later, as can be evidenced by blanks in the
above list.

Other outdials, such as the ones hacked out of explorations of internal
corporate, government, or educational networks, come and go usually as fast
as codes.  Some of these outdials are prize finds that can dial any number
in the world and would supplant the usefulness of this list.  But such out-
dials are normally gone in a matter of weeks.  The ones that do stay around
(such as the infamous 30209160xxxx global outdials) do not work very well.
Of course there are exceptions to every rule.  Some Global OutDials (GODs)
go on working for years, but only because they are known only by one or a
few hackers who don't go around giving it to everyone in hackerdom far and
wide.

The PC Pursuit outdials have been functioning without fail for several years
and will continue to be a reliable and useful hacker's tool for the foreseeable
future.  You can count on them to be there when you need them, especially when
a GOD you've been using fails and you need something to fall back on. I have
put together these two files to help further facilitate your use of the PC
Pursuit outdials.  I hope you find them useful references.

Some Notes for Beginners
------------------------

All the modems that you access on the outdials are of the Racal-Vadic brand
and accept the standard Hayes AT command set as a default.  I will not go
into an explanation of AT commands since you should already know them as a
competent user of your computer and modem.  If not, check your modem's
manual since it is almost certainly a Hayes compatible modem.

The Racal-Vadic modem offers its own command mode as an alternative to the
industry standard Hayes AT command set.  To access the Racal-Vadic mode, type a
CTRL-E and then RETURN.  You will see "READY" and an asterisk for a prompt.
Type "?" for a list of commands.  This mode is more attractive to many users
because of its verbose interface and detailed call progress messages; because
fewer keystrokes are needed to execute commands such as dial, and because of
its ability to redial up to nine times until a connection is made.

None of the outdials allow you to call them collect.  You will have to call
them from either a PAD (Packet Assembler Deassembler) or NUI (Network User
ID).  PC Pursuit IDs can also be used as pseudo-NUIs by typing the NUA
followed by a comma, the PCP ID, another comma, and the PCP Password.  If
you do not already have one, you will have to consult a fellow hacker for a
valid NUI or PAD (not as freely traded nowadays).  Or, to really impress
your hacker friends, hack your own. (Consult other files featured in Phrack
that deal with this subject matter.)

The 12 digit NUA (Network User Address) for each outdial above is for accessing
the outdial from a network other than SprintNet/Telenet.

The shorter five to six digit number below it is for accessing the outdial
from SprintNet/Telenet.  Actually, you can use the 12 digit number as well
as the shorter five to six digit number (if you precede the 12 digit NUA
with a 0) on SprintNet, but the shorter one is easier to remember and use.

For the purposes of memorizing the outdials that you will use more often, it is
a simple matter of remembering the shorter SprintNet address and convert- ing
it to the 12 digit NUA as needed like this:

SprintNet address xxxyyy becomes 3110xxx00yyy (Add 0's in yyy where needed)
EXAMPLE:          813124 becomes 311081300124
EXAMPLE2:         4155   becomes 311041500005 (Add preceding 0's in yyy)

Note that networks usually require you to precede the NUA with a 0 or 1
(usually 0) much like when you dial a long distance phone call.  For
example, on Tymnet, typing an NUA does not require a 0 or 1.  On Canada's
DataPac, a 1 is required before the 12 digit NUA.  On SprintNet and most
European X.25 networks, a 0 is needed.

When you connect with an outdial modem, the first thing you might want to
do is to redial the last number dialed.  The last person who used the modem
might have called a number that would be of interest to you in your hacking
endeavors.  Enter the Racal-Vadic mode and execute the "R" redial command.
The last number dialed is shown on the screen and dialed.  The A/ command
in the Hayes AT command mode won't work for this purpose since the last
number dialed is not shown and the last command executed isn't necessarily a
dialing command.

Unfortunately, when a person exits the outdial, the modem resets itself in
most cases and the last number dialed is lost.  But occasionally you'll get
lucky and find an interesting new number to call

Calling Specific Modems, and GODs (Global OutDials)
---------------------------------------------------

Each outdial has many modems that you can connect to.  When calling the
outdial NUA, you will be connected to the first available modem.  If all
are being used, you will get a busy message.  It is possible for you to
attempt to connect to one particular modem in the series rather than
connect to the first available unused modem.

Append two digits to the end of a NUA to specify which modem you want.
For example, to connect to the third modem on 311061200022, you would
call NUA 31106120002203.  So theoretically, you can call up to 99
different modems on the same outdial (31106120002200 is the same as
311061200022), but no outdials have this many modems.

On SprintNet, you can append a letter to the four to six digit address
to specify a modem.  You can also add a decimal point and then the two
digits for modems above 26 (and below).  For example, 31106120002203 is
the same as 61222C and 61222.03; 31108130012426 is the same as 813124Z
and 813124.26.

So, you may ask, why would I want to call a specific modem?

The reason is that some modems permit unrestrictive dialing.  Such modems
will let you dial ANY number in the world, not just the local numbers
that you're only suppose to call.  Such modems are known as GODs, which
stands for Global OutDial.

GODs don't last forever.  As soon as the SprintNet priests discover the
abuse occurring on a particular modem, they'll fix it.  So you'll have to
talk with your fellow hackers to find out which modems are known to be
GODs, or better yet, scan for your own.

Local Exchange Database
-----------------------

For those using the outdials from international locations, it is important
to note that you cannot call just any number in the same area code as the 
outdial.  Unless you're using a GOD (see part A), you can only dial numbers
local to the city the outdial is in.

At the end of this file you will find a database of all the exchanges (the
three numbers in a telephone number after the area code) that are dial-able
from each outdial.  This database will not only be useful to verify for sure
that you can dial a particular number from a PC Pursuit outdial, but will also
be useful for checking which outdial to use in cases where multiple outdials
can be used to dial different numbers in the same area code.  For example you
can dial numbers in area code 213 from THREE different outdials: 213 CALAN, 818
CAGLE, *and* 714 CASAN.  Unless you are familiar with the geographic dialing
plan of the Los Angeles area, you would have to consult the exchange database
to figure out which outdial to use.

The raw data for the list was downloaded from the PC Pursuit Service BBS
(call collectable from SprintNet at 311090900631, @C PURSUIT or @909631;
logon as "Sprint Guest" with password "outdial").  I made some very time
consuming modifications to the format of the list so that it could be used
effectively with Unix's grep command or MS-DOG's FIND command (and similar
commands on other operating systems).

For example, let's say you wanted to call a BBS at 213-395-0221.  As I
mentioned earlier, there are three different outdials that can dial numbers in
the 213 area code.  You have to find out which one to use.  On Unix, you would
type:

% grep 213 <filename>|grep 395

Or on MS-DOS, you would type:

C:\>FIND "213" <filename>|FIND "395"

where <filename> is the name this file is saved under.  You will then see:
 OB
1 213 CAGLE 393 394 395 396 399 400 413 415 450 451 452 453 454 455 458
  213 CALAN 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400

As you can see, you can call 1-213-395-0221 from two outdials: CAGLE and
CALAN.  But notice that the CAGLE outdial has a 1 in front of it.  This
means that if you use the CAGLE outdial, you will have to dial with the
toll prefix (1) and area code preceding the local number since CAGLE is
in the 818 area code.

Dialing from CAGLE: ATDT12133950221
Dialing from CALAN: ATDT3950221

Conclusion
----------

I could hardly take credit for scanning and finding the NUAs that make
make up this list.  I put this list together because the lists I've seen
in the past were either partially incomplete or partially incorrect.  A
list put out by OpusWiz and Dawn Treader several years ago served as the
base data for this list.  I've spoken to many many hackers over the years
to add to and correct the list.  Erik Bloodaxe's Telenet Directory,
published in the Legion of Doom Technical Journals, was of great help in
clarifying and adding to the data.

The list is still neither complete or fully accurate.  For example, I still
don't know the outdials for San Diego, California (619).  The 415 and 714
outdials might be mixed up.  If you have any additions or corrections, please
e/mail one of my Internet accounts.

By the way, the new 510 area code will have an impact on the PC Pursuit
dialout list.  SprintNet hasn't incorporated the new area code into its
lists yet, so I haven't either.  But they will soon, so be aware that the
Oakland, California dialout will change from area code 415 to 510 someday.
