 Hey, I got the same two posters with the exception of one thing, They say
Spring Break '87 - Daytona Beach. Anyhow, My Easter Sunday went pretty well, I
awoke at about 10am with the sun streaming through the window and trying to
make its way through the beer tower. I rolled over to the sound of the ocean
waves hitting the coast. I got up opened one of last nights beers and walked
out onto the balcony intern seeing a great view of Daytona Beach.  The rest of
the day went pretty much the same way.

   Crax and I were talking about scams today and we came across an interesting

didnt pay for) you can keep it, unless the company decides to pay for its
return or gets it back theirselves. I can understand that most people are not
going to pay to have something shipped back to a company but the idea of
"keeping it" doesnt sound right. Comments?

   Have a question for anyone who grows dope. Someone told me that the pigs
have some kind of radar that they use when flying over the woods, fields..etc,
that supposedly pick up plants that are growing less than two feet from each
other. I dont see how this is possibly at all, but its kind of scary. Also, can
anyone give me some good ideas on how to grow it. I already have about 50
planted that are coming up quite well (Im in the money...!) and I use that shit
they put on fields for fertilizer. I also germinate my seeds by putting them in
wet paper towels in a dark place for a few days before planting them (sprouts
up), about 2 inchs deep in garden soil (that shit you buy at k-mart thats
supposed to be good dirt). That was a lame question, but I need to know...

   Speaking of Phantasie Realm, we changed the format for the last time and it
looks good. New advanced subs, killed all the assholes, lowe red the access of

 I'm sure you have all seen those depth finder things on boats and stuff. Those
things can tell you almost exactly whats underneath. Probably the same type of

Knowing the cops, they probably do have things like that, so they can go out

Nancy Reagan, William Bennett, Rehnquest and O'Connor (the latter two were
appointed Supreme Court justices, screened by Ronald Reagan and Edwin Meese to
make sure they were conservative and conformist enough to the rest of the
senile warmonger's administration). Mor e and more money is being wasted in the
name of their fucking law and order, their fucking 'Christianity', self
righteousness, conservative viewpoints that deny people's civil rights (womens
right to an Abortion, Roe Vs Wade decision, the firing of 1/2 of the Civil
Rights Commission and probably replacing them with Reagan Lovers, and more).
Now the cops will go to exteme lengths (this radar shit and Paraquat poisoning)
to make sure that they can have their fucking recreational drugs which are
perfectly legal while condemning us as criminals for engaging in other
recreational drugs that are less harmful (but ILLEGAL of course, it makes all
the difference. Laws are always right and fair, and manipulative enough by
those in power as a small child would play with Ronald Reagan's shit, smearing
it over the constitution). I can see them also having orgasms and myocardial
infarctions when they find plants they think are cannibussativa, only to find
out they are sewer weeds, things growing from flowing human waste in fields.

14/100: radar
Name: The Prophet 23
Date: 4:15 am  Sat May 02, 1987

I kind of find the radar idea a bit spaced out... After all, if it picked up
pot plants less than 2 feet apart, it would pick up damned near every thing
else less than 2 feet apart. In decent sized forest, this could amount to
quite a bit of garbage... weeds, small trees, etc. The police DO ariel
searches, but I believe (though I'm not sure) that they do it by sight.

They usually do this, though, over state- and company- owned land, as most
dope-farmers, for some reason, don't own their own forest land. I know for a
fact that in my area, they do occasional air searches over some forest land
owned by a paper company, but they don't search the forest behind my house
owned by my grandfather (otherwise I would be in or under a jail cell now).

You don't have to use fertilizer, but the pot will be weak if it's
undernourished. Another thing to remember is not to({use too much fertilizer.
Actually, marijuana is a pretty tough plant, and doesn't really require a
great deal of care. Just water them daily, and plant them somewhere where they
can get plenty of sunlight.

First of all this police drug radar is the most amazing piece of trash gossip I
have ever heard.  Police would have better things to do than go through back
yards with plant radar.  I mean any two objects within 2 feet of each other set
it off... yeah right.  What about patio furniture, what about a backyard grill
and gas tank?  What about shrubs or trees?

Although it does sound 99.99% wrong, that's just the sort of thing the cops
would come up with to act as a deterrent against life. EEEGg.

Two notes of addt'l interest:

-:1- In Virgina Beach, home of the 700 club, it is illegal to imbibe alcohol
     outdoors. So, if someone was having a beer in his fenced in yard, someone
     else could call the cops and say "There's a man drinking beer in his
     backyard.  Please hurry!" and the cops could come and cart him away.

-:2- The latest issue of OMNI has a very fascinating article about the US.
     Military and how they are linked with US communications services (or would
     like to be). Needless to say, you should read it.

-:3- OK, so I forgot one (or I can't count. You be the judge). The latest
     issue of RIP  is the Rock Censorship Issue, and has even MORE fascinating
     articles on the PMRC, the Back In Control punk/metal deprogramming center,
     and much much more. Again, you should read it.

Everytime I read something like this, I go out to the fields and have a
dandelion break. I can't believe stuff like this can happen in America.

Well, I find it very hard to believe that someone could detect such plants
growing so closely together. Secondly, for the outdoor Dope Grower, Simply,
bury some seeds and forget them for a few months. If You plan on indoor
growing, You have to understand that Dope is a Weed, so that they don't really
need sunlight, and would grow in virtually any environment. If you want an
indoor garden, spend a few bucks and get a hydrpod setup(Articles in
High-Times) and buy a "Grow and Show" light. I have heard that if you crush up
Quaaludes and use them as fertalizer, you will come out with some heavy dope.

Just remember that germination is a BIG key in getting something decent. Yes, I
have grown some in my basement, it wasn't THAT good, but the price was
right.....

Cannabis (sp?) is a weed and can grow anywhere.  However for the best potency,
good sunlight, water, and fertilizer is needed.  Soaking the seeds for a few
days in drenched paper is good before planting, just to get the sprouts going.

I don't know about that plant detection nonsense, but I do know that you can
get capital punishment for selling pot in school. (Thanks Nancy, you
dragon-witch)

The other day, I read on the back of a coffee can, "Say no to drugs." What
hypocrosy, no? Caffeine is a much more abused drug and more addictive
(according to many sources), than a pure 100% natural bowl of grade-a herb.
Everything is a drug in America:Nicotene, caffeine, money, power, etc.. (uh

Considering police radar detects the speed of moving objects, the same
technique is used for alarm systems, it doesnt care about the speed though,
just if something is moving, thats why radar detectors often go off around
stores, I dont know how it would detect plants two feet apart.  What do they
set the PSD plant spacing detector to 2 feet?  Or do the plants run around
when noone is looking?

Does a tree that falls in a forest with noone to hear it or record it mae any
noise?

Why can you see?

thats so expensive, and time consuming though. Usually what they did where I
was living was just cruise over the mountians/wooded areas, and If youveever
seen a pot plant, usually the color gives them away.. I have 12 plants in my
closet, each about 1' 1/2" tall, which I have had 1 1/2 months... Use miracle
gro fertilizer. this is best, because it wont burn the plants, as you cannot
use too much.. also, you definetly dont want to get males and females mixed
up. the females will have a short growth at the bottom of the stem as they
mature, which, when broken off will grow right back where it was. I have heard
of people grafting hops onto plants, and this served an excellent disguise,
but where can ya get hops??

 I'm concerned for our countries future. Right-wingers and conservatives are

'When a student picks up a math book, he reads that there are no absolutes.
The next thing you know, he turns to crime and drugs.'

 Now, that takes the cake for being the most foolish, scatterbrained, lame
attempt to support your views. But, they have the money, funded by Falwell and
Robertson, who dupe consumers into sending them money so they will 'go to
heaven' and have 'the lord's blessing'.  'Most people are assholes' (name of a

the female plant are much stronger than those of the male plant. By the way,
who uploaded the file, "drug800s.txt", what the hell are those pills being
sold (never heard of D&E's before...), and what's the address to order them?

Anyone who wants to know where the country's heading in the future need do
nothing more than look at the heart of the Southern Baptist Bible Belt, North
Carolina. The new obscenity law states that "mature adults have no right to
possess obscene material". X-rated movies are now illegal here, and possession
of an obscene magazine, even if you only read it in the privacy of your own
home and are over 21, is punishable by a heavy jail sentence and fine.

'CUT THE CRAP' AND *DO* SOMETHING!

My god, I just love to see all these phreaks post about how terrible the right
wing is and how they should all go to hell and they sound real tough but 'Lets
take a look at the record'.  Remember the Falwell Game?  And then the Pat
Robertson game?  It was where you dialed Fallwell or Pat's 800  and then
hung up after a couple seconds, making them have to pay a $1 or so.  Phreaks
were the perfect people to do it, programs + knowledge, but NOOOOOO, a few did
it for a couple of days but they, hell YOU, were tooo fucking lazy to actually
do shit.  It was people who had to hand dial all the time who did 90% of it.

What politial commitment.  Oh yeah, when Libya was bombed the outrage on
phreak boards was just tremendous, why I think I saw 1 post against it.  Its
not until they start doing something that directly affects you (drugs, etc)
that you get off your ass.

OK, now a response from me would be the normal thing to do now and Im a normal

What do I do 'constructive'?  I call up my congressman, I write my
congressman/representatives.  Your normal stuff.  Then, I go to
demonstrations, try to contribute to alternative newspapers,
draw/write/paint/scriblle thousands of anarchy symbols around the bay area to
'spread the word'.  I try to keep in contact with other radical organisations
to contribute my time etc.  Example I have done volunteer work for a small

quite a bit on things like that (In mainstream papers and underground
alternatives like Socialist Labor Party newsletter,SANE mag, The St. Louis
Arms Freeze forecast letter, People for the American Way, etc.). However I

and currently that includes myself.  Also, we would never have enough support
in any one are to win any form of election but a lobbyist organization seems
feasible.  But you all know as well as I do that this will NEVER happen.

53/100: Politics
Name: Doom Prophet 21

Well, who knows. I'm sure there will always be good phreaks around. I will be
doing less of course (Graduation, College, Work, etc) but that's no big loss.

About political classifications, I liked the Nolan chart much better than
traditional Left-Right wing grouping. Most people take left to mean communist
and opposed to personal freedom. Some of the more famous left wing (radicals)
are the Black Panthers from the late sixties, and others that I won't mention.
Right wing conservative policies generally seem to be more realistic (but of
course because they side with the current system and don't support radical
change as left wing does). I think we do need change to prevent America from
becoming a cesspool of violence, money, racism, and exploitation of both
people and the environment (it's like that now though depending upon your
viewpoint). It's a difficult question, because the root of the system is
people-people with stubborn entrenched attitudes. How are we going to change
the entire system if we can't change ourselves and others around us? Impose a
law? That would be fascist. In my opinion, freedom of expression and action
should be allowed so long as it's not causing harm or violence toward the
innocent (or the not so innocent). The Libertarian party summed it up quite
well..but a political party doesn't make a perfect system.
To change the topic slightly, what do you feel about our actions (fraud,
breaking and entering, etc) as far as morality (flexible and sometimes useless
term) and justice? (That sounds corny but I don't know how else to word it).

Yeah well, what I was trying to say is that with college in the fall and the
quite often occurence of 950 blocking from college campuses, a new area to have
to scan for Telenet dialups or whatever and in general, I fell that as a
whole, the phreak community will suffer greatly.  Lets face it, there will
continue to be a phreak community, but as I see it, today's phreaks,
specifically those on this system or Catch have reached the highest plateau in
the area of knowledge ever in the history of our community.  This is not to
say that it will never be surpassed, but somehow with more and more security
involving itself in our affairs and the decline of interest I feel that this
is the golden age and it will start to fall back until a new era begins many
years from now.

The community will continue to exist no matter what, even if for no better
reason than the rodent wares kids or the habitual code abusers.

As far as morality, I don't feel too concerned about it although I do believe
it to be wrong.  I try not to think about it too much.  However, when the
government or Reagan can make deals with terrorist and lose millions of
dollars or throw it away, I don't feel to guilty about making illegal calls.
Its all in how you rationalize it.

realize the extent of the illigal-ness of the activity that you are doing.

KL-I'm still working on that "Laws of preaking....." stuff that we talked
about, while reading over old notes, etc, it can make you realize what you are
"up against" if you are caught.  Basically, your screwed if an adult.  For the
most part you are seeing about 30 days jail time, full restitution, and
assorted court costs.  Not a good time.   I was wasted a few nights ago and
debated calling up a LD company and telling them that I had hacked EVERY code
they had, and would sell them the code file for $1000, else turn the file

    Face it folks. Were heading down the long road to communism. Our leaders
are pretty much all corrupt. I think our country stinks. And I think in a
few years the "kiddies" will feel the same. Face it, we talk about anti-drug
bullshit, and all this anti-that and anti-this, but our leaders are setting
a great example to the future leaders of our country, arent they? This country
is headed anywhere but uphill, and I hope I die before it all falls to
peices. Im old enough to vote, but chose not to and never will. I dont care
about politics even though I should. Id rather not take a small part in the
downfall of the good ole US of A. I dont follow politics, and I dont watch

..(sorry, double cr) the news. Why? Because its all BAD thats why. Anyway, I
hope to enjoy my life to the fullest without worrying about stupid shit, like
Reagan and his scams. One thing that does piss me off is this big drug war.
Its alot of nonsense if you ask me. The people that end up fucking up there
lives are the people who have no sense and get burnt on heavy drugs (Coke,
LSD...etc) and they end up either dead, dying, fucked up or trying to
rebuild there lives. Needless to say, they forgot about having a good time.
They got addicted. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Cmon folks, wake up...whats life
about? Having a good time and living the fullest and richest (I sound like
an ad for Folgers) life you possibly can Killing yourself isnt the
answer. I know, Im rambling on. Oh well. About this phreak war thing, we
all know its bullshit. Ifthe phreaks did unite (something pretty much
impossible - will never happen), who do you think would win? The government
or the phreaks? Even if we didnt get caught, we would still lose. The
puppet-masters have our senile president right where they want him, and
no matter who does what, they can keep them there for as long as they
wish. (At least til the end of his term, anyway). Its a suicide mission.
It cant be won. No one will ever be powerful enough to take on our government.
No one but non-americans would aid him, and theres too many people afraid
of the "bomb" for that too happen. So all we could do is piss them off, thus
giving them an even better reason to exterminate us all. Anyway, thats about
all I have to say on the matter(s).

Name: Lex Luthor 36
Date: 10:02 am  Fri May 15, 1987

Getting back to that "golden age" deal, well I am sure there will be a time
when more and more things will be networked, but saying they will have all this
security and tracing shit is ridiculous. There will always be bugs and holes to
be exploited, and security always comes last for everything. The only people
who think security should come first are the ones whose job is security. Making
products, consulting, etc. Everyone else puts security low on the list. It will
probably remain that way indefinitely. Look at the show Max Headroom. I think
it is one of the best shows on TV. A lot of people don't like it. They don't
understand it. Sure some things are a bit ridiculous like the old-style
typewriter keys used for computer keyboards, but basically the show is quite
interesting. It appears that just about everything in existance is networked in
some way to some central processor. Every building, and everything within those
buildings are networked. Ang gaining access to the network, allows you to gain
access to just about anything, assuming you can defeat any security involved. I
like the show mainly due to the security and insecurity involved. They are
constantly breaking the security on everything.

The show probably is based on some variation of the future, and it does show
that no matter how sophisticated things get, there always will be ways around
it. Having the ability to defeat these controls, allows you to have control
over your own destiny as far as concepts of 'big brother' are concerned.

If the government turned into the big brother depicted in 1984, I am sure
those "good enough" would not be as affected. They would simply find ways to
get around controls and modify or neutralize anything that was threating to
them.

Since everyone has been rambling, I thought I would ramble some too.

I also have to disagree with your first comment.  Just because everyone is
going to college does not mean we will loose that many people.  When I left
about 2 years ago, I still tried to call here as much as I could.  Taran (or
Knight) did bring up a good point about college systems getting smarter but if
you go to a college that is good enough to have phones in each of the dorms (or
if you live in an apartment) then most of the time you don't have a thing to
worry about.

basicaly agree with it.  Sure some people will keep being involved but most
wont have the time, equipment, and the fact that they will no longer be treated
as a minor by the law will act as a detriment.  (no that sentence wasnt
constructed right...)

Yow Lex...Cyberpunk for ever...Speaking of which (this belongs on the phrack

connect us to 314-070-1000.  Bill said that he was priveledged and that he had
to speak to his brother in the post office.  When we thought the 0perator had
left the line, Bill proceded to simulate an 800 DA ring with his lips. When the
operator came on, he asked for the first company with Banana in its name and we
were given Banana Educational Software and cracked up.  We were hooked up to a
recording.  After the recording said 800-328, the operator came on and said she
was reporting this line.  She said she has had previous accounts... The
operator then paused and said, "Yes, yes I'd like a trace.  The number is
314-432-0756, good you traced it."  She then proceeded to access another loop
and keep us on hold for several minutes.  Oh, forgot a part.  After she finally
consented to connect the number, Bill said that she could go, and she says,
"No, I want to hear this!" and then she became silent until she started being
rude and decided that she was working for the FBI and set up a trace.

ANYWAY, after being put on hold for a few minutes, she came back and we
requested the supervisor and she wouldn't give her to us.  We eventually got
dropped.  We couldn't even file a complaint because we didn't have her fargin'
name.  I say we kill her.  I say we hang her, then we kill her.  I say we
tattoo her, then we scorch her, then we hang her, and THEN we kill her.

Yes that is correct, as many of us get older, the laws surrounding us are due
to change will will affect our outlook as to just how important the phreak/hack
community really is to us.  Some of the people that feel threatened may start
paying for calls rather than phreak, but this then gets expensive.

Furthermore, in college, there is most liklely little time for this.  Now Lex
may disagree becuase his exsperience may be a bit differenet, but he also takes
anout a month or more off between calls here.  In reference to Cheap Shades, he
ran Metal Shop AE here in StL.  Then off to college, he brought the computer
and put up QuickShop.  However, he had little time to use it and the necesssity
to use his only voice line (the bbs line) came up more and more often.
Eventually he just took it down and he doesn't call anywhere.

made that up recently). I followed it in the papers also, it was interesting
to see something like that happen. The CIA have not stopped with Nicaragua,
but now we have dragged Honduras, Mexico, Isreal, and other countries in our
feud with the Sandinistas, along with CIA/DEA dealings involving drug smuggling
to fund the Contras.

While we're on this topic, I just read an article in  Reader's Digest that
basically called the nuke freeze movement communist and corruptive. He had
some good points however, which only goes to show that both the U.S. and Russia

   The Iraq accident may be real.  The ship didn't have any defences ready.
Now they tell us it was 2 assault missiles. There is not much Reagan can do.
He can't punish them, they get nothin g major from us.  Reagan made a good
decision on the Libyan deal, he's don e his job.  How many terrorist have
screwed with Americans lately?  Not many.

First of all accidental or not, it shouldn't have happened.  Secondly the
captain of the ship did have permision to fight back. It was under attack. The
captain just didn't switch from automatic to manual soon enough to shoot
anything.  Thirdly, the plane was American made and the missle was French
(like SFD said), they have that shit because we support Iraq's side in this
Iraq vs Iran war.  We could easily punish Iraq for what they did but then we'd
lose our initial investment in their struggle.

Hmm..on Libya, the press releases from the White House were lies. Khadafy
didn't threaten us with further terrorism, the U.S. used his country for a
scapegoat for the American people. However, the disinformation was vastly
underplayed in the very same news we were brainwashed with. A lot of papers and
news media is owned by large corporations. Do you want the businesses that
caused an invasion of Cuba in this century to put thoughts into your head? So
the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 79. But of equal tyranny was thte U.S.
foreign policy toward Cuba (since our business is threatened by Castro we will
make war and the excuse will bbe we were fighting communism) earlier on. So
both of the superpowers suck. Now we have to support another war. How long
will it be before we are having Blood and Guts rambozos like Ollie North
running around in a mess of secret things 'to protect our national interest'.

America wants oil, to get it, it needs puppets
So what's 10 million dead if we're keeping out the Russians?

i just found out how to beat a videogame called Galaga the other day.  If you
leave the bottom left bee-like creature alone on the first 'stage' and let it
swoop by for about 10 minutes, eventually it will stop shooti ng at you.  at
that point you can kill it, and for the rest of the game, nothi ng will shoot
at you.  kind of interesting.  i've found alot of odd 'bugs' in video-games
over the years (tempest, defender etc)..  although i don't spend too much time
playing them, i like hearing about these things. anyone give a hoot, or shall
we go back to discussing CAMA tapes (by far the more important to me, ahem)..
or is it AMA tapes...  who cares.

  k

ps: anyone still prefer a decent pinball game to video games these days?

A neat video game I saw was called "Contra", really fast and furious, also a

fast, but I still prefer the video game if and when i drop by an arcade.

What can you do with Tempest?  I have the actual game at home, about the only
thing that I have ever found is that on some settings you can press the player
one button and you can jump to the next level....

I prefer pinball since most videogames are too slow for me. Pinball can be
quick and keeps me interested. High-Speed is one of the better games.

Most people know that on Defender after you reach 990,000 every thing you hit
gies you a free guy up until 1 million when it "rolls over" to 0 again. You
don't receive new guys again until the last of your men are used up. It is
recommened to not use that many smart bombs during this time and let the guys
die. If you can get to a million then you should never have to worry about not
being able to get free men. Personally I think defender is one of the best
games of all time, since it has all the action I need. Asteroids Deluxe, the
hard one is a good game, just you can't find it anymore.




92/100: Gauntlet
Name: Slave Driver 58
Date: 9:10 am  Fri May 29, 1987


 and Gauntlet II are two very good games if you have 4 people that know how to
play the thing.  Galaga is a very good game, but my personal favorite is Qix,
yes, I know thats sad, but hey...

 On that Stark thing, the reason they didnt have that defense system on auto is
as follows.  First of all it uses extremely hig density lugs weighing 30 lbs
and shoots 3,000 a minute.  It uses radar to track the thing in and just blasts
the shit out of it.  The problem is, anything of any decent size with radar
would get the shit blown out of it, its not selective.  I dont think it would
be too nice to be coming in in a little helicopter (sp?) and have this thing
shoot 3000 rounds a min at you.  Something like that could ruin your day...

  The Exocet the missle that hit them| travels several hunderd miles an hour at
a distance of 8 feet from the water.  Neithers the AWACS nor the ship detected
the launch on radar, although the ship detected Radar Lock always a sign of
agression.  They did not know the thing was coming till they spotted it
visually.  By the time word got to the Information Center, they had 7 seconds
to respond... oh well...

Sorry, U2's music was good, but the concert wasnt that great.  But I guess you
had to go to a lot of previous concerts to know that...

98/100: tempest and things..
Name: Kerrang Khan 34
Date: 12:37 pm  Mon Jun 01, 1987

the low down on tempest -

first you have to play normally until you reach the red V shaped level.
when you reach the one after that (a square-ish V) you can die or (read
on)

you have to get a score over 170,000 for this bug to work (the red V's bonus is
something like 180k so its easier to just die and play a new game.  in order to
get 170k+ on one quarter requires you get up into the yellow levels which is
kind of tough).  anyway, once you have 170,000 plus point the key is to get the
last two digits of your score to a specific number and then just die.  you can
jump your score by two points by shooting 'spikes' and by one point for
finishing off a spike (you work it out).

some interesting two digit numbers are

12, 17 - 40 free credits
05     - dumps you into playing the attract mode (more on this)
00     - freeze game in attract mode
01     - reset game (puts you into the maint. screen)
46     - changes level you can start at.
48     - lots and lots of 'ships' (mode on this too).

you set up your score and die, then wait for the game to cycle through
the attract mode, and then things will happen.  17 just starts adding credits
and you can play normally, but you can have much more fun with 05. this just
dumps you into the game tempest will be playing with itself. at this point, ALL
the strange things you can trigger off will go on while you are playing.  if
you can hit 48 your ships will start multiplying, up to about 255 (guess), and
if you can do this, you hit 01 and wait after which your game will 'normalize'
and you can play all day to some outrageous high score.  if you hit 00 though,
the xDgame will freeze up on you.  anyway thats a rough outline, and it only
works on older versions. how did you get your own tempest machine DJ?

  k

highspeed isnt a game, its a way of life.

The game allows you to sit down and get a stereo sound with the whole machine
moving with you.  Such as a car would do.

   As for U2 concert....I'm still waiting for it to hit MN.  Idol was great.
So was the Cult.
