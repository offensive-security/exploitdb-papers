1/27: CAROT/RC-MAC
Name: Phantom Phreaker 46
Date: 2:46 am  Sun Apr 26, 1987

  The numbers before/after CAROT are the generic and version.. for instance
2CAROT3 is CAROT 2, generic 3. The highest I have seen is 2CAROT4, but there
are probably more. Also a number that refers to a CAROT system could also be
it's particular number, if there is more than one in a particular area.

  RC-MAC (Recent Change Memory Administration Center) is a place where a clerk
enters information into an electronic switching system via a Recent Change
terminal. The information changed can be a variety of things, but things like
Class of Service, CCF's, EA Interlata Carriers (called a PIC, Primary
Independent Carrier, I believe, something along those lines), etc. Data that
is to perform Recent Changes upon an ESS switch is screened by a computer
system called RMAS (Remote Memory Administration System) for validity. RMAS is
generally running under a unix OS.


 A few actual Recent Changes look something like this:

RC:LINE;CHG:
ORD XXXXXXX
TRC
!

 That is an RC upon a line, to change something. The TRC is TRaCe, I think,
and the ! is needed for some reason.
 You can also have:

RC:MLHG;CHG: (RC upon a Multi Line Hunt Group); RC:MPTY;TWPTY: (RC upon a
Multi Party line, a 2 party line)

 Oh yeah, those examples I typed in might be wrong, I don't memorize them or
anything so don't sue me if they aren't right. Also they are for a 1AESS.

 (Sorry to post two in a row...)

Hatter, RC-MAC does have COSMOS access, at least they have a login prefix
assigned as 'RECENT CHANGE', which is RCxx, where the xx is two numbers. Theyy
don't seem to logged on that often though. Some other systems they may have
access to include RC/V, Recent Change annd Verify, I don't understand RC/V
that much, but RC/V has channels into electronic offices, just like RC
channels. RMAS is access to an RC channel.

 PS-I'm open for corrections..I'm not 100% sure about all this shit either.

Try your CO (they would know if a DNR was there of course), or for CLID marked
numbers, your SCC switch controller. They won't always read you the CT06
though (heh)..

The Recent Change Memory Administration Center is the place at which orders
are put in to do changes to subscriber lines, etc.  It is a very useful
office, but this all depends on what you want to get done.  I believe they
have access to RC terminals (makes sense anyway...) so you could get then to
complete any RC transaction that you wished to have done provided that you've
got a good excuse.  Hope that helps a bit..

8/27: CT reports
Name: Control C 8
Date: 9:07 pm  Wed May 06, 1987

Here's something you may be intrested in:

Report   Reason for Report
------   -----------------
CT01     To print information pertaining to a line trace requested by an input
         message.

CT02     To indicate that this message contains information pertaining to a
         line trace requested by an input message.

CT03     To indicate that an interoffice or outgoing seven-digit call has been
         placed form a directory number to another directory number.

CT04     To indicate that the incoming call has been placed to the indicated
         directory number from a trunk.  The trunk network number (TNN) is
         given.  Translation information for the called directory number or
         the terminating directory number indicated that a trace should be
         made of all calls to this number.

CT05     Indicates thatan outgoing ten digit call has been placed from
         directory number to another directory number.  A check of the
         Calling Line Identification (CLID) list indicates that a trace of
         all calls to this ten-digit number should be made.

CT06     To print the contents of the CLID list in response to input message
         CI-LIST or as the result of an error being detected in a CLID entry
         by audit 32. The audit will remove the directory number in which the
         error was found.  If CLID list in printed in responce to a TTY
         message, then it will be a priority of SCHED and an 'A' will print
         out with the header.  If CLID list is printed as a result of an error
         found by the audit an 'M' will print out with the header since it
         will be a priority of MAN.

If anyone want to know any other output reports let me know..

9/27: SCCS
Name: Mad Hatter 51
Date: 11:18 am  Thu May 07, 1987

What is the difference between SCCS and TSPS SCCS?  Is it that TSPS SCCS is
used by TSPS only?  That sounds logical, but I wasn't sure anyway.  Anyone
ever hear of Network Administration?  What are they good(used) for?

Questions, questions, questions....

10/27: NAC/CT0X reports
Name: Phantom Phreaker 46
Date: 10:58 pm  Thu May 07, 1987

  Network Administration is also known as the NAC, Network Administration
Center, also called Dial Assignment. They are located in the BOC building, I
believe, along with the LAC (Loop Assignment Center) and SSC (Special Service
Center) and a few others. The NAC basically deal with new lines being put in,
they do things like figure out how to evenly distribute the number of lines so
there won't be any shortage, and things like that, it's similar to the LAC but
I don't know any big differences in the two right now.

  Ctrl C, where did you get the CT0X message summaries? Pretty good info
though, but I can say that I have only seen a CT06 (when I pulled it up), a
CT04, and a CT03 message. CT04 ID's a TNN (as he said) connected through the
destination ESS to a particular DN. It can then be determined the general area
of where the call is coming from from the TNN. But there is differences if you
are calling over interoffice trunks (local calls) or tandem trunks, or long
haul, or inter-LATA...

11/27: Offices, systems
Name: Doom Prophet 21
Date: 5:21 pm  Tue May 12, 1987

Ok, for all you D00ds, here's some really hot classified information on Telco
offices and the systems they use for maitenance functions. If you run into a
problem engineering, simply say you are from any of the following offices. I
will go into a brief description of each below. Enjoy!


FUCK-Facilities Utilization Control Kitchen. A really hot office. They keep
backups of all systems per a LATA, or in special cases, the entire BOC area,
along with user logs and passwords. They use the CUNTLICK system to interface
with SHIT, explained momentarily. They ar difficult to reach as no one knows
their number, and anyone calling it has to enter a special queue dispenser
where he enters routing information to reach the FUCK ACD. The FUCK
technicians answer as normal subscribers and you have to tell them a codeword.

PENIS-Plant Engineering Network Information System. Used by the PMS to deal
with outside plant details and layout maps.

CUNTLICK-Computer Utilities Network In the Control Kitchen. Used to sensor
with SHIT.

SHIT-Supreme Hardware Inventory Totals. Self explanatory.

CRAP-Customer Repair Analysis Service. They use PENIS to supply PMS with info.

PISS-Primary Intertoll Switching Servicemen. Corrdinate classes 1 through 4
toll offices and monitor the STP's.

BITCH-Building Installation Table Channel. Used by SHIT technicians to obtain
new switch and office status.

SCAB-Switching Cable Analysis  Burea. They work with PMS for trunk testing and
maintenance. The systems they use are FART and DOPAMINE.

Well, that's about all! Oh, don't forget BASTARD (Box Accessible System To Aid
Real D00ds).  A special in band NPA with full OSC support for blue boxers to
experiment within legally (only operating in special areas).

That's all! Hope it helped!!!1

 You forgot a few:

DOGSHIT-Division Operations Group SHIT (see above post). DOGSHIT is like SHIT,
except that DOGSHIT is in a division.

CATPISS-Centralized Automatic Tandem Priorities Interexchange Support System.
Self-explanitory.

BEER-Bell Electrical Engineering Research

COOL-Computerized Operations On Loops

13/27: Yet still more...
Name: Taran King 1
Date: 8:58 pm  Tue May 12, 1987

Hey now, hey now, that was sheer incompetence...leaving out the following!

BOOGER - Bell Operational Office for Generation of ESS Reports.  Self
Explanitory

STAN - Spanish Tacos And Nachos.  This support group, Californian based,
maintains food services for all superior employees (all employees).

NATE - Nacho And Taco Emissary.  This department secretly interfaces STAN with
the rest of the network due to the STAN group's inability to fit in with
society.  **Due to divestiture, NATE and STAN are no longer part of the
network**

IL DUCE - Not an acronym, but the janitorial services department of the
network.

PUMPKIN - Peripheral Unit Modulator Phor Kitchen Installations of NATE.  This
group is in charge of interfacing kitchen activities through Project Genesis.
See RAPE.

BRRR-RING - The official word for the sound an AT&T phone makes receiving an
incoming call.

BANANA - Basic Analog Network Analog Network Analog (No wonder they went
digital!!!).

RAPE - Red Afro-PUMPKIN Enthusiast.  This group, led by Peter, cheers IL DUCE
while he sweeps the floors.

SCOOP - Secondary Command Output Only Procedure.  This converts all text to
lower case.  It is a function used in most Bell computers along with LEX.

LEX - Lengthy Explanitory Xlations.  This program, found alongside SCOOP,
converts all lowercase text, from SCOOP, into upper case and 40 columns
surrounded by "$"s.

** Warning!  Never leave SCOOP and LEX running simultaneously or you will
surely cause L666 to occur. **

L666 - The warning message generated by computers indicating endless Loops of
conflicting jobs.  This also indicates that everything is fucked.  See LOKI.

LOKI - Life Over-Kill Inscentive.  If you find this error message on your
computer, do not reboot the computer, but be sure to reboot something (HINT
HINT!).

A Dumb Question:
 Is there anyway that you can do anything to 800 numbers? I.e. MB's, etc.
 Can you CNA an 800 Watts or do you have to locate their regular number(Should
they have one). I ask this because Fallwell shoudl burn!

I imagine that you would have to get the POTS number from X-tended 800
services and then get the SCC for the POTS... Maybe the 800 number could be
taken down for a while or disconnected by getting the AT&T office that handles
800 maintainence...

   I don't know if I posted this or not, but not all 800 numbers terminate in
a POTS number, some of them are in the format of (NPA)+1XX+XXXX, and these are
the kind that are only dialable via the actual 800 number, or by someone using
a blue box to trunk off a number within an NPA (toll office actually) that is
subscribed to that 800 number. I had someone get me some translations once
from a toll office in 617, you can get them by typing certain commands
directly into the switch, something like:

TEST-DSIG-INWATS-NPA NXX XXXX. ^D

 That's not right, but it's close.

23/27: NSAC...?
Name: Phantom Phreaker 46
Date: 9:38 pm  Tue May 19, 1987

 Did you mean NESAC by any chance? I've never heard of NSAC but it probably
exists, there are a bunch of telco offices that end in 'SAC' such as MSAC,
ESAC, NESAC, and OSAC, and probably others I can't remember. I'll look around
and see if I can find NSAC anywhere.

Phantom





24/27: Offices
Name: Doom Prophet 21
Date: 6:57 am  Fri May 22, 1987

Well Phantom, OSAC isn't a Bell or AT&T office, it is a system for operator
services support (I guess it stands for something like Operator Services
Assistance Center). From there a person can get information for certain time
periods on entire TSPS sites, such as how many calls were placed, etc,  and a
traffic analysis for day or night reports. The CLLI code is listed with the
report I believe.
CMAC is similar to RC-MAC (or so I thought) because when I was trying to get
an 800 translation, the PBX attendant at the RTM in 312 referred me to them.
They then asked me what switch it was for (the Xlation) and apparently
misundererstood my request (I guess they thought I was asking for a DN or
trunk translation). MSAC is for installation and testing of WATS lines butt
don't give out Xlations (policy by the sound of it although it was probably
just me).  I have heard differently, soo I'm not sure on tht last one (MSAC's
purpose, which I have been told NSAC does instead). Since 800's have gottenen
'advanced' I suppose the  offices for testing could be on a national level,
although MLT equipment when testing a number that has been reported as an 800
somehow accesses the actual translation  or non standard BTN automatically.
The A8FSC probably does WATS testing also, along with NASCAR (mainly used for
traffic analysis from toll centers of 800 terminations to make sure the
completion level is up to standard). TK, where is the ACP physically,  just in
the 4E itself? Do you know how the NCP receives incoming messages (the same as
an initial message on CCIS, or CCS) and in what format? Also, what data links
run to and from the NCP? Hope someone can answer my questions..

To leave another post, but before anyone starts having a fit, I know the
standard  places for obtaining Translations, so please don't leave a thousand
corrections on how the RTM has nothing to do with Xlations (I agree). Acttualy
it was someone at the RWC who referred me to CMAC and not the RTM, I can't
remember clearly anyway.
