St. Louis - Well, the SummerCon has come and gone and nothing has changed.
It started off well, with almost 80 people arriving.  We knew something was
wrong when people wouldn't put nametags on becuase they were embarresed. And
then when they all drank large amounts of beer, it was realised "Hey! These
phreaks arn't any differnt!  There just typical teenagers who beli eve being
drunk is fun 'cause the rest of the time they feel so shitty.  No one was
busted, the police just felt sorry for the weak attempt at Dyonisiun excess.
Oh well, maby someday people will realise that false bravado and bragging of
inebriation is simply stupid.

"Hey, that wasn't even funny."

Hey SFD, you need to title those articles remember?  But seriously, SummerCon
will undoubtably be a quite fun activity but lets face it, no one is going to
learn much about phreaking or hacking that weekend, not with all the excitement
of meeting new people and partying, which kinda relates that you'll forget
everything anyway.

Phreak World Crippled; SummerCon Causes Despair            June 22, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Today the phreak world was astounded and dealt a horrifying blow as all the
phreaks who attended summercon, left with their entire phreak knowledge
literally erased from their minds due to an excess of drinking and other
unknown mind altering substances.  it is unknown as to if these effects are
temporary or a lifetime destruction.

According to Rebel, Howie was busted, went to court and when his mother found
out what he was doing (again) she completely and foreverly (bros?) took away
his phone privelidges. I dont know about that...but oh well. I also heard from
quite a few people who have met Exy, Delta-Master and Bill from RNOC in person

Broadway is being banned from using the community rooms.  If he goes, he will
have to get his own, and I heard that this is what he claimed he would do if he
went.  I really don't think there is going to be any busts as long as no one
brings anything real illegal, like a blue box or is standing down at the pay

that more than 1 minor gets busted. I think we should all find some park or
something. Actually, the better thing to do (which wont and probably cant be

schtuff.  A LOT of people are getting their own rooms so that they won't be
stranded in the middle of nowhere if they get kicked out.  We will just have to
keep it moderated (not the drinking, just the noise).  If you (you) know that
you're getting down here by some manner, please leave feedback saying what form

I'm glad that someone has a dissenting opinion on the drinking scene. While I
do like to drink (on an average of about maybe 1 or 2 times a month, unless
parents are gone or something), I also think that bragging about drugs and
alky takes/shows no intelligence, and the person who refrains from doing that
is a non-conformist. A bunch of people at my school call me 'the Anti-Pot
Crusader' and similar names because I dislike hearing about how fucking drunk
and stoned, etc, everyone got over the weekend for 2 hours straight. But tht
doesn't mean I think it's wrong (unless someone is abusing, etc, selling shitt
to buy drugs). You could take myy messsage as being a 'conformist' drinking/etc
post since I stated some things about TK being drunk and pu king, but I don't
consider it that myself.

Oh, ok Randy, you can sleep in the same room with Broadway.  Don't bend over
for the soap.

Forest Ranger did make some comments and so did Taran on Atlantis.  We have to
remember the saftey of the people going and without sounding crude, the
question of Broadway's sexual preference has never been answered conclusively.
There are several people who plan to attend that would be very concerned about
their personal well-being if they were forced to room with Broadway and I think
that it would just make things simpler if B-way grabbed his own room.

against him, and that is his bullshit story about a year ago when he to ok
Radio Station down, and I believed him like a fool and took my board down and

If the guy shows up, then he shows up.  You can't make plans around him.

As for partying, if you wanna get smashed drunk and make a fool out of
yourself, go ahead.  I'll drink, but drink moderately (about 6 beers/Hour).
As for trading info, or getting busted; DON'T bring anything REAL illegeal.
Others have said this, and I hope that nobody blows it for the rest of us.

About the drinking age: as long as you stay in the damn room and drink, and
keep somewhat quiet, there should be very little of a problem.  For buying
booze, I should be able to buy (even though) I'm not old enough,  because
I'm big enough..   I think TK is a witness to that.    Moosehead!

he met Cap N Crax who met Broadway and Cao said he was ok, but I remember many
others like Monty Python who met him and told us all about how Broadway just
wanted to wrestle him in people's lawns and get him drunk. Will SummerCon
finally answer the question?

As I have stated before, DO NOT bring BLUE BOXes or anything else.  DO NOT
bring a 125 page list of SPC, MCI, MEtro, and TMC codes, DO NOT bring firearms
or knives (Scan man will have that part covered), DO NOT bring your mom, DO NOT
bring the police, DO bring your toothbrush.

bluntly refusing many times, to no avail, I said to myself, "To get this fuck
off my back I will meet him somewhere in the city."  He never showed up. And
stopped calling. But frankly, I believe every negative rumor about him.  I am
convinced h e is an utter fag of the worst kind.  You would too if you heard
the kind of shit he was saying.  He asked questions his gynecologist wouldn't

getting "kicked in the balls" and shaving pubic hair. There is definately
something wrong with him. I remember about 3 years ago when some friends of

supervision.  90% wont be able to handle it and will just run around the hotel
fucking things up.  I had experience with this once and we totally fucked up
the hotel.  We took apart most of the insides of the elevator, broke all the
screens and threw them down 10 floors etc.  And this was just a piece of shit
hotel.  You guys are going to be in a mostly business man type of place. .. and
they wont wait 1 sec to complain.  All in all I would be VERY careful... I also
wouldnt sign my name to the room. At the place I was stay it was a school trip
to Six Flags, Great Adventure| staying the school got a bill for $4000 and that
damage was done by about 15 people.  So whoevers name is on the room

Hmm, one thing I found trashing quite awhile ago was a report by Pac-Bell on
problems they were having with their new DMS-100's...One thing was the "coin
problems"...Ill quote the letter as its fairly interesting:

Four coin problems have been discovered with the introduction of the DMS-100
in Pacific Bell.  These are:
 1. Applied +48 Volts for Coin Presence Test
 2. Coin Return Voltage
 3. Paramater - Per call ground loop detection test
 4. Overheating of GX18AB cards Real clever name there..(Did ya get the pun?)

+48 Volts associated with coin service is used for Coin Overtime, Coin Presence
Tests and Automatic Coin Toll Service (ACTS).  +48V is used in ACTS to reset
the totalizer so that coin counting can be acomplished.  NT has developed a
workaround for interfacing to ACTS.  Therefore the main problem is the coin
presence test.  In normal situations, battery is applied to Tip side with the
ring side opened.  +48V is applied to the ring sing of the line which detects
the presence of a coin or no coin.  If no ground condition exists, no coin is
present.  If a coin is stuck (ground condition) a line 112 report will print in
the CO.

Without +48V this cannout be done.

In a situation where a customer deposits .20 cents on a call requiring a .50
cent deposit, the .20 cent deposit is not being returned.  The TSPS machine,
handling all call processing, will instruct the End Office to sent out voltage
(Normal +110 Volts for collect and -110 for return) that will return the inital
deposit.  ACTS then resets the totalizer which enables coin counting to begin
on the initiation of the required .50 cent deposit.  Presently, the DMS is not
doing this.


well whatever.

Anyway, the fact that something is really wrong or different or strange about
Broadway is not a unique idea.  I've held it since I met him and especially
since he started to talk about his balls.  Who cares, so any new developments
with people coming to SummerCon?

Well its hard to second guess Broadway's sincerity about appearing at

Still, he did show up (rather rudely) at TelePub '86, but then this took place
in New York anyway.

    Well my patience has worn thin with Broadway. He is practically begging me
to call him, so I left him a nasty reply that generally told him to stop
"bugging" me (no pun intended). About him going to Summercon, I say...tell him
no. After all, you guys have the final say so dont you. If you have any doubts,
just read the last posts. Hell, its obvious that he's happy as a fucking lark.
And if you still have any qualms, think about it like this :

Would you invite a fagg to YOUR party?

    As I said, there are alot more non-elitist going to the party then you all
think. I could count out at least 20 off hand that non of you have probably
ever heard of. All I can say is, good luck. If I were you I would print up a
big article in Phrack and say its cancelled, then only invite selected people.

and in T1 ORBs. Then we shall examine the line and trunk link network, with
maps,  lectures, and sketches on behalf of all of us. Then it will be a
question and anwser session, with Remreeds, Reed Relays, Serving Area
Interfaces, F1 layout, interoffice trunk maintenance, toll office reports, and
ferrite sticks abounding. Then we will discuss WC's and MDF's and the duties
of the MCC in all ESS levels.

Actually, it sounds inttersting to me (just about everything above) but there's
a time and place for technical discussion, and also a time for fun. So nyah.

being low on files for Phrack) we would make a file or two a special feature
like Phrack Work News or Phrack Pro-file, but with anyone contributing or
writing it. I was think of datacapturing that stuff on sub 4 or maybe some of

    Okay, since no one ever agrees with me, I thought I would explain my self
this time around and hopefully make you understand that if alot of people show
the show wont go. Im sure alot of you realize what kegs cost and Im sure with
all the folks showing up (most of them probably not pitching in much - do they
ever?), we are not going to be drinking as much as we like. 100 people in two
rooms (not counting Broadway) - how wonderful. What do the people do who cant
fit - (idea!) sit in the lobby and wait of course. Where do the people who can
no longer stand go when its time for all 100 (in two rooms) people to crash? I
couldnt tell you. What happens when the cops come? We run. What happens when
Mrs Blow's son ends up in jail - she sues (or at least causes alot of bs), what
happens when the cops, finding drunken people in the hallway, stumble across a
drunken Taran King. They bust him and get him for many things including
Intoxification (minor), Serving Minors (is that a law?), Causing a Publid
Disturbance...among other things. What happens when Jay hits the "tank"...he
gets 4 years in an Indiana Correctional Institure (Ive always wanted to pick
potatoes). I was just thinking of everyone else, mostly TK.

I have been to some pretty big partys, the majority of which were busted. Big
partys are big news, and tend to draw attention from the less desirables
(mainly cops). Contrary to what many on here have stated, the only place I
would invite a faggot is the next Challenger to the stars. Now, Ive said my
peice, and of course, as always, someone will disagree, someone will rag or
someone will generally be pissed off, hate me for life, "de-"friend me or
whatever. I know, Ive been a real negative, burnt-out, stupid-ass...BUT I DONT

I think people are overestimating what will occur at SummerCon.  I hardly
expect 100 people to show up.  Shit, even if that many do, a lot of people
seem to be getting their own rooms...but for them to toss in like $5-$10, it
shouldn't be a big deal.  If the kegs don't work out, we'll just get cases of
something (not as good, but still does the trick).  As for being busted because
too many people show up, only phreak/hacks will be allowed into the room as
this is not an opened "party", per say.  We will not be too rowdy because we
are in these rooms for 2 nights and we cannot afford to be kicked out,
therefore, people WILL be quiet (Friday night anyway) and people WILL NOT be
wandering around the hotel drunk unless they're in another room which won't
affect ours.  The rooms will NOT be trashed because we're not positive h ow
getting them will go (it will be under a fake name, but if they need ID, we're
going to have to use someone's real one probably).  I don't know, we'll work it
out, but don't expect all of those obnoxious things that usually happen at
hotel parties to happen because if we get kicked out, people can't just drive
or stumble back home afterwards...

Name: Cheap Shades 3
Date: 7:18 pm  Tue May 19, 1987

As far as Big hotel parties go it's usually not a question of cops showing up.
It's more a question of Hotel Management.  As far as that goes, hotel
management is usually pretty cool about not kicking partiers out because they
still make money off those people (as long as shit ain't getting torn up) and
it's bad publicity to kick a bunch of drunk people out of a hotel because they
end up driving drunk.  Also public intoxacation of a minor is a crime but being
in a hotel gets you out of being publically intoxicated.  About the kegs,
because there's a $25 deposit on kegs and $50 deposit on tappers I seriously
doubt that we'd be getting kegs unless we can come up with a large quantity of
money ahead of time. (Very unlikely).

  If you ask me (you don't), mentioning the word 'party' or 'beer' or anything
like that in the same sentence/post as 'SummerCon' is only yelling to the
world that something is going to be goinng on. Now, it would be better if ther
would have been nothing mentioned of partying, until we got there. Anyway, I
don't think it should be such a party where everyone has to pass out, I'm not
for that. Getting nice and fucked up to where you can walk (with difficulty)

for large naked fat men and hopefully trying to have a good time without

there were bottle and cans everywhere, and the manager only came up once (we

A funny story about Phil-Con the last Big (not nearly as big as Summer-C on
will be) phreak conference.

Tuc and I only knew what hotel it was, no room number and the name it was
supposed to be under was not checked in. We saw a photocopied paper saying:
"You hold the Keys to Security" with the Pennsylvania Bell logo. Scrawled on
the bottom was Phreak-Con IV. No room number there, but it did prove that they
were there, somewhere...

Well we came to the conclusion that the only way to find them was check every
room assuming either a door would be open and we would recognize Videosmith
and the others, or they would be making enough noise for us to hear. After
about the 3rd floor of listening, I was not paying attention and had my ear
about 6 inches from a door, listening for phreaks (a smart move, hey we had no
other way of finding them ok? ok?) and there was a hotel security guy. Well
while I was busy looking like a theif, Tuc saw him, with the eagle eye he has,
as the guy was 2 or 3 yards away. Well of course he wondered what I/we were
doing. We told him the truth (not a misatake for once) and he checked our ID.

Then we asked if there were any complaints. Well he remarked about about some
guys stealing all these hotel phones... A giveaway. We told him thanks and got
the room . That was them allright. We spent the remainder of the night being
chased by security and hiding phones. (Not really us (me, Tuc, and Videosmith)
but the locals) of course it was unavoidable or just plain stupid to just sit
and wait to be ejected from the hotel so we departed also.

Anyhow, they were never thrown out just warned many times. And thats it. Just
thought I would relay that story for those few people interested.

   Because of alarms they now have the machine, use the following catiously.

1) The quarter with the hole drilled in the middle will work on most machines.
   Its just hard to get the quarter back above the credit pin.

2) There is ALWAYS an extra set of keys to the front or back of the machine,
   hanging on the inside of the door.

3) The back wood they use (for the back) is like cardboard. It makes a big
   noise when cracked, but cracked it is - and easily.

4) ROM chips can be sold.

5) The penny up the coin slot still works on older games, like Pac Man. On
   MIDWAY games justflip the penny in the quarter inch slot up in the coin
   return. Flip it til it goes up, and hopefully you'll get a credit. On Atari
   games and similiar (ones with vertical coin slots), hold your finger up
   inside the coin return slot so the penny wont fall all the way down. Drop a
   penny in and once it sits there, carefully move it into the next slot on the
   right (right next to it). Flip it up. Nickels are easier.

   If Phrack just monthly?  Seems you see it one month (new version), then you
don't for another 2 months.  Or is it one of those deals that "When it comes
out, it comes out".

filters off audio, and then, scream into the phone, and at the same time drop
them 1 by one.. creates a neat little fade in effect..also, well never mind

Blah.  Vaguely interesting article in NetworkWorld about toll fraud.  About
a texas man who sold 15 codes to secret service agents for $3,000 (200 a
piece!?) from TNT.  But the big excitmnt about it is that he was found guilty
by a judge and will now go in front of a jury, making it the first time a
toll fraud case when in front of a jury.  or something like that.

Noble House crashed Stroke Of Midnight.  I knew you would care.

In other news...Bill From RNOC reports that french kissing his dog is a bad
idea.  And KL admits he is a mall rat.  More later.
