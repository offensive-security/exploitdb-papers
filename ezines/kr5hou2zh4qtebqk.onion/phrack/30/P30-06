                   Decnet Hackola : Remote Turist TTY (RTT)
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                           A Late-Night Creation Of

                                   *Hobbit*

This VMS network frob is yet another "tell"-type thing.  This one has an
uncommon feature though:  recursion (i.e. you can be connected to some host
and open *another* connection to a third host and it will [attempt to!] "do the
right thing").  Also, you can ^Y out and if you run it again, it will return to
the open connection instead of starting a new one.

_H*


*************************************************************************
$! RTT -- Remote Turist TTY interface.  Do @RTT hostname or @RTT area.node
$! to start; this file must exist in the remote machine's default area.
$! You can ^Y out and the network channel will stick around; invoking RTT
$! again will resume the extant process and ignore arguments.
$! If we are a network object, play server, if not, we must be the client.
$! If we are called while already playing server, recurse to the end host.
$! This recursion in theory can happen infinite times.  Make damn sure
$! what you call this file and the "task=" spec jive, and that they are the
$! same file, or you will fall victim to very vicious timing screws.
$!
$! Another result of *Hobbit* abusing network file jobs until well past dawn.
