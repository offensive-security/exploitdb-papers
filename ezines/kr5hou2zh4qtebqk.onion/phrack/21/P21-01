     Welcome to Phrack Inc. Issue XXI.  So far, we've been relatively
productive in getting files and getting issues together for the future.  If you
would like to contribute a file for Phrack Inc., please contact The Mentor or
Epsilon and they will forward the files to us, or if you are on any of the
connecting networks, send mail and/or files to Taran King's address:
C488869@UMCVMB.BITNET.  We are pleased to introduce a trilogy pertaining to
the security of the phreak/hack community and various aspects thereof.  The
first file, "Shadows Of A Future Past" and the next two files will be in the
next two issues, so be watching for those.  It's great to be "back."

                                              Taran King & Knight Lightning
