                                A Review of H.I.P.

                          <torquie@landslide.openix.com>


Out of all of the cons I've been to (and I've been to loads), Hacking In
Progress was definitely the coolest and the most surreal hacker con ever.
This was definitely a European event though there were a few arrivals from the
US.  The atmosphere was carnival.  It was like an old style con where you got
together to meet up with people face to face, exchange ideas and basically
have loads of fun.

Around 2500 people attended: hackers, artists, media, police... a total mish -
mash of cultures and ideas.

HIP was a total geek-fest.  Computer networks were spread across the campsite.
In the mornings (when I actually slept) I awoke to the chirping of birds and
the booting up of windows95.  In the evenings I sat around the campfire
chatting to mates while the hardcore's played DOOM and exchanged warez.

During the day there were various activities.  One tent held lock-picking
classes.  In another a group of astronomers had set up telescopes linked to
computerized data-tracking equipment that you could print out.  The
cypherpunks had their own tent set up and I snuck in occasionally for a chat
and a cold drink.

There was a videoconference link connected to HOPE but it crashed and was
abandoned.  In the main marquee, there were lectures on the usual faire of
hacker interests: computer security, the legalities of hacking, anonymous
re-mailing, cryptography, etc.  The weather was boiling and my melted brain
found it exceedingly difficult to concentrate.  Most of my time I spent
outside in the shade or the tent housing the bar, talking to people
individually or in small groups.

The public telephones mysteriously malfunctioned on Sunday and could only be
used to dial the emergency services.  However if you dialed the Dutch
equivalent to 911 you got a dial tone, so you could dial anywhere in the world
for free.  Supposedly this was a 'programming error' on the part of the Dutch
Telephone Company.

Smaller more interactive workshops were also held.  Though the technical
lectures were really interesting, my favourite event was Padeluun's yo-yo
workshop.  Besides the fact that I got to keep the yo-yo, the workshop itself
was farcical performance art.  If you know the background you will understand
what I mean, if not...  Padeluun is a member of the FOEBUD group from Germany.
These people do some really brilliant projects and are very politically
motivated.   One of their projects was to put up networks during the war in
the former Yugoslavia.  They also work to distribute PGP to groups in
countries with oppressive governments.  It is not just anyone who could pull
off a workshop like this.  This was high irony.  When I walked up the workshop
had already started and I came in on the line 'yo-yoing is good for social
engineering, no one finds you a threat when you yo-yo'.  As the head of the
Dutch Computer Crimes division was in attendance I thought this rather
hilarious.

The attitude at HIP was really positive.  The European definition of hacking
has always been broader than the American definition.  Europeans accept the
idea of 'social hacking'.  Not hacking in the Unix sense but in the sense of
subverting technology, whether it be by pirate radio, hacking smartcards,
social engineering the feds... or whatever.  Unlike some cons I've been to in
the past couple of years, the atmosphere of HIP was really mature.  There
weren't any young kids trashing anything, there weren't any stairwells to
flood, no one set off any fire alarms or randomly destroyed anything through
boredom, and generally the people who attended had a lot of respect for the
event and the organisers.  Which means that no one I saw acted like a total
wanker and no one is going to run the event out of town.

On a personal note it was brilliant meeting people there and hearing of some of
the most recent projects people had on the go.  Since the last time this event
was held  (HEU, 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' held at the same spot in
1993), the hacker scene has changed.

One difference that struck me straight away was the fact that there were just
as many females as males.  And these women weren't girlfriends or hacker ho's
but women that are getting to grips with the technology and using it for
various projects.

Felipe Rodrigez who started Hack-tic along with Rop Gonggrip back in the early
days of Holland's hacking scene, has always been active on the political front
"For us, things have changed.  They used to call us criminals and think of us
as terrorists.  Now we advise the Ministry of Justice.  We're the only ones
who know the technology here."

Rodrigez also believes that hacking is still a very useful tool in countries
like Peru or Serbia where the state is unfair and citizens need to "defend
themselves."  This view has made him unpopular with the secret services who
consider the former Hack-tic more dangerous now that they have power in the
business community in Holland.

Though things may have changed since the early days of hacking, the European
scene seems to have become something more grown up.  "The hacker scene is now
pockets of culture.  There's alternative media, the old hacker culture, the
Unix hackers, irc, even astronomers who are into their own computer culture.
It's now for all of the people, which is why we call it Hacking in Progress,
we have progressed"

As a summation, HIP was fantastic.  It was brilliant to see most of the people
I have known in the European scene in one place and to meet some new people
who I will definitely keep in touch with the coming years.  I'm really looking
forward to the next one!  If you want photos and other articles check out the

To: All it may concern

	It has come to my attention, that people are forgetting what 
hacking is.  I'm not speaking about the freedom of information, or the 
pursuit of learning..  I'm talking about the fact that it is illegal and 
against the law..  I hear left and right..  " So and So has been busted.. 
lets protest..  Let's get the Hacker Defense Fund(TM) to help us! "

Hey time to wake up..  YOU ARE A CRIMINAL IF YOU ARE COMPROMISING THE SECURITY 
OF SITES/PHONE SYSTEMS/ETC..

Not a rant, just a note that it's time to face up to your responsibilities..

Tools for (paranoid ?) linux users 

by whynot AKA baldor

-> you need basic TCP/IP knowledge to understand this article <-

Recently not only then number of attacks on big / commercial servers and
machines with fast connections has increased, but even users with dial-in
computers have been attacked or spied on.  A good example is the winnuke.c
program that has been released on BugTraq and has been used excessively.
Although these attacks are not as "threatening" as the attacks that are
launched against big servers it can get really annoying if some idiot
frequently tries to hack you / takes your machine down / delays you.

Most Linux distributions have reacted to this development and made their
telnet/ftp/whatever servers log every access. In this way you can easily put 
annoying hosts into /etc/hosts.deny. But in my opinion there are (at least) 
two things missing which I want to discuss in detail...

1. Detecting traceroutes

Traceroute is a really powerful command, which is often used to detect where 
the computer that is being tracerouted is located and to which network it is
connected.  Because of some simple reasons you can *not* simply make it 
impossible for people to traceroute you, so the best you can do is detect *if* 
someone traceroutes you, find out *who* tracerouted you and confuse him a bit.

1.1 How does traceroute work ?

Basically traceroute just sends out IP/UDP probe-packets to the specified host.
To find out how the packet is routed (through which hosts it is going) 
traceroute uses the TTL (time to live) field of the IP header. This TTL field
specifies an upper limit of how many routers this packet can pass through 
before it gets dropped.  Every router decreases the value of the field when 
the packet in question arrives, until it becomes 0.  If this happens the
router sends back an ICMP TIME_EXCEED to the sender of this packet (which is 
the host that is tracerouting).

So the strategy traceroute uses to trace the path of a packet is to send
out packets to the target host putting an increasing value (starting with 1) 
into the TTL field.  If a host reports ICMP TIME_EXCEED traceroute prints out 
its address and the time that passed from the sending of the IP/UDP probe 
packet until the receiving of the ICMP TIME_EXCEED.  After that it will 
prepare a new probe packet with an IP TTL one greater then the previous packet.

Traceroute will continue doing this until it receives an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE 
packet from the target address, or the max hop count has been reached (defaults
to 30).

To understand this we should take a look at the UDP part of the packet we
talked about above.  To detect somehow that it finally reached the target host 
and should not try to go any further traceroute uses the connectionless UDP 
protocol.  The UDP part of the probe-packet is addressed to a port which is 
barley/never used (in nearly all Unix implementations 33434+ the TTL included 
in the IP-Packet).  Since (normally) nothing is listening on port 33434 (and 
above) the target host sends back an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE signal that tells 
traceroute that it reached the target host and can stop sending any more 
packets.

Since the strategy of traceroute is a bit complex here is an (a bit simplified) 
example. Let's say that you are host "source" and tracerouting your way to 
host "target".

    source:/root # traceroute target
    traceroute to target (134.2.110.94), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets

Now source sends out a probe packet to target (port 33434) with a TTL of
1.  The packet is passing "some_host" and the router decreases the TTL of
the packet.  It recognizes that the packet has "expired" (TTL=0) and sends
back an ICMP TIME_EXCEED to source.  Now traceroute uses the information
included in this packet to print out data about the first host the packets
to target are passing:
    
    1  some_host (142.45.23.1) 2.456 ms

Another probe packet is sent out by source, this time the TTL is 2 and the
port is 33434+1 = 33435.  It gets back another ICMP TIME_EXCEED packet
this time from another_host:

    2  another_host (142.45.10.1)  3.983 ms 
 
The third Probe has the TTL set to 3 and is addressed to port 33436. 
Traceroute now gets back an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE from "target": 

    3  target (142.45.10.13) 4.032 ms
 
That's it ! Traceroute now finished its job and quits.

    source:/root #
    
Please note that traceroute by default sends out three packets containing
the same TTL (each packet to an increasing port number)  to determine the
answering time of a host more accurately.  In reality, a traceroute output
therefore looks like this:

  traceroute to localhost (127.0.0.1), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
   1  localhost (127.0.0.1)  1.983 ms  1.304 ms  0.934 ms
 

1.2 The strategy behind the traceroute-detector

Knowing how traceroute works it is very easy to detect.  Simply set up
sockets listen()ing to the ports 33434 and above and react if they receive
any packets.  You can even try to guess how many hops the host that is
tracerouting you is away by subtracting 33434 from the port-number you
received the packet on and dividing the result by three.

Listening to the port traceroute sends the probe-packet to also produces a
funny effect: traceroute will neither get back an ICMP TIME_EXCEED nor
an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE signal.  Therefore it will timeout waiting for the
reply and put a * into your hosts entry.  Because of the timeout
traceroute will *not* recognize that it already reached its target and
continue sending probe-packets until the maximum number of hops is
reached.

With the little program detecttr running (and listening to ports 33434 -
33434*30*3) a traceroute localhost looks like this: 

   schnecke:/root # traceroute localhost
   traceroute to localhost (127.0.0.1), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
     1  * * *
     2  * * *
     .
     .
     .
     30 * * *
   


1.3 Problems detecting traceroutes

The only problem with detecting traceroutes is that one might select
another base-port number than the default or use another technique. 
I have never seen any people doing this though.  So if just an average 
idiot (or wannabe "hAx0r") is tracerouting you chances are really high 
that you detect it.

If you are *really* paranoid about traceroutes you should not use the
ports to detect a trace but edit the file that deals with UDP packets.
This /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/udp.c

(NOTE: this file is a part of the kernel. Recompile your kernel to make
changes take effect) 

Insert the line:

printk(KERN_INFO "UDP: packet sent to unreachable port by %s !\n", 
                                                  in_ntoa(daddr));

before line 833: 

ICMP_send(ski,ICMP_BEST_UNTEACH, ICMP_PORT_UNTEACH, 0, de);

This will make the system log *all* requests to unreachable ports that are
delivered through the UDP protocol.  Please note that the funny effect
described in 1.2 will not occur (which can also be an advantage).

BTW: Please be careful while editing the kernel - you need it :)

1.4 Sample Implementation

detecttr.c -> see the end of this file


2. Detecting pings

There has been a lot of discussion about ping in the last few months
because it was often used to transmit oversized packets to other hosts
resulting in crashes.  Although this bug has been fixed on most hosts
already ping still is very popular to slow down people who are connected
to the net through modem lines until they drop carrier themselves because
of the BIG lag.

You can *not* prevent people from pinging you (without having your ISP
blocking all ICMP_ECHO requests to your host) and therefore causing
traffic on your modem line.  But you can actually detect *who* pinged you,
determine the ping-packet size and decide not to reply (this *may* reduce
the data over your modem line up to factor 2).

2.1 How does ping work and how do people slow down others by using ping ? 

Simplified ping sends a packet containing an ICMP_ECHO and some data to the 
target which will reply with an ICMP_ECHOREPLY packet that contains the data 
sent to it (only some fields are modified).

Normally ping will wait about 1 sec before it sends the next ICMP_ECHO.  On 
many implementations of ping you can bypass this and do a "floodping" which 
will *not* wait but just send the packets as fast as possible.  If you choose 
a big packet size for the ping packet and you are pinging your victim from a 
host with a fast connection (T1 or Ethernet) this will cause a lot of traffic 
on your victims modem line and therefore slow him down to a halt. 

2.2 How can I detect a ping and how do I prevent being flooded ?

Since a ping is nothing more than a ICMP_ECHO with some data appended to it 
you can simply intercept it, extract the senders address and the packet size 
from it and decide whether you want to reply or not.  For non-floodpings you 
can reduce the amount of data transferred over your modem line simply by 
choosing not to reply.  But if someone is floodpinging you it does not help 
much to not reply to the ping packets --> the incoming ping packets will 
probably cause enough traffic to slow you down (unless the host where 
floodpings come from is has a slow connection).  At least you can give it a 
try anyway... 

2.3 Sample implementation

The handling of the ICMP_ECHO is done in the kernel. Edit your 
/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/icmp.c file and search for the section "Handle
ICMP_ECHO".  These 16 lines of code are all you need to modify to defend 
yourself against / detect ping-floods. 

If you know a little C you can easily see that there exists a define
"CONFIG_IP_IGNORE_ECHO_REQUESTS" which you can set to have the kernel just
ignore all incoming ICMP ECHO_REQUESTs. But we want to be more selective.  We 
want to log all pings that are sent to our machine. We do this by inserting 
the line

printk(KERN_INFO "ICMP: pinged by %s, packetsize = %d \n",in_ntoa(saddr),
                                                    icmp_param.data_len);

before the #endif.

You can easily change the "Handle ICMP_ECHO" section so that your machine
only replies to ICMP ECHO_REQUESTs that do not carry too much data and
ignore the pings with big packet sizes: 

<++> DTR/icmp.patch
static void icmp_echo(struct icmphdr *icmph, struct sk_buff *skb, struct device *dev, __u32 saddr, __u32 daddr, int len)
{
#ifndef CONFIG_IP_IGNORE_ECHO_REQUESTS
	struct icmp_bxm icmp_param;
	if (len <= 1000) { /* we only reply to pings that do carry less than 1k data */
		  icmp_param.icmph=*icmph;
		  icmp_param.icmph.type=ICMP_ECHOREPLY;
		  icmp_param.data_ptr=(icmph+1);
		  icmp_param.data_len=len;
		  if (ip_options_echo(&icmp_param.replyopts, NULL, daddr, saddr, skb)==0)
		      icmp_build_xmit(&icmp_param, daddr, saddr, skb->ip_hdr->tos);
		  printk(KERN_INFO "ICMP: pinged by %s, packetsize = %d \n", in_ntoa(saddr),icmp_param.data_len);
	  }
	else 
		printk(KERN_INFO "ICMP: possible FLOOD DETECTED by %s, packetsize = %d \n", in_ntoa(saddr),len );
#endif
	kfree_skb(skb, FREE_READ);
}

  This project is a result of a need to have a more versatile phone for at 
home and in the field.  Many "phone modification" files have been floating 
around the scene for quite some time - some are incomplete, inaccurate, or 
would be better taken advantage of if they were all integrated.  This project 
should be a good starting point for making your phone elite.

  The following modifications are divided into two primary parts:  The first
being made to your phone directly, and the second being as a separate
component.

  Since I'm cool, I'll give you a rough walk-through on the construction along
with the schematic.  The phone modifications were kept to a minimum, since you
most likely want the majority of your cute toys in the modular component.  I
would like to make these devices modular as well at some point in the future 
- if anybody would like to beat me to it, by all means.


--[ring switch]----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Desolder wire off one pad of the piezo element (ringer)
2. Connect desoldered *pad* to right pole of SPDT
3. Connect desoldered *wire* to center pole of SPDT
4. Connect LED to left pole of SPDT
5. Connect other side of LED to the pad of piezo element with the origional
   wire

(Note: You should now be able to select between an audible ring and the
       flashing light.  If the LED does not light but the ringer works, switch
       the wires going to the LED as the anode/cathode are not in the right
       positions.)


--[in jack]--------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Desolder wire (-v, probably black) off one pad of the microphone
7. Connect desoldered *wire* to center pole of SPDT
8. Connect recently desoldered *pad* to right pole of SPDT
9. Connect tip (or base) of U1 to left pole of SPDT
10. Connect base (or tip) of U1 to the center pole of R2
11. Connect side pole of R2 to the pad of the mic with the original wire

(Note: You should now have the ability to switch between the audio jack and 
       the mic.  This is necessary as the audio jack always drowns-out the mic,
       even when it is doing something such as playing "UN-noise" while a tape
       rewinds.  This also serves as a mute switch.)

--[out jack]-------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Connect U2 in parallel with the speaker.

(Note: Out jack.)


--[optional digital recorder]-------------------------------------------------

13. Desolder mic from Hallmark card (IC1), it will not be used
14. Connect desoldered mic wires to the base and tip of U2 in parallel
    (isolated)
15. Desolder speaker from IC1, it will not be used
16. Desolder one speaker wire, it will not be used
17. Connect the other speaker wire to R1
18. Connect other side of R1 to the mic pad that has the original (v+) wire
    and R2 connect to it
19. Desolder "play switch" paying attention to how it is connected, it sucks
20. Connect SW2 in it's place
21. Connect v- (black wire) of 6v power source to SW2
22. Connect v+ to IC1

(Note: You should now be able to record from the mic and jack, and be able to
       play it back into the phone.)

2 Bridge Rectifier     276-1161a 1/$0.99  D1, D3

(Note: I substituted the 1N914/4148 Silicon Diode for the Zener and it seems to
       work fine, 276-1122, 10/$1.19)


  As you may of noticed, the Parasitic Tap Detectors are taken straight from
the article Tap Alert in 2600 vol 13 iss 1, credit is given to No Comment and
Crash Test Idiot.

  Now, what all this is.  You have two primary inputs, and one master input in
case you have a single connector with two lines on it.  There are two
"outputs", whose function is up to you (these are optional).  Now you are left
with one master output, whose function should be obvious.

  SW1 & SW7 change between the "outer" and "inner" wires, in other words
Red/Green vs. Black/Yellow.  SW2 & SW8 reverse polarity of the line (one is
optional).  SW3 & SW9 serve as polarity detectors, lighting one color for a
certain polarity and another color for the other polarity (one is optional).
SW4 & SW10 make use of the tap detectors.  Most of the time you will not be
using the tap detectors as they can have problems with the other devices on the
line, experiment.  SW5 & SW11 are primary line power switches, make the line go
off or on.  SW6 & SW12 are hold switches for each line, when they are both "off
hold" you may conference the two lines.

  The polarity changers are a must - often times store-bought telephone cables
reverse voltage, and even your wall jack might have non-uniform polarities.  To
use both lines at once, the polarity for each line must be the same, this can
be achieved by throwing just one switch if they are reversed (it's an either/or
state).

  If you find any errors or corrections you would like to make, or you just
need a shoulder to cry on, my email is listed above.  Any upd8s can be found at
