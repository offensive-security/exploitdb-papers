                               November 17, 1989


     Greetings and welcome to Issue 29 of Phrack Inc.  For those of you who
have been with us from the beginning, the date on this issue may hold some
historical significance:

                     Happy Fourth Anniversary Phrack Inc.!

     This issue we feature two files dealing with electronic fund transfer
written by a member of the Legion of Doom who wishes to remain anonymous.
The second article tells a story detailing how an actual electronic fund
transfer might take place -- Is it true or is it fiction?  We decided to let
you, the reader, decide that for yourself.

     The Future Transcendent Saga continues as usual in this issue with part
two of "Introduction to the Internet Protocols."  We also present to you the
second edition of Network Miscellany which focuses largely on Public Access
Unix systems around the country.  Last, but not least, concerning the wide area
networks, we have Covert Paths -- a file about hacking on the Internet and how
to make sure you cannot be tracked down.

     On a lighter note, it appears that Teleconnect Magazine liked The Mentor's
"Hacker's Manifesto" so much that they decided to print a portion of it in
their November 1989 issue.  If you receive this magazine you will find it on
page 55, but only the last 4 paragraphs (they apparently did not like the
beginning of the file).  The interesting thing is that Teleconnect claims that
they were given the article by MCI Security who recently discovered it on a
bulletin board.  If you are a long time reader of Phrack Inc., you might
remember that this article was dated for January 8, 1986 and originally
appeared in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue VII (file 3 of 10) and again in issue
XXIV (file 3 of 9).

     As always, we ask that anyone with network access drop us a line to either
our Bitnet or Internet addresses...
