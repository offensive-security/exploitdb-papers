BROADCASTING NETWORKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although these articles discuss things about communicating through computer
networks, there are ways to contact broadcasting networks via the nets.  The
Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has their own UUCP node:

Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)
UUCP Node name:  pbs
Node contact:  pbs!postmaster (Senton R. Droppers)
Telephone number:  (703) 739-5089

There are also a number of radio stations that can be contacted via Fidonet:

KFCF
Fresno, CA
Contact:  Randy.Stover@f42.n205.z1.fidonet.org

KKSF
San Fransisco, CA
Contact:  Tim.Pozar@fidogate.fidonet.org

KKDA
Dallas, TX
Contact:  Gerry.Dalton@f1213.n124.z1.fidonet.org


ECNCDC (BITNET)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Western Illinois University, Eastern Illinois University as well as the
University of Northeastern Illinois, Chicago State University and Governors
State University are part of the Educational Computing Network.  The
Educational Computing Network is a service of the Board of Governors of State
Colleges and Universities operating as a cooperative to supply mainframe
academic computing resources to each of its members (ECN is strictly for
academic use and does no administrative computing).  The cooperative effort of
the members of the Educational Computing Network allows for more academic
computing resources to be made available to the members than they could supply
on their own.

Each member institution of the Educational Computing Network has a unique
letter for the first letter in all their user names.  The letters are:

     Chicago State University            - B
     Eastern Illinois University         - C
     Governors State University          - G
     Western Illinois University         - M
     University of Northeastern Illinois - U

Each member of ECN also has a person which is the interface between ECN and the
university called their User Coordinator.  The User Coordinator's username
consists of their school letter followed by UCM000 (the User Coordinator for
WIU is MUCM000).

For more information about the Educational Computing Network, contact
XJJGUDE@ECNCDC.BITNET


MCI MAIL
~~~~~~~~
If you read the first Network Miscellany article which appeared in Phrack 28,
you may remember my mentioning CMR, the Commercial Mail Relay.  Unfortunately,
due to its restrictions about who can use it (supposedly), it has potential to
become a sticky situation if the user you are sending to no longer has his MCI
Mail account or if you accidentally mistype the MCI Mail address.  But to save
us from this potential problem, MCI Mail now has their own domain on the
Internet, MCIMAIL.COM so mailing to userid@MCIMAIL.COM should work just as well
as CMR without the risks of being yelled at (and possibly billed).


PUBLIC ACCESS UNIXES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Part of the problem with the whole idea of using the Wide Area Networks is
access.  For those who are not enrolled in a university or cannot pull strings
at their local business or college, the concept of communicating through the
networks is useless besides thinking that it would be neat.  Thanks to Phil
Eschallier, phil@lgnp1.UUCP or phil@LS.COM, you should now be able to get
access to the Wide Area Networks via UUCP.  The following is a list of Public
Access Unix systems taken from the Usenet Newsgroup pub.nixpub which Phil keeps
up and there are two versions, both of which contain the same basic information
but each has important information which the other does not necessarily have.
I urge you to attempt to get on one of these systems and drop us a line over
the networks.
