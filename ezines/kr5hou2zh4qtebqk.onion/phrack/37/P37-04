 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Information Era has only recently come of age; powerful database
technology has become more affordable to implement (witness MCI's ability to
maintain a database of the people you most frequently call for participation in
its Friends & Family program), and parallel to it, information gathering has
become more extensive and more scrutinizing.  After weapons manufacturing, and
drug running, "information gathering" is probably one of the most profitable
enterprises in America.

     Over the past two decades, credit bureaus, telephone companies and direct
marketers have collectively amassed complete consumer profiles on over 150
million Americans.  But for the most part, this information has been used only
to predict consumers' future buying habits, or worse:  to influence them.  For
billing and marketing purposes, up-to-date address and telephone information,
as well as information about your household has been incidentally maintained.

     But, until recently, none of this information was COMMERCIALLY available
IN A SINGLE DATABASE, specifically with law enforcement, private-investigators,
bounty-hunters and lawyers in mind.  To our knowledge, Information America is
the first accessible service to make use of previously collected data for the
expressed purpose of providing the up-to-date whereabouts, personal profiles
and information regarding legal entanglements (i.e., bankruptcy filings,
lawsuits, etc.) of as many Americans as possible.


 Information America
 ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
     "Whether you are conducting a background check, looking for a witness,
     skip tracing, or gathering information for court, [Info America] gives
     you a quick, easy method for gathering information on individuals across
     the country... at the touch of a key."

     Information America (IA) provides a single service whose databases cross-
index the Postal Service's National Change of Address file (NCOA), major
publisher and direct marketing companies' client information, birth records,
driver's license records, phone books, voter registrations, various
governmental records, and more.  IA boasts that over 111 million names, 80
million households and 61 million telephone numbers are maintained (as
reasonably up-to-date as possible) on-line.

     Together with IA's access to additional databases, such as Dun &
Bradstreet, Secretary of State records and records from up to 49 government
agencies, you can:

     * Locate a missing defendant or witness and obtain a neighbor listing for
       further investigation.

     * Locate corporate officers, share-holders, or missing heirs.

     * Locate individuals for collection purposes.

     * Locate a fugitive parent who's kidnapped his child from the other parent
       during a custody battle.

     * Identify the corporate affiliations of an individual.

     * Examine bankruptcy, lawsuit, liens and judgement records on individuals
       and businesses.

     * Examine Securities and Exchange Commission filings and business news
       compiled from major newswires.

     * Gather information about a company's officers, ownership, financial
       status and parent/subsidiary relationships.

     * Determine if a foreign corporation has a resident agent for local
       service of process (i.e., for serving a lawsuit).


 Logging onto IA
 ~~~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~
     Access to Information America is provided through your local Tymnet dialup
(7-E-1); use a terminal identifier of 'a', and type "infoam" at the "please log
in:" prompt.  IA will prompt you with the familiar VAX 'USERNAME' and
'PASSWORD' prompts.  Usernames of the form "BIDAxxxx" (where x is a digit) are
recognizable to the VAX as IA accounts and cause it to execute the script that
provides the interactive database environment once the correct password is
supplied.  Accounts which bypass the interactive environment and provide you
with the normal VAX shell-access must exist, but neither White Knight nor I
have explored that avenue.

     In any event, once you log on, you are greeted with something similar to:

Enter your name (last name first): public, john

   ----------------------------[ Title Screen ]----------------------------

     In most cases, IA's clients use IBMs or compatibles to connect.  However,
option 1 (PERSONAL COMPUTER (or 100% IBM compatible)) works well enough for
anyone who can emulate VT-100.

     The "Enter your name (last name first)" prompt is purely for your own
internal billing purposes so that you, as a legitimate account holder, can
track account use by separate members of your corporation.  Hypothetically
speaking, if someone were interested in accessing the system without a valid
account of their own, the most likely way to alleviate suspicion would be to
use the name of someone who actually works at the account holder's organization
-- the account holder himself, for instance.

     At some point, IA will prompt you to enter a Client Billing Code.  Again,
this information is purely for the account holder's own internal billing
purposes.  IA is an expensive service; on top of the $95 per month fee, there
are hourly connect charges, per-item charges and several hidden costs.  If only
for that reason alone, IA's clients tend to be very anal about cross-checking
their itemized bills.  If possible, provide a Client Billing Code which is
consistent with the account holder's organization's billing code scheme.


 Information America: Main Menu
 ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~  ~~~~ ~~~~
     There are 19 main search-options available through IA, which fall into
three categories:

     - Corporate, UCC, & Related Records
     - Nationwide Services

     Of the three categories, options under NATIONWIDE SERVICES are the most
interesting.  Information America is easy to use, completely menu-driven and
features extensive on-line Help.  That having been said, White Knight and I
will cover only a few of IA's features and leave exploration of the more
obscure ones to the reader.


 PEOPLE FINDER
 ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
     The power of People Finder lies not only in its ability to tap various
large store-houses of data, but in its flexibility of search criteria.  (NOTE:
People Finder is available Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to midnight, Eastern
Standard time.  Holidays are excluded.)

     People Finder is made up of four services: SKIP TRACER, TELEPHONE TRACKER,
PERSON LOCATOR, and PEOPLE FINDER MULTITRACK.

     Depending on the information available, a People Finder profile may
include current address, telephone number, residence type, length of residence,
gender, date of birth, up to four household members and their dates of birth
and a neighbor listing.

SKIP TRACER traces a person's moves or verifies the current address when all
you have is an old address.  You will enter the person's name, street number,
street name, and either the Zip Code or city/state.  If your subject is in IA's
files, a profile will display that includes the address he moved to (or current
address), phone number, length of residence, and more.  You may also request a
list of 10 of the person's neighbors.  A profile on the current resident at
your subject's old address and up to 10 neighbors there may also be available.
This gives you several contacts to help you find your subject.

TELEPHONE TRACKER tracks down the owner of a telephone number. You must enter
the phone number and either the area code or the city/state.  If a match is
found, you may look at a profile of that individual/residence and a listing of
up to 10 neighbors.

PERSON LOCATOR helps you locate a person when specific address information is
unavailable.  Enter the person's name and indicate whether you wish to conduct
a search by city, state(s), zip or nationwide* PERSON LOCATOR will compile a
list of names (up to 300 names for nationwide and up to 100 names for
individual state searches) that match the information entered.  When you find
the right name, you may request a profile and neighbor listing for that
individual.

PEOPLE FINDER MULTITRACK helps you locate multiple people during one search.
Search results are available the following business day.  For each of your
subjects, enter the name and indicate the geographic area you wish to search --
nationwide*, multi state, state, city or zip.  You may enter up to 25 names per
search.  Sign off the system and let Information America do the work for you.
The following business day, log on to Information America and access the People
Finder Menu by entering PF at the Information America Beginning Menu.  From the
People Finder Menu, you may view the results of People Finder MultiTrack by
entering RR (Review People Finder MultiTrack).

REVIEW PEOPLE FINDER MULTITRACK allows you to review the status of each of the
searches you requested.  You may choose to view the results of each completed
search at this time.  Search results will be stored for seven days from the day
you requested the search.  You may review the search results at any time during
the seven-day time period through the Review People Finder MultiTrack option.
Search results include a summary listing of names that match the information
entered (up to 300 names for nationwide and up to 100 names for individual
state searches).  From the summary, you may select individual profiles and
neighbor listings.

* Nationwide search is not available for specific common surnames.  For a list
  of these surnames, enter #92 View Common Names (VC), from the People Finder
  Menu.

 Notes on People Finder
 ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
     IA is only as accurate as public records reflect.  People who move
frequently or move from apartment to apartment (students, for instance) are
either not likely to be found in IA, or the information IA provides is likely
to be out-dated.  In one search we performed, IA concluded that our subject had
lived at his residence for 3 years when, in fact, the subject had been living
there for over 15 years.

     Unlisted telephone numbers are frequently available through IA if, for
example, your subject's unlisted number has appeared in a City Directory.
Curiously, information seems to be disappearing from IA, in some cases.  A year
ago, White Knight and I looked up a celebrity's address and telephone number,
both of which IA correctly found.  When we performed the same search recently,
IA failed to find the celebrity in its records.  Searches on other individuals
which once listed their unlisted telephone numbers now yield "000-0000".  We
have no explanation for why this seems to have happened.

           companies nationwide where an individual is listed as an executive.
           Two types of reports may be available: the Executive Profile and the
           Executive Brief.

           The Executive Profile is derived from information gathered by
           American Business Information, Inc (ABI).  ABI compiles business
           listings from the yellow pages of 5,000 telephone directories.
           Telephone calls to every business are then conducted to collect

           The Executive Brief is derived from Corporate and Limited
           Partnership Records filed in the following states: AZ,CA,CO,CT,FL,
           GA,IL,IN,IA,MD,MA,MI,MO,NE,NV,NC,OK,OR,PA,SC,TX,UT,WA,WI.

     Executive Affiliation is invaluable when you need to know the business
affiliations of an adverse party.  When you enter an executive's name, reports
on over 30 million executives nationwide are searched.  You will receive a
Summary Screen with a concise listing of where your selected individual is
listed as an executive.  The detail report for each affiliation will be either
an Executive Brief or an Executive Profile.

     The Executive Profile is derived from yellow page listings of 5,000
telephone directories nationwide.  The listings are individually verified to
collect the name of the top executive at that location and their title.  The
information report may include this information in addition to the business
address, telephone number, SIC code, and type of business.  The titles for
which an Executive Profile may be available include: President, Vice President,
Chairman of the Board, Owner, Executive Director, Manager, Administrator,
Principal, Publisher, Pastor, and Rabbi.

     The Executive Brief is derived from Corporate and Limited Partnership
Records filed in the following states:  AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, IL, IN, IA, MD,
MA, MI, MO, NE, NC, NV, OK, OR, PA, SC, TX, UT, WA, & WI.

address, business name and address, as well as other executives' names,
titles, and addresses associated with that business. Executive Briefs may be
available for Officers, Partners, Agents, and Incorporators.

 Notes on Information America
 ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
     We mentioned that usernames beginning with "BIDA" are recognizable to the
IA system as IA accounts (as opposed to shell accounts).  More than likely,
other usernames are also valid as IA accounts.

     As with most systems, IA passwords are often easy to guess.  Initial
passwords, which are assigned when an account is first created, are usually
composed of the account holder's first name, or first name plus a middle or
last initial.  In some cases, the password is made up of the digits in the
username plus the first name of the account holder.  In other cases, the
password is two random letters plus a two-digit number (ex: PG13).  If users
are ever encouraged to change their password from its initial value, they
rarely seem to do so.

     You've probably noticed that IA has specific operating times (Eastern
Standard Time).  Most of IA's functions are inoperable during weekends and
holidays and outside those specific operating hours.  Occasionally on weekends,
IA itself is down.  Or more interestingly -- particularly on weekends -- the IA
interactive environment will malfunction, dropping you into the VAX shell.

     IA's clients are mostly lawyers and paralegals working at legal firms, but
the FBI is also a major IA client.  Television programs in the 60s and 70s
which depicted an FBI "Big Brother" computer system scared the public enough so
that it and the Congress have continually resisted efforts by the FBI to
implement such a system.  In the mid 80s, for example, Congress voted against
the implementation of an FBI computer system which would allow them to monitor
telephone calls.  Information America is the perfect solution for the FBI's
bureaucratic quandary.

     IA has existed for at least two and a half years, but has remained
relatively unknown to the Telecom community until last year when MoD began
using IA's People Finder to locate and terrorize people.  IA's low profile
isn't surprising; public backlash against Lotus' "MarketPlace" CD ROM --
which contained marketing information on only a few million people at most --
forced Lotus to abandon its project altogether after having invested tens of
thousands of dollars in advertising alone, just as it was about to release
MarketPlace.  What Lotus was doing wasn't unusual; large direct marketing
firms, like National Demographics & Lifestyles (NDL) have been somewhat
covertly marketing consumer names and information on CD ROM for years (with
information such as how many telephones you have; the approximate ages of your
household's members; the gender of the household head; the number and type of
cars your household has; what the mortgage value on your house is; estimated
incomes for the heads of the household, etc...).  The difference was that
Lotus was offering their CD ROM commercially so that anybody could, as the
public claimed, have the power of "Big Brother" at their fingertips.  If the
public knew about Information America, knew that anyone could tap its eye-spy
capabilities, the outrage would be tremendous.

     To market its database services, IA seems to have adopted a grass-roots
kind of approach.  IA employs liaisons in major metropolitan cities whose
job it is to research and contact prospective clients -- lawyers, for example.
We are unaware of any advertising in specialized journals.

     We take for granted the existence of government-run databases which
contain even more detailed information on Americans than IA possesses.  Even
so, those databases are considerably smaller, and what's more, they're
well-regulated: the agencies that run them accountable by Law.  The potential
for abuse by a system like Information America -- devoid of any checks and
balances -- is spectacular.  MoD has already demonstrated this to a small
extent.  The same technology advances which were supposed to make at-home
shopping a convenience and tailor marketing to your needs have now made
surveilling you cost-effective, accurate and as easy as touching a key.

     One of the least reported items to come to light out of the Iran/Contra
proceedings was that, as head of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration (FEMA) -- the organization which coordinates relief efforts
across the United States during natural disasters -- Oliver North had drawn up
FEMA contingency plans of a different sort: in the event of war in Central
America, the Constitution was to be suspended and FEMA was to round up aliens
(particularly Hispanics) and US Citizens considered "subversive," and
interrogate them in Manzanar-like camps.  Databases like Information America
would no doubt have been employed in locating the whereabouts of these people.

     The importance of Information America isn't what it can do for you;
rather, what can be done with it to you.
