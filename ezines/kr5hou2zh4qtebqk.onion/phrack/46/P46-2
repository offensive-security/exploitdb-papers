                                Phrack Loopback


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to write you about my friends cat.  His name is 'Cid.  Cid
loves reading, in fact he'll read just about anything, from the labels on
his cat food tins to the instructions on the "real" use of his Grafix
(incense burner :) ).  Well one take, 'Cid (or was it me) was indulging
in the reason he got his moniker and mentioned that he'd like to receive
Phrack.  Well i told him he could just subscribe to it and then he went
into a real sob story about how he doesn't have net access.  So as a
favor to 'Cid (who really does exist, and really has tripped out on brain
blotters) i'd like to subscribe to Phrack.

[You my want to take note that Phrack can also be printed on paper.
 Now, that's a lot of blotter.

 You've got your subscription, now go watch some anime.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently got a new job and shortly after beginning working there, they
decided to retool and reorganize a bit for better productivity.

While we were going through some old boxes and stuff, I came across a
little black box with the words "Demon Dialer" molded into the front of
it, it even had the (functional!) 20volt power supply.

Needless to say I was pretty happy with my find.  I asked if I could have
it and since no one else there seemed to know what to make of it, mine it
was!

My only problem now... I've played around with it, and it seems to do a
lot more than what I originally thought, but the fact of the matter is..
I really haven't the foggiest idea of how to get it to REALLY work for me.

If anyone has any information, or better still, actual documentation for
a Telephonics Inc, Demon Dialer.. I'd really appreciate passing it on to me.

Also, something rater strange.  The phone cable attached to it had a
normal looking 4-wire connector on one end, but the other was split to
have RJ jacks, one with the yellow-black combo and one with the
red-green.  The split ends (sorry :)) were plugged into the WALL and
PHONE jacks on the demon dialer.  The purpose for this perplexes me since
one's supposed to be input and one's supposed to be a passthrough for the
phone to be plugged into.

Anyway, any info would be nice.  Thanks guys.

[Telephonics was one of those odd telco device manufacturers back in the
 80's.  They made the demon dialer (a speed dialing device), a
 two-line conference box, a divertor, etc.  Essentially, they provided
 in hardware what the telco's were beginning to roll-out in software.

 I think the line splitter you have was merely plugged into those
 two jacks for storage purposes.  What that probably was for was to
 allow two lines to use the Demon Dialer.  It was probably just reversed
 when your company boxed it so it wouldn't get lost.

 I'm not sure if Telephonics is still in business.  A good place to
 start looking for info would be comp.dcom.telecom or alt.dcom.telecom.
 Another good place may be Hello Direct (800-HI-HELLO).  They used to
 do have Telephonics equipment available for mail-order.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I saw an ad for a book called "Secrets of a SuperHacker" by Knightmare.
Supposedly it intersperses tales of his exploits with code and examples.
I have big doubts, but have you heard anything good/bad about it?

[Your doubts are well founded.  I got an advance copy of that book.
 Let's put it this way:  does any book that contains over a dozen pages
 of "common passwords" sound like ground breaking material?

 This book is so like "Out of the Inner Circle" that I almost wanted
 to believe Knightmare (Dennis Fiery) was really yet another
 alias for Bill Landreth.  Imagine "Out of the Inner Circle" with
 about a hundred or more extra pages of adjectives and examples that
 may have been useful years back.

 The Knightmare I knew, Tom in 602, whose bust by Gail Thackeray
 gave law enforcement a big buffer of the Black Ice Private BBS
 and help spark the infamous LOD Hacker Crackdown, certainly didn't
 have anything to do with this.  In fact, the book has a kind of
 snide tone to it and is so clueless, that leads me to believe it
 may have been written by a cop or security type person looking to
 make a quick buck.

 As far as source code, well, there is a sample basic program that
 tries to emulate a university login.

 If you want a good book, go buy "Firewalls and Internet Security" by
 Cheswick and Bellovin.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey Chris,

I'm sure you are under a constant avalanche of requests for certain files,
so I might as well add to your frustration <grin>.  I know of a program
that supposedly tracks cellular phone frequencies and displays them on
a cellmap.  However, I don't know the name of the program or (obviously)
where to find this little gem.  I was wondering if you could possibly
enlighten me on a way to acquire a program similar to the one I have
described.  I have developed some other methods of tracking locations
of cellular calls.  However my methods rely on a database and manually
mapping cellular phones, this method is strictly low tech.  Of course
this would be for experimental use only, therefore it would not be used
to actually track actual, restricted, radio spectrum signals.  I wouldn't
want the aether Gestapo pummeling our heads and necks.

[I don't know of anything that plots frequencies on a cellmap.  How would
 you know the actual locations of cells for whatever city you may
 be in to plot them accurately?

 There are a number of programs written to listen to forward channel messages
 and tell you when a call is going to jump to another channel.  The cellular
 telephone experimenter's kit from Network Wizards has a lot of nice
 C source that will let you write your own programs that work with their
 interface to the OKI 900.  I suppose you could get the FCC database
 CD-ROM for your state and make note of longitude and latitude of cell sites
 and make your own database for your city, and then make a truly
 visual representation of a cellmap and watch calls move from cell to cell.
 But I don't think there is such a thing floating around the underground
 at present.

 Of course the carriers have this ability, and are more than happy to make
 it available to Law Enforcement (without a warrant mind you).  Hi OJ!

 email Mark Lottor mw@nw.com for more info about the CTEK.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I saw this in a HoHoCon ad:

        Top Ten Nark List
        1. Traxxter
        2. Scott Chasin
        3. Chris Goggans
        4. Aget Steal
        5. Dale Drrew
        6. Cliff Stoll
        7. [blank]
        8. Julio Fernandez
        9. Scanman
       10. Cori Braun

What did Chris Goggans do?  Isn't he Erik Bloodaxe, the publisher of
Phrack?  I sincerely doubt that the feds would have someone
working for them that puts out a publication like Phrack.  It would
be way too much of an embarrassment for them.  I wrote to the
editor of Phrack when I read that Agent Steal said that the publisher
of Phrack was a Fed - IN PHRACK no less.  He said it was a stupid rumor.
Is there anything to support this fact?  And why is there now some manhunt for
Agent Steal (at CFP the FBI was checking legs) if Steal was admittedly
their employee?  The whole thing is very confusing to me.  Please explain.
If Goggans isn't Bloodaxe then he'd Knight Lightning (this just came to me).
Nevertheless, what's the story here?

[First off, I think you take things a little too seriously.  If you are on
 a nark hunt, worry about your associates, not people you obviously
 don't even know.  Chris Goggans (ME) is most positively Erik Bloodaxe.
 Thanks for remembering.

 Agent Steal was involved with the FBI.  This is a fact.
 In his case, he even appeared to have some kind of immunity while trying
 to gather information on other hackers like Mitnik and Poulsen.  This
 immunity is under scrutiny by the Bureau's own Internal Affairs (or so the
 new rumors go), since Steal was pulling a fast one and committing crimes
 the Bureau didn't know about to get some quick cash while he set up his
 friends.

 My story is a bit more convoluted.  You can sum it up by saying, if you
 interfere with my businesses, I'll try my best to track you down and turn
 you in.  I guess I am a nark.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I read in the last Phrack (45) that you wanted someone to write a few
words on scrambling systems. Give me a rough outline of what you want
and I'll see if I can help :-) Basically I wrote the Black Book
(European Scrambling Systems 1,2,3,4,5 and World Satellite TV &
Scrambling Methods) and also edit Hack Watch News & Syndicated
HackWatch. They all deal with scrambling system hacks as opposed to
computer hacking & phreaking. (Things are a bit iffy here as regards
phreaking as all calls are logged but the eprom phone cards are easy
to hack) Oh yeah and another claim to fame ;-) if you can call it
that, is that I was quoted in an article on satellite piracy in
"Wired" August issue.

This Hawkwind character that you had an article from in Phrack43
sounds like a *real* hacker indeed :-> Actually there is an elite in
Ireland but it is mainly concerned with satellite hacking and that
Hawkwind character is obviously just a JAFA (Irish hacker expression
- Just Another Fu**ing Amateur). Most of the advanced telco stuff is
tested in the south of the country as Dublin is not really that
important in terms of comms - most of the Atlantic path satellite
comms gear and brains are on the south coast :-)

Actually the Hawkwind article really pissed off some people here in
Ireland - there were a few questions asked on my own bbs (Special
Projects +353-51-50143) about this character. I am not even sure if
the character is a real hacker or just a wannabe - there were no
responses from any of his addresses. SP is sort of like the neutral
territory for  satellite and cable hacking information in Europe
though there are a few US callers. With the way things are going with
your new DBS DirecTv system in the US, it looks like the European
satellite hackers are going to be supplying a lot of information
(DirecTv's security overlay was developed by News Datacom - the
developers of the totally hacked VideoCrypt system here in Europe).

There telco here uses eprom phone cards. These are extremely easy to
hack (well most real hackers in .IE work on breaking satellite
scrambling systems that use smart cards) as they are only serial
eprom.

Regards

[About the satellite information:  YES!  Write the biggest, best
 article the whole fucking hacker world has ever seen about
 every aspect of satellite tv!!  Personally, I'm more interested in
 that than anything else anyone could possibly write (seeing as how
 I'm about to buy a dish for both C and Ku).

 About Hawkwind's article on hacking in Ireland:  If I were to write
 an article about hacking in America, it would be entirely different
 than anyone else in America would write.  A country is a big place.
 Just because someone else's hacking experience is different than
 your own, it's no reason to discredit them.  However, if your
 exposure to the scene in Ireland is so completely different than
 Hawkwind's, I would LOVE to print it as well.]

The Columbus Freenet uses a password generating routine that takes the
first and last initial of the user's real name, and inserts it into a randomly
chosen template.  Some of the templates are:

E(f)www5(l)
(f)22ww5(l)    where f and l are first and last initials
(f)2ww97(l)
(f)2ww95(l)

and so on.  There are not too many of these templates, I guess maybe 50.
I imagine most people go in and change their password right away, but
then again that's what a prudent person would do (so they probably don't).

Columbus 2600 meetings:

Fungal Mutoid-sysop of The KrackBaby BBS (614-326-3933) organized the
first 2600 meetings in Columbus, unfortunately hardly anyone shows up...
I don't know why HP is so dead in Central Ohio, but fear and paranoia
run rampant.
That's all for now...keep up with the good work!

R.U.Serius?!

[Hmmm...templates are always a bad thing. All one has to do is get the
 program that generates them, and viola, you've got a pre-made dict file
 for your crack program.  Not very smart on the part of the Freenet,
 but hacking a Freenet, is like kicking a puppy.

 I hope more people go to your 2600 meetings.  The ones here in Austin
 kinda died out too.  Maybe our cities are just lame.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A complaint:  That piece about McDonald's in Phrack 45 was, in a word, LAME.
Surely Phrack can do better.  Maliciousness for its own sake isn't very
interesting and frankly the article didn't have any ideas that a bored
13-year-old couldn't have thought up--probably written by one.

That aside, I found some good stuff in there.  Some of it was old news,
but Phrack serves an archival purpose too, so that was ok.  On a more
personal note, I could really relate to your account of HoHoCon--not that
I was there, just that I have started to feel old lately even though I don't
turn 25 for another 2 days  :)  Sometimes I feel myself saying things like
"Why, sonny, when I was your age the Apple II was king..."

Keep up the good work, and don't let the lamers get you down.

[Thanks for the letter.  I personally thought the McDonald's file was
 a laugh riot.  Even if it was juvenile and moronic, I wouldn't expect
 anyone to analyze it and go through with anything it contained.  It was
 just for fun.  Lighten up :)

 I am glad to see that at least someone else recognizes that Phrack
 is attempting to serve as an archive of our subculture, rather than just
 a collection of technical info that will be outdated overnight, or a
 buglist that will be rendered mostly unusable within hours of release.

 There is so much going on within the community, and it is becoming such a
 spectacle in the popular media, that in 20 years, we can all go back and
 look at Phrack and remember the people, places, and meetings that
 changed the face of the net.

 Or maybe I'm just terribly lame, and either 1) refuse to put in the
 good stuff, 2) don't have access to the good stuff, 3) exist only as a
 puppet agent of The Man, or 4) Don't know nothin' 'bout Telco!
 But you know what they say about opinions.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few comments on your editorial in Phrack 44 (on information
wants to be free).  Thanks for voicing an opinion that is shared by many
of us.  I am glad to see a public figure in the CuG with nutz enuff to
actually come out and make such a statement and mean it.
Again, thanks.

Now on the subject of hacking as a whole.  Is it just me, or are the number
of losers on the increase?  There have always been those who would try
and apply these skills to ripoff scams and system trashing but now that
seems to be the sole intent of many of the "hackers" I come into contact
with.  What ever happened to hacking to learn more about the system.  To
really hack a system (be it phone, computer), is a test of skill and
determination, and upon success you walk away with a greater understanding
of the machine and its software.  Hacking is more than just knowing how
to run crack on a filched password file, or using some exploitation
scripts picked up on IRC, it is a quest for knowledge and gaining
superiority over a system by use of great skill acquired by a deliberate
effort.  Once was a time when things like toll fraud (I do miss blue
boxes) were a means to an end, now they seem to be the end in itself.

Also, I am researching info on OSI comsec procedures and have found some
really interesting goodies, if you are interested in publishing
my piece when completed, let me know..

[(NOTE:  This came from a .mil)
 Man, I'm glad to see that people in the armed forces still have minds
 of their own.  Not many people would express such a thing openly.

 Yes, the destructive/profit-motivated trends of many of the hackers of
 today are pretty sad.  But you have to realize, as the technology
 becomes more and more like consumer electronics, rather than the
 traditional mold of computer as scientific research tool, an entirely
 different market segment will be exposed to it and use the technology
 for less than scrupulous means.

 Even the act of hacking itself.  Today, I can basically gain access
 to any model of system known to man by asking.  I realize that
 there are many who cannot accomplish such a thing, but with the
 proliferation of public access sites, almost everyone can afford
 access to the net to explore and learn.  The point comes down to this:
 if you have an account on a Sun, why do you need an account on a Sun
 at Boeing, unless you either 1) want to sell the cad files of the 777 to
 Airbus or McDonnell-Douglas 2) want to get financial information to
 make a killing on Wall Street, or 3) just want to have an ego boost
 and say "I OWN BOEING!"

 Personally, I can understand the ego boost aspect, but I've decided that
 I'd much rather get paid by a company like Boeing to hack for them
 than against them.  I don't want to sell anyone's info, so hacking
 into any company is basically useless to me, unless they are paying me
 to look for potential weaknesses.

 Granted, it's not an easy market to get into, but it's a goal to
 shoot for.

 And for those who find it impossible to quit due to fear of losing
 their edge, check out my editorial in this issue for a possible
 solution.]

I am looking for a Macintosh app that does the same thing as an app
called "Demon Dial" that has been lost in the annals of software
history due to the fact that some people (sysops) question whether it
is illegal software (it dials up a series of phone #'s looking for data
connections).  Do you know where I could find an application for the Mac
that does this simple function?

[We had a guy ask in an earlier issue for Macintosh hacking/phreaking
 apps.  Noone responded.  Hell, I know SOMEONE has to use a Mac
 out there.  Are you Mac-weenies all embarrassed to speak up?

 Hell, uuencode and email me your aps, and I'll put them up for
 ftp!  Help out your poor fellow Macintosh users.  I certainly
 would if I could, but the thought of touching a Mac gives me the
 chills.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever heard of being denied access to your own cell phone?
I am currently in the process of buying a cell phone and was informed
that I COULD NOT have the programming guide of the security code
they enter to program my phone.  In my opinion the key word is "MY."
If I get a digital security system for my house you better damn well
figure I will have the security codes for that.  The phone was a Motorola
flip phone.  I called Motorola and explained how displeased I was with
this company and they said they could not interfere with a reps. policy.
When I was selling car phone we kept the programming guide unless they
asked for it.  I demanded it and they laughed in my face.  Who said
"the customer is always right" anyway?

Thanks, any info is greatly appreciated.  By the way, you wouldn't
happen to have the CN/A number for 815 would you?  Also, any ANAC
would be very helpful.

[Well, I hate to say it, but you got typical service from your
 cellular agent.  Let's face it, these sales reps probably knew
 about as much about that programming manual as I do nuclear
 physics:  "Its confusing, but if you understand it, you can fuck
 things up."

 I am surprised that Motorola wouldn't sell you the book though.
 Motorola will sell anybody anything.  You probably called the wrong
 place.  Moto is so huge they've got multiple groups working on somewhat
 similar technologies with absolutely no communication between the groups.
 Sometimes they are in different countries, but sometimes they are in the
 same city!  I would suggest you call a local FAE (Field Applications
 Engineer)
 and get them to get the book for you.  Make up some story about
 working on some computer controlled application with the phone, and that
 you need any and all documentation on the phone.  They'll do it.  Money
 is money.

 As far as the 815 CNA, hell, just call the business office.  I haven't
 called a CNA in years, only the business office.  They are nice people.
 And no PINs.

 815 ANAC:  ok guys, someone must have one...email it!

 "The customer is always right"  wasn't in Bartlett's or Columbia's
 books of famous quotations.  I guess that phrase has been written out of out
 history.  So, from now on you aren't always right, I guess.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Phrack:


We want you!

We want you to be a part of our cutting edge documentary that is traversing
across the "NEW EDGE" of computers, culture, and chaos.

Working in conjunction with Douglas Rushkoff, the best selling author of
"CYBERIA,"  we are currently gathering together the leaders of this
technological and cultural revolution.  This is not a documentary in the
traditional sense of the word.  It is more of an exploration, a journey, a
unique vision of the world as seen through the eyes of those who live on the
bleeding edge; where technology, art, science, music, pleasure, and new
thoughts collide.  A place people like you and me like to call home.

"New Edge" will deliver a slice of creativity, insanity, and infallibility,
and feed those who are hungry for more than what Main Street USA has to
offer.  This project will detonate across the US and around the world.  It
will become the who's who of the new frontier and you belong on it's
illustrious list of futurians.  Please look over the enclosed press release
description of the project.

Phrack has long been the ultimate source for hack/phreak info, and helped to
push the limits of free speech and information.  The role that Phrack has
played in the Steve Jackson Games Case set an important precedent for
CyberLaw.  We will also be interviewing several people from the EFF.

Please call me ASAP to schedule an interview for "New Edge", or send me
E-Mail.

Sincerely,

T h e  O r g a n i z a t i o n

Belief Productions in association with Film Forum.

T h e   M i s s i o n

Journey through the labyrinth of cyberia and experience the people, places
and philosophy that construct cyberspace and the shores of the technological
frontier.  This fast paced visual voyage through the digital revolution will
feature interviews with the innovators, artists, cyberpunks, and visionaries
from all sides of the planet.  These specialists are the futurists who are
engineering our cybergenic tomorrow in laboratories today.  Along the way we
will investigate the numerous social and political issues which are cropping
up as each foot of fiber optic cable is laid.  Artificial intelligence, the
Internet, nanotechnology, interactive media, computer viruses, electronic
music, and virtual reality are just a few of the many nodes our journey will
explore.

T h e   F u n d i n g

This exploration is sponsored in part by a grant from The Annenberg
Foundation in association with the LA based non-profit cutting-edge media
group Film Forum.

T h e   P r o c e s s

The New Edge project will capture moving images with a variety of input
devices and then assemble them into one fluid documentary using Apple
Macintosh Quadras & PowerMac computers.  The post production work will be
done entirely on the computers using the Radius Video Vision Telecast Board
in conjunction with Quicktime software applications such as Adobe Premiere
4.0 and CoSA After Effects 2.01.  The final piece will be recorded to BETACAM
SP videotape for exhibition and distribution.  The capture formats for the
project will include: BETACAM SP, Super VHS, Hi-8, 16MM Film, Super-8 Film,
35MM Stills, and the Fisher
Price Pixelvision 2000.

T h e   R e s u l t s

New Edge will pride itself on an innovative visual and aural style which
before today, could only be created on high-end professional video systems
and only for short format spots.  The New Edge documentary will be two hours
in length and will have a dense, layered look previously featured only in
much shorter pieces.  New Edge will be a showcase piece not only for the
content contained within, but for the way in which the piece was produced.
 It will be a spectacular tribute to the products and technology involved in
its creation.

New Edge is aimed at both the technophiles and technophobes alike.  While the
show will feature very complex and sophisticated topics, the discussions will
be structured to appeal to both those who do and do not have the technical
framework that underlines the cyberian movement.  The show's content and
style will make it readily available to the MTV and Generation X demographic
groups as well as executives who want to stay on top of the latest
technological advances.  Individuals who read Mondo 2000 and Wired magazine
will also naturally latch on to this electronic
presentation of their favorite topics.

[Dear New Edge:

 You have got to be kidding me.  "Readers of Wired and Mondo 2000 will
 naturally latch on to this electronic presentation of their favorite
 topics?"

 Aren't we awful fucking high on ourselves?  Christ.  Mondo & Wired
 readers and writers (and stars) are themselves so fucking far removed
 from the real meat of the underground, that they wouldn't
 even be able to relate to it.  Obviously this "documentary"
 is going to be aimed at the wannabes who sit at home furiously
 masturbating to "Cyborgasm" while installing FRACTINT, being very
 careful not to soil their copy of "The Hacker Crackdown."  Oh joy.

 These guys are so fucking out of it, they sent me two letters.
 One addressed to Phrack, the other to Phrack / Emmanuel Goldstein.
 Maybe they think we're 2600.

 CYBER-COUNT:  12 occurrences.

 That's kind of low.  I'm surprised your public relations people didn't
 have you add in a few more cyber-this's or cyber-that's into the
 blurb.  Gotta keep that cyber-count high if you want to get those
 digi-bucks out of those cyberians!  CYBER!!!

In less than 3 weeks, I will be leaving for Basic Training.  Once out of
there, I will be working on Satellite Data Transmissions for the US
Army.  I am highly excited, just waiting to see what type of computers
I will be working on.  Anyways, I will be enrolled in a 32-week
accelerated technical class teaching me all about satellites, and
the computers that I will be using.  Here's the kick.  I'll be writing
a series of Tech Journals detailing the workings/operations of/weaknesses,
and the use of the systems.  I was wondering if you would be interested
in carrying these.  I've read Phrack for a long time, but it is an off
the wall subject.  I'll also be playing with the military phone system,
in hopes of finding out what the ABCD tones do.  (I heard from a file
that Military phones utilize them but I'm still a civilian, and am
clueless).

Thanks for keeping me informed
Kalisti!

[Sorry to hear about your impending Basic Training.  I'm not big on
 the military, as they would make me chop off all my hair.

 About the Satellite systems:  YES  If you do indeed find time to write
 up any files on how they work, systems involved, weaknesses, etc.
 I'D LOVE TO PRINT THAT!  Just make sure you don't blow your clearance.

 Satellites are very cool.  I'm about to buy a Ku Band disk to do some
 packet radio type stuff.  A bit low-tech compared to the Army, but hell,
 I'm on a budget.

 ABCD...they are used for prioritizing calls on AUTOVON.  FTS doesn't
 use them (I think), and they can only be used on certain lines.

 They are:

 A = priority
 B = priority override
 C = flash
 D = flash override

 For instance, if you want to make it known that this is an important
 call, you hit the "a" button before dialing.  It establishes a
 priority-class call, which may cause a light to come on or something
 as equally attention grabbing at the called party's end.  Priority
 calls cannot be interrupted, except by a Priority Override" etc,
 with Flash Override being the highest class.

 If you do these from an improper line, you will get an error message.
 The one I used to get when BS'ing AUTOVON op's long ago
 was "The President's use of this line is not authorized." Funny.

 Let me know if any of this is still valid.]

Dear Phrack,
The following is a copy of a Toneloc found file my friend got.  As happens
to my friend a lot the numbers aren't valid. But, you'll see he found at least
one System 75.  It appears that the 75 had a tracer installed on it already.
My friend did not get a call back on it, and nothing has been done as far
as we know.  But, I still wonder -- Is scanning no longer safe?

[Jeez.  That sure does suck.

 Well, live and learn kiddoes.  1994 is not the time to be hacking
 by direct dialing local numbers.  It's just not all that smart.

 Caller-ID has been tariffed in a lot of RBOCS.  A lot of modem
 manufacturers implemented caller-id features into their equipment.
 Having these features in the equipment means that it won't be long
 before people redesign all their login programs to make use of
 these features.  I would.

 I've got an ISDN line.  Every time I call out, the SPID (phone number)
 of the B channel I'm using is broadcast.  There is nothing I can do
 about that.  On a remote connection, almost all decent ISDN terminal
 adaptors have the option to block any SPID they don't know.  They won't
 even answer the phone, because they receive and interpret the phone
 number before any session is established.

 Yeah, well, that's ISDN, but it will not take a genius to do a few
 quick hacks on some linux box and we will suddenly be inundated with all
 kinds of "security packages" that use modems with Caller-ID.

 Yeah, I know, *67 (or whatever it is) to block the data, or
 route the call through another carrier so the data won't get passed
 (10288-NXX-XXXX).  The data is still in the system, just not being
 transmitted from the switch out to the party being called.

 It amazes me how many really smart people I know have been busted
 solely because they were hacking local systems and calling them
 directly.

 Scanning has always been a very tricky subject.  Since you are paying
 for a phone line, and if you have flat-rate service, you are
 thereby entitled to call as many numbers as you want.  The big issue
 a while back was dialing sequentially (which set some telcos on a rampage
 because call usage patterns looked like telemarketing machines).
 The other problem is harassment.  One call to an individual is a wrong
 number.  Two is bordering on harassment.  So, doing a complete scan
 and calling the carriers back through some other method would be
 a fairly good idea.  And always have your calls forwarded to a
 non-working number so the 5,000 assholes who call-return you
 during the scan won't interfere.

 If you are lucky enough to live in the boonies, you are probably
 still somewhat safe, but everyone else...be careful.]

Phrack-

        I was wondering if anyone has ever done an article on breaking
Novell Network through a workstation.  I've heard it can be done through
the SysAdmin computer, but is there a way to find the userlist and
passwords?  Also how would I go about cleaning up after myself so as to
not leave a trace on the logs.  I would appreciate a way other than screen
capture, but if anyone knows of a good boot record booting program to
do a capture of every key typed that would be great, and maybe it
could be uuencoded in the next Phrack!

        Thanks again for making the best, ass kickin', a step above the
rest, brain moving, earth shaking, body shivering, fist shaking, totally
bitchin', muy excelente, awesome H/P magazine in the whole world!  :)

                        Sincerely,

                               The Warden

[Thanks for the compliments...

 About your question though, I'm not quite sure what you mean.
 In a NetWare environment there really isn't any userlist and passwords
 that you can get at.  You can run the syscon utility and look at all the
 usernames, but not much more.  The passwords are stored in what's known
 as the "bindery."  These are 3 files in the sys/system directory
 called NET$OBJ.SYS, NET$VAL.SYS, and NET$PROP.SYS.  If you can
 pull a password out of those files, I will shit in my hat and eat it.

 Beyond that, yes, a key-capture program is definitely the ideal
 solution for monitoring activity on a PC workstation.  There is
 one in this issue.]

Hi,
   I've Been reading your magazine for a long time now, my eyes light up when
I see an advert for a UK BBS with related hacking/phreaking articles or files
on it, but when I try to ring them they are usually gone.
I've been searching for ages for BBS's in the UK with these kind of articles
on them but I've had no luck, Even postings on the USENET had little results.
I have had a few boards which are shady but they ask unusual questions about
abiding to rules/laws about hacking then they prompt with fake login and
registration schemes.

If you have some, could you possibly send or publish a list of shady UK BBS's
Id be extremely grateful

Cheers,

Steven

[Steven:

 Hell, I don't even know the numbers to any "shady" bulletin boards here
 in America.  The only UK hacker bbs I knew of in recent years was
 Unauthorised Access, but I'm sure that's the advert you are referring to.

 Maybe someone else in the UK knows something decent to call over there.
 Any takers? ]

[THE GRADY FILES]

Many of you may remember the NSA Security Manual we published last
issue.  That single file generated more press and hype than I'd
seen in a long time.  It was mentioned in several newspapers, it
appeared on television.  It was ridiculous.  The document is
available to anyone who can fill out a FIOA request.

Regardless, people went zany.  At first I couldn't figure out
why everyone was so worked up, and then I caught wind of Grady
Ward.  Grady had posted the document to the net (with all mention
of Phrack deleted from it) in several USENET forums alt.politics.org.nsa,
talk.politics.crypto and comp.org.eff.talk.  Several readers of
Phrack were quick to jump up and point out that Grady had obtained
it from the magazine (thanks guys!) which he grudgingly admitted.
Grady got to be in the spotlight for a while as the Phrack/NSA Handbook
thread continued to grow.

In the meantime, Grady was either calling, or giving him the
benefit of the doubt, getting called by an awful lot of press.
And even more compelling is the way he'd began pronouncing my
impending federal raid on so many newsgroups.

And of course, I don't have time to read any of that USENET crap
so I'm oblivious to all of this.  Then I got a message from Grady.

[GRADY WRITES]

You might want to get ready for the FBI
serving a warrant on you for information
about the NSA security employee manual
published in Phrack 45;
the NSA security people called me about 10 minutes
ago to talk about how it got on the net.

I being very cooperative, gave him
your address in Austin.

[I REPLY]

Get a grip.

Nothing that was contained in that file could not
be obtained through other sources.


[GRADY REPLIES]

Just because you did nothing illegal, doesn't mean that
you won't be annoyed by the FBI.  Generally they will
be very polite however.

Gripping.  Now what?

[I REPLY]

Ok,

If someone actually did contact you, what was his name and number.
I will forward that to my lawyer.

[ABUSE OF POWER CONTINUES...WILL ERIKB EVER STOP?

 Hey Keith:

 Thanks a lot for the letter!

 You know, it does my heart good to hear from such kind and caring
 folks like yourself.  It's so fortunate for the Internet that there are
 people like yourself who take it upon themselves to become martyrs for
 their causes and express their ideals in such an intelligent manner.

 It's fascinating to me that you can send such email sight-unseen.
 Do you know who you are writing to?  Do you even have the slightest
 idea?  What do you hope to accomplish?  Do you have any idea?

 This particular "maladjusted paranoid psychotic" to whom you have so
 eloquently addressed is an engineer in the R&D of a Fortune 500 computer
 company, and that along with outside consulting will net me about
 six-figures this tax year.  I've consulted for telephone companies,
 governments, aerospace, financial institutions, oil companies (the list
 goes on...) and quite frankly I don't do anything even remotely illegal.
 In fact, one recent and quite prominent quote from me was "I only
 hack for money."

 Now, about the silent majority of "honest people" like yourself that you
 have so self-rightously chosen to represent...

 I've been using the net since the early 80's (arpa-days) initially
 through a rms granted guest account on MIT-OZ.  I've continued to
 work with other Internet Providers to cover the asses of the so-called
 "honest people" of which you include yourself.

 Now, in my view, if it were not for people like us, who consistently
 expose and pinpoint weaknesses in the operating systems and networking
 technologies that you use for your "fun and enjoyment" and that I use
 for MY JOB, you would continue to be at serious risk.  But, perhaps
 ignorance is truly bliss, and if so, then Keith, you are probably one of
 the happiest people on this fine planet.

 Now, per your request, I may just go jump in a river, as the one near
 my house is quite nice, and it is almost 100 degrees here in Texas.
 I only ask that you do me one small favor:

 print out 500 copies of this letter, roll them up into a paper fist,
 and shove them into any orifice on your person that meets your criteria
 as deserving.

If you aren't from America, this editorial really isn't meant for you,
so read on with warning, or go on to the next file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stupid hackers.

We've got to do something to clean up our image.

We truly are "America's Most Valuable Resource," as ex-CIA spook Robert
Steele has said so many times.  But if we don't stop screwing over our own
countrymen, we will never be looked at as anything more than common
gutter trash.  Hacking computers for the sole purpose of collecting
systems like space-age baseball cards is stupid, pointless and can only
lead to a quick trip up the river.

Obviously, no one is going to stop hacking.  I've been lucky in that I've
found people willing to pay me to hack for them rather than against
them, but not everyone can score such a coup.  What kind of alternative
can the rest of the community have?

Let's say that everyone was given an opportunity to hack without any
worry of prosecution with free access to a safe system to hack from,
with the only catch being that you could not hack certain systems.
Military, government, financial, commercial and university systems would
all still be fair game.  Every operating system, every application, every
network type all open to your curious minds.

Would this be a good alternative?  Could you follow a few simple
guidelines for the offer of virtually unlimited hacking with no worry of
governmental interference?

Where am I going with this?

Right now we are at war.  You may not realize it, but we all feel the
implications of this war, because it's a war with no allies, and
enormous stakes.  It's a war of economics.

The very countries that shake our hands over the conference tables of
NATO and the United Nations are picking our pockets.  Whether it be the
blatant theft of American R&D by Japanese firms, or the clandestine and
governmentally-sanctioned bugging of Air France first-class seating, or
the cloak-and-dagger hacking of the SWIFT network by the German BND's
Project Rahab, America is getting fucked.

Every country on the planet is coming at us.  Let's face it, we are the
leaders in everything.  Period.  Every important discovery in this
century has been by an American or by an American company.  Certainly
other countries have better profited by our discoveries, but
nonetheless, we are the world's think-tank.

So, is it fair that we keep getting shafted by these so-called "allies?"
Is it fair that we sit idly by, like some old hound too lazy to scratch
at the ticks sucking out our life's blood by the gallon?  Hell no.

Let's say that an enterprising group of computer hackers decided to
strike back.  Using equipment bought legally, using network connections
obtained and paid for legally, and making sure that all usage was
tracked and paid for, this same group began a systematic attack of
foreign computers.  Then, upon having gained access, gave any and all
information obtained to American corporations and the Federal
government.

What laws would be broken?  Federal Computer Crime Statutes specifically
target so-called "Federal Interest Computers." (ie: banks,
telecommunications, military, etc.)  Since these attacks would involve
foreign systems, those statutes would not apply.  If all calls and
network connections were promptly paid for, no toll-fraud or other
communications related laws would apply.

International law is so muddled that the chances of getting extradited
by a country like France for breaking into systems in Paris from Albuquerque
is slim at best.  Even more slim when factoring in that the information
gained was given to the CIA and American corporations.

Every hacking case involving international breakins has been tried and
convicted based on other crimes.  Although the media may spray headlines
like "Dutch Hackers Invade Internet" or "German Hackers Raid NASA,"
those hackers were tried for breaking into systems within THEIR OWN
COUNTRIES...not somewhere else.  8lgm in England got press for hacking
world-wide, but got nailed hacking locally.  Australia's Realm Hackers:
Phoenix, Electron & Nom hacked almost exclusively other countries, but
use of AT&T calling cards rather than Australian Telecom got them a charge
of defrauding the Australian government.  Dutch hacker RGB got huge press
hacking a US military site and creating a "dquayle" account, but got
nailed while hacking a local university.  The list goes on and on.

I asked several people about the workability of my proposal.  Most
seemed to concur that it was highly unlikely that anyone would have to
fear any action by American law enforcement, or of extradition to
foreign soil to face charges there.  The most likely form of retribution
would be eradication by agents of that government.  (Can you say,
"Hagbard?")

Well, I'm willing to take that chance, but only after I get further
information from as many different sources as I can.  I'm not looking
for anyone to condone these actions, nor to finance them.  I'm only
interested in any possible legal action that may interfere with my
freedom.

I'm drafting a letter that will be sent to as many different people as
possible to gather a fully-formed opinion on the possible legal
ramifications of such an undertaking.  The letter will be sent to the FBI,
SS, CIA, NSA, NRO, Joint Chiefs, National Security Council, Congress,
Armed Forces, members of local and state police forces, lawyers, professors,
security professionals, and anyone else I can think of.  Their answers
will help fully form my decision, and perhaps if I pass along their
answers, will help influence other American hackers.

We must take the offensive, and attack the electronic borders of other
countries as vigorously as they attack us, if not more so.  This is
indeed a war, and America must not lose.

->Erik Bloodaxe...Hacker...American.

---------------------------

Ok, so maybe that was a bit much.  But any excuse to hack without fear
should be reason enough to exert a bit of Nationalism.

I'd much rather be taken out by the French in some covert operation and
go out a martyr, than catch AIDS after being raped by the Texas
Syndicate in the metal shop of some Federal Prison.  Wouldn't you?
