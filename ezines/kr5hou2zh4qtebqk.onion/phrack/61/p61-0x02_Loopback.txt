Quote of the day (as seen on irc):
"Give me an eMail and I'll move the world."

We receive a lot of stupid emails as par for the course in each round
of phrack. However, we have some real gems for you this time. Ok, let's
see with what lameness the audience came up with.

Enjoy Loopback :>

Greets.

It occurs to me that an interesting way to generate some operating capital
for Phrack would be to sell to spammers the e-mail addresses of all the
silly newblets that ask for basic hacking tutorials and shit like that.

Granted it wouldn't be financing any phrackmobiles with rocket boosters but
it might pay for a 6-pack for the guy who handles the loopback ;)

Hello anyone,

I am sending out this message to ask for help. I want to learn the basics

    I need to be a haX0r says my mUm.  bcuse I jerk off too much and I need
somthing better to do wiht the 2 hours my mom lets me have to use the
FaMily winbook.  My Unckle billlyfish (his fucking hacksor name) told me
that if I brake N2 nasa and steal the new rockit blueprints then give them
to you so we/you or us/me can get together all of the 0day hackers (im not
gay...just curious) and fly off to amsterdam where Heroin is legal that you
will give me a hard copy set of Phrack issues 1-50.  Piss on them who dont
like shit. lol. hahaha lamers suck.  I am only 27 but I should be sneaking
out of my moms basement soon...like tonight to go to an internet cafe to
masturbate because my 2 hours of Pleasureful winbook time are almost over.
If you can muster up the fucking strengh tell me how to brake into nasa so
i can claim me prize mate I would be as gracious as a dog with peanut
butter Spo0ned up his asS.

    [ Actually you sounded quite smart until the last 2 sentences ]

PS If you make funny out of me then I promise I wont send the rocketshit
planz to you and I will keep them for myself and take all of the hardcopys
out of the back of that mini-gurlish SUV when i gets to holland.  Dig.  By
the way,  after we work out a deal, you can send me my hard copy set
through my paypal account.  (I have the biggest eshop on geocities...)

if i put a disclaimer on my phrack submission, will anyone be able to
prosecute me? in the USA?

    [ Depends on which country you live in. Some countries tend to
      change the law whenever a new president is in charge.
      A disclaimer seldomly helps. Known technniques like leaving the
      country or using an anonymous email account do help. ]

Subject: question

I was wanting to look at your anarchy cookbook iv,ver 4.14. but when i go
to it. it says to  

     " <-------- set your browser to this width minimal ------->".

it say's that if you set your browser to the width proposed, then you'll
have no problem viewing the cookbook.

Question: how do you set your browser to the arrows that you have too - to
be able to view the anarchist cookbook iv, ver 4.14

    [ It's a secret cipher. Put your monitor upside down. There are some
      wheels or some buttons at the bottom of you monitor. Use them to

Hiya guys, Bread here.

    [ HIYA! staff-grunt here. ]

Just thought I'd try and submit an article. If I am
successful, many more articles will be one there way. Its' an article on
the Ping Command which I wrote about a month ago.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy it and are able to actually publish it.
Thanks for your time,
Bread

    [ Can't wait to read the other articles.  Please go ahead an email them
      to us. All the serious articles have to be send to
