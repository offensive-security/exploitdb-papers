Welcome to the next generation of Phrack magazine.  A kinder, gentler, Phrack.
A seasoned, experienced Phrack.  A tawdry, naughty Phrack.  A corpulent, 
well-fed Phrack.  Phrack for the whole family.  Phrack for the kids, Phrack 
for the adults.  Even Phrack for the those enjoying their golden years.

If you thought 48 was a fluke, here is 49, RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.  Full speed 
ahead, baby.  We promised timely Phrack.  We promised quality Phrack.  Here 
are both in ONE CONVENIENT PACKAGE!  We trimmed the fat to bring you the lean
Phrack.  Chock full of the healthy information you need in your diet.  All 
natural.  No artificial ingredients.  No snake oil.  No placebo effect.  
Phrack is full of everything you want, and nothing you don't.
	
This issue is the first *official* offering from the new editorial staff.  If
you missed them, our prophiles can be found in issue 48.  Speaking of 48, 
what a tumultuous situation article 13 caused.  All that wacking SYN flooding.
Well, it got the job done and my point across.  It got vendors and programmers
working to come up with work-around solutions to this age-old problem.  Until 
recently, SYN-flooding was a skeleton in the closet of security professionals.
It was akin the crazy uncle everyone has, who thinks he is Saint Jerome.  We 
all knew it was there, but we ignored it and kinda hoped it would go away...  
Anyway, after this issue, I hope it *will* just go away.  I have done 
interviews for several magazines about the attack and talked until I was blue 
in the face to masses of people.  I think the word is out, the job is done.  
Enough *is* enough. " SYN_flooding=old_hat; ".  Onto bigger and better things.

A few more quick points (after all, you want Phrack Warez, not babbling 
daemon9).  I want to thank the community for supporting me (and co.) thus far.
Countless people have been quite supportive of the Guild, the Infonexus, and 
of Phrack.  Time and work do permit me to get back to all of you individually,
so just a quick blurb here.  Thank you all.  I will be using Phrack as a tool 
to give back to you, so please mail me (or any of the editors with your 
suggestions).  This is *your* magazine.  I just work here.  

Most of all, I am stoked to be here.  I am giving this my all.  I'm fresh, I'm
ready... I'm hyped + I'm amped (most of my heros don't appear on no stamps..).

Drop us a line on what you think of 49.  Comments are encouraged.


Bottom line (and you *can* quote me on this):  Phrack is BACK.

       [ And remember: r00t may own you, but the Guild loves you ]
     [ TNO, on the other hand, doesn't even fucking care you exist ]
