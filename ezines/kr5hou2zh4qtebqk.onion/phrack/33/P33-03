2   Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The original release of this informative file was in an IRG newsletter,
but it had some errors that I wanted to correct.  I have also added more
technical information.

     This file is intended for the newcomer to Internet and people (like
me) who are not enrolled at a university with Internet access.  It covers the
basic commands, the use of Internet, and some tips for hacking through
Internet. There is no MAGICAL way to hacking a UNIX system.  If you have any
questions, I can be reached on a number of boards.

*  - Buffed from UNIX itself.  You will find this on the left side of the
     margin.  This is normally "how to do" or just "examples" of what to do
     when using Internet.

#  - This means these are commands, or something that must be typed in.


4   What is the Internet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     To understand the Internet you must first know what it is.  The Internet
is a group of various networks, ARPANET (an experimental WAN) was the first.
ARPANET started in 1969, this experimental PSN used Network Control Protocol
(NCP).  NCP was the official protocol from 1970 until 1982 of the Internet (at
this time also known as DARPA Internet or ARPA Internet).  In the early 80's
DARPA developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol which is
the official protocol today, but much more on this later.  Due to this fact,
in 1983 ARPANet split into two networks, MILNET and ARPANET (both are still
part of the DDN).

    The expansion of Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN)
helped make the Internet connecting 2,000+ networks strong.  The networks
include NSFNET, MILNET, NSN, ESnet and CSNET.  Though the largest part of the
Internet is in the United States, the Internet still connects the TCP/IP
networks in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and Mexico.


5   Where You Can Access Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Internet is most likely to be found on Local Area Networks or LANs and
Wide Area networks or WANs.  LANs are defined as networks permitting the
interconnection and intercommunication of a group of computers, primarily for
the sharing of resources such as data storage device and printers.  LANs cover
a short distance (less than a mile) and are almost always within a single
building complex.  WANs are networks which have been designed to carry data
calls over long distances (many hundreds of miles).  You can also access
Internet through TymNet or Telenet via gateway.  You'll have to find your own
NUAs though.


6   TAC
~~~~~~~
     TAC (terminal access controller) is another way to access Internet.  This
is just dial-up terminal to a terminal access controller.  You will need to
get a password and an account.  TAC has direct access to MILNET.  One example
of a TAC dialup is (800)368-2217, but there are several out there to be found.
In fact, CERT has a report circulating about people attempting to find these
dialups through social engineering.

     If you want the TAC manual you can write a letter to:

       Defense Communications Agency
       Attn: Code BIAR
       Washington, DC 2o3o5-2ooo

Be sure to write that you want the TAC User Guide, 310-p70-74.

     In order to logon, you will need a TAC Access Card.  You would probably
get it from the DDN NIC.  Here is a sample logon:


Use Control-Q for help...

*
* PVC-TAC 111: 01               \ TAC uses to this to identify itself
* @ #o 124.32.5.82               \ Use ``O'' for open and the internet
*                                / address which yea want to call.
*
* TAC Userid: #THE.GATSBY
* Access Code: #10kgb0124
* Login OK
* TCP trying...Open
*
*


7   Basic Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a:  Basic TELNET Commands

      Situation:  You have an account on a UNIX system that is a host on
Internet.  Now you can access the entire world!  Once the UNIX system you
should see a prompt, which can look like a '$' or '%' (it also depends on what
shell you are in and the type of Unix system).  At the prompt you can do all
the normal UNIX commands, but when on a Internet host you can type 'telnet'
which will bring you to the 'telnet' prompt.

*
* $ #telnet
* ^   ^
  |   |
  |  the command that will bring you to the telnet prompt
  |
  a normal UNIX prompt


     You should get this:

*
* telnet>
*
     At this prompt you will have a whole different set of commands which are
as follows (This comes from UCSD, so it may vary from place to place).

*
* telnet> #help
*
* close           close current connection
* display         display operating parameters
* open            connect to a site
* quit            exit telnet
* send            transmit special character
* set             set operating parameters
* status          print status information
* toggle          toggle operating parameters
* ?               to see what you are looking at now
*

close      - this command is used to 'close' a connection, when multitasking
             or jumping between systems.

display    - this set the display setting, commands for this are as follow.

             ^E    echo.
             ^]    escape.
             ^H    erase.
             ^O    flushoutput.
             ^C    interrupt.
             ^U    kill.
             ^\    quit.
             ^D    eof.


open       - type 'open [host]' to connect to a system

*
* $ #telnet ucsd.edu
*

     or
*
* telnet> #open 125.24.64.32.1
*

quit   - to get out of telnet and back to UNIX
send   - send files
set    - set
echo   - character to toggle local echoing on/off
escape - character to escape back to telnet command mode


     The following need 'localchars' to be toggled:

erase         -  character to cause an Erase Character
flushoutput   -  character to cause an Abort Output
interrupt     -  character to cause an Interrupt Process
kill          -  character to cause an Erase Line
quit          -  character to cause a Break
eof           -  character to cause an EOF
?             -  display help information


b:   ftp ANONYMOUS to a remote site

     ftp or file transfer protocol is used to copy files from a remote host to
the one that you are on.  You can copy anything.  Security has really clamped
down on the passwd file, but it will still work here and there (always worth a
shot).

     This could be useful when you see a Internet CuD (Computer Underground
Digest) site that accepts a anonymous ftps, and you want to read the CuDs, but
do not feel like wasting your time on boards downloading them.  The best way
to start out is to ftp a directory to see what you are getting.

     Example:  The CuD archive site has an Internet address of 192.55.239.132
and my account name is "gats".

*
* $ #ftp
* ^  ^
  |  |
  | ftp command
  |
 UNIX prompt

*
* ftp> #open 192.55.239.132
* Connected to 192.55.239.132
* 220 192.55.239.132 FTP Server (sometimes the date, etc)
* Name (192.55.239.132:gats): #anonymous
*            ^         ^        ^
             |         |        |
             |         |       This is where you type 'anonymous' unless
             |         |     you have a account on 192.55.239.132.
             |         |
             |        This is the name of my account or [from]
             |
            This is the Internet address or [to]
*
* Password: #gats
*            ^
             |
            For this just type your username or anything you feel like typing
            in at that time.  It doesn't matter.

*
* % ftp 192.55.239.132
* Connected to 192.55.239.132
* ftp> #ls
*       ^
        |
       You are connected now, thus you can ls it.

     Just move around like you would in a normal unix system.  Most of the
commands still apply on this connection. Here is a example of me getting a
copy of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Effector (issue 1.04) from
Internet address 192.55.239.132.

*
* % #ftp
* ftp> #open 128.135.12.60
* Trying 128.135.12.60...
* 220 chsun1 FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready.
* Name (128.135.12.60:gatsby): anonymous

     To read the file you can just 'get' the file and buffer it.  If the files
are just too long, you can 'xmodem' it off the host you are on.  Just type
'xmodem' and that will make it much faster to get the files.  Here is the set
up (as found on ocf.berkeley.edu).

   If you want to:                                         type:

send a text file from an apple computer to the ME       xmodem ra <filename>
send a text file from a non-apple home computer         xmodem rt <filename>
send a non-text file from a home computer               xmodem rb <filename>
send a text file to an apple computer from the ME       xmodem sa <filename>
send a text file to a non-apple home computer           xmodem st <filename>
send a non-text file to a home computer                 xmodem sb <filename>

xmodem will then display:

*
* XMODEM Version 3.6 -- UNIX-Microcomputer Remote File Transfer Facility
* File filename Ready to (SEND/BATCH RECEIVE) in (binary/text/apple) mode
* Estimated File Size (file size)
* Estimated transmission time (time)
* Send several Control-X characters to cancel
*


Hints- File transfer can be an iffy endeavor; one thing that can help is to
       tell the annex box not to use flow control.  Before you do rlogin, type

 stty oflow none
 stty iflow none

at the annex prompt.  This works best coming through 2-6092.

    Some special commands used during ftp session are cdup (same as cd ..) and
dir (gives a detailed listing of the files).


c:   How to tftp the Files

     tftp (Trivial File Transfer Protocol, the command is NOT in caps, because
UNIX is case sensitive) is a command used to transfer files from host to host.
This command is used sometimes like ftp, in that you can move around using
UNIX commands.  I will not go into this part of the command, but I will go
into the basic format, and structure to get files you want. Moreover, I will
be covering how to flip the /etc/passwd out of remote sites.
     There is a little trick that has been around a while.  It helps you to
"flip" the /etc/passwd file out of different sites, which gets you the passwd
file without out breaking into the system.  Then just run Brute Hacker (the
latest version) on the thing and you save time and energy.  This 'hole' (not
referring to the method of obtaining Unix superuser status) may can be found
on SunOS 3.X, but has been fixed in 4.0.  It has sometimes appeared in
System V, BSD and a few others.

     The only problem with this 'hole' is that the system manager will often
realize what you are doing.  The problem occurs when attempts to tftp the
/etc/passwd is happen too many times.  You may see this (or something like
this) when you logon on to your account.  This was buffered off of
plague.berkeley.edu.  I guess they knew what I was doing.

*
* DomainOS Release 10.3 (bsd4.3) Apollo DN3500 (host name):
*         This account has been deactivated due to use in system cracking
* activities (specifically attempting to tftp /etc/passwd files from remote
* sites) and for having been used or broken in to from <where the calls are
* from>.  If the legitimate owner of the account wishes it reactivated,
* please mail to the staff for more information.
*
* - Staff
*

     The tftp is used in this format:

 tftp -<command> <any name> <Internet Address>  /etc/passwd  <netascii>

Command      -g   is to get the file, this will copy the file onto
                  your 'home' directory, thus you can do anything with
                  the file.

Any Name     If your going to copy it to your 'home' directory, it needs a
             name.

Internet     This is the address that you want to snag the passwd file from.
 Address     There are hundreds of thousands of them.

/ETC/PASSWD  THIS IS THE FILE THAT YOU WANT.  You do not want John Smith's
             even though it would be trivial to retreive it.

netascii     This how you want the file to be transferred.

&            Welcome to the power of UNIX, it is multitasking, this little
             symbol place at the end will allow you to do other things (such
             as grab the passwd file from the UNIX that you are on).

     Here is the set up:  We want to get the passwd file from
sunshine.ucsd.edu.  The file in your 'home' directory is going to be named
'asunshine'.

*
* $ #tftp -g asunshine sunshine.ucsd.edu /etc/passwd &
*


d  Basic Fingering

     Fingering is a real good way to get an account on remote sites.  Typing
'who' or just 'finger <account name> <CR>' you can have names to "finger".
This will give you all kinds information on the person's account.  Here is a
example of how to do it:

*
* % #who
* joeo                 ttyp0       Jun 10 21:50   (bmdlib.csm.edu)
* gatsby               ttyp1       Jun 10 22:25   (foobar.plague.mil)
* ddc                  crp00       Jun 10 11:57   (aogpat.cs.pitt.edu)
* liliya               display     Jun 10 19:40

                 /and fingering what you see

* % #finger bbc
* Login name: ddc                     In real life: David Douglas Cornwall
* Office: David C. Co
* Directory: //aogpat/users_local/bdc     Shell: /bin/csh
* On since Jun 10 11:57:46 on crp00 from aogpat   Phone 555-1212
* 52 minutes Idle Time
* Plan:  I like to eat apples and bananas.
* %
*

     Now you could just call (or Telnet to) 'aogpat.cs.pit.edu' and try to
hack out an account.  Try the last name as the password, the first name, the
middle name, and try them all backwards.  The chances are real good that you
WILL get in because people are stupid.

     If there are no users online for you to type "who" you can just type
"last" and all of the users who logged on will come rolling out.  Now "finger"
them.  The only problem with using the "last" command is aborting it.

     You can also try telephoning individual users and tell them you are the
system manager (i.e. social engineer them).  However, I have not always seen
phone numbers in everyone's ".plan" file (the file you see when you finger the
user).

9  Internet Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     TCP/IP is a general term relating to the whole family of Internet
protocols.  The protocols in this family are IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ROSE, ACSE,
CMIP, ISO, ARP and Ethernet for LANs.  If if you want more information, get
the RFCs.

      TCP/IP protocol is a "layered" set of protocols.  In this diagram taken
from RFC 1180 you will see how the protocol is layered when connection is
made.

  Ethernet Cable

TCP/IP:  If connection is made is between the IP module and the TCP module the
         packets are called a TCP datagram.  TCP is responsible for making
         sure that the commands get through the other end.  It keeps track of
         what is sent, and retransmits anything that does not go through.  The
         IP provides the basic service of getting TCP datagram from place to
         place.  It may seem like the TCP is doing all the work, this is true
         in small networks, but when connection is made to a remote host on
         the Internet (passing through several networks) this is a complex
         job. Say I am connected from a server at UCSD to LSU (SURAnet) the
         data grams have to pass through a NSFnet backbone.  The IP has to
         keep track of all the data when the switch is made at the NSFnet
         backbone from the TCP to the UDP.  The only NSFnet backbone that
         connects LSU is the University of Maryland, which has different
         circuit sets.  The cable (trunk)/circuit types are the T1 (a basic
         24-channel 1.544 Md/s pulse code modulation used in the US) to a
         56 Kbps.  Keeping track of all the data from the switch from T1 to
         56Kbs and TCP to UDP is not all it has to deal with.  Datagrams on
         their way to the NSFnet backbone (at the University of Maryland) may
         take many different paths from the UCSD server.

         All the TCP does is break up the data into datagrams (manageable
         chunks), and keeps track of the datagrams.  The TCP keeps track of
         the datagrams by placing a header at the front of each datagram.  The
         header contains 160 (20 octets) pieces of information about the
         datagram.  Some of this information is the FQDN (Fully Qualified
         Domain Name).  The datagrams are numbers in octets (a group of eight
         binary digits, say there are 500 octets of data, the numbering of the
         datagrams would be 0, next datagram 500, next datagram 1000, 1500
          etc.

UDP/IP:  UDP is one of the two main protocols of the IP.  In other words the
         UDP works the same as TCP, it places a header on the data you send,
         and passes it over to the IP for transportation throughout the
         Internet.  The difference is that it offers service to the user's
         network application.  It does not maintain an end-to-end connection,
         it just pushes the datagrams out.

ICMP:  ICMP is used for relaying error messages.  For example you might try to
       connect to a system and get a message back saying "Host unreachable",
       this is ICMP in action.  This protocol is universal within the
       Internet, because of its nature.  This protocol does not use port
       numbers in it's headers, since it talks to the network software itself.


Ethernet:  Most of the networks use Ethernet.  Ethernet is just a party line.
           When packets are sent out on the Ethernet, every host on the
           Ethernet sees them.  To make sure the packets get to the right
           place, the Ethernet designers wanted to make sure that each address
           is different.  For this reason 48 bits are allocated for the
           Ethernet address, and a built in Ethernet address on the Ethernet
           controller.

           The Ethernet packets have a 14-octet header, this includes address
           "to" and "from."  The Ethernet is not too secure, it is possible to
           have the packets go to two places, thus someone can see just what
           you are doing.  You need to take note that the Ethernet is not
           connected to the Internet.  A host on both the Ethernet and on the
           Internet has to have both an Ethernet connection and an Internet
           server.

ARP:  ARP translates the IP address into an Ethernet address.  A conversion
      table is used (the table is called ARP Table) to convert the addresses.
      Therefore, you would never even know if you were connected to the
      Ethernet because you would be connecting to the IP address.

      The following is a real sketchy description of a few Internet protocols,
      but if you would like to get more information you can access it via
      anonymous ftp from several hosts.  Here is a list of RFCs that deal with
      the topic of protocols.

10  Host Name and Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Internet addresses are long and difficult hard to remember (i.e.,
128.128.57.83) so we use host names.  All hosts registered on the Internet
must have names that reflect them domains under which they are registered.
Such names are called Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).  Lets dissect a
name and see the domains:

 lilac.berkeley.edu
   ^      ^      ^
   |      |      |
   |      |      |____  "edu" shows that this host is sponsored by an
   |      |             education related organization.  This is a top-level
   |      |             domain.
   |      |
   |      |___________  "berkeley" is the second-level domain.  This shows
   |                    that it is an organization within University of
   |                    Calironia at  Berkeley.
   |
   |__________________  "lilac" is the third-level domain.  This indicates the
                        local host name is 'lilac'.

     Common Top-Level Domains

     COM  -  commercial enterprise
     EDU  -  educational institutions
     GOV  -  nonmilitary government agencies
     MIL  -  military (non-classified)
     NET  -  networking entities
     ORG  -  nonprofit intuitions

     A network address is the numerical address of a host, gateway, or TAC.
The addresses are made up of four decimal numbered slots, which are separated
by a period.

     There are three classes that are used most, these are Class A, Class B,
and Class C.

   Class A  -  from '0'    to  '127'
   Class B  -  from '128'  to  '191'
   Class C  -  from '192'  to  '223'

Class A  -  Is for MILNET net hosts.  The first part of the address has the
            network number.  The second is for the physical PSN port number.
            The third is for the logical port number, since it is on MILNET,
            it is a MILNET host.  The fourth part is for which PSN it is on.
            On 29.34.0.9.  '29' is the network it is on.  '34' means it is on
            port '34'.  '9' is the PSN number.

Class B  -  This is for the Internet hosts, the first two "clumps" are for the
            network portion.  The second two are for the local port.

             128.28.82.1
               \_/   \_/
                |     |_____ Local portion of the address
                |
                |___________ Potation address.

Class C  -  The first three "clumps" are the network portion and the last one
            is the local port.

            193.43.91.1
               \_|_/  |_____ Local Portation Address
                 |
                 |__________ Network Portation Address
_______________________________________________________________________________
