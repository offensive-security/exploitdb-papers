|=------------------------=[ The UNIX Terrorist ]=----------------------=|
|=----------------------------------------------------------------------=|


In this issue of Phrack, we have renewed with publishing the prophile
of an influencial underground character. The UNIX terrorist was already
prophiled two years ago but for some editorial reasons at the time, we 
were not able to get his prophile published. Now that the Phrack editorial 
staff has less open conflicts with some part of the scene represented by 
the_uT, we want to make sure everyone remember his engagement. A lot of 
people believed he was an extremist blackhat hacker proning non-disclosure
during his time of activity. That was true. But he was not just this.

I have known the UNIX Terrorist in real life seven years ago. At this time,
during his youth, the_uT was a softer hacker. Dont get me wrong, the_uT 
(or whatever he was calling himself before) always had this characteristic
personality that made him an exceptionally creative dude. Later on, after 
he started body-building (rumors mention that he followed the advices of 
his idol Mike Shifman), he got that impressive shape that certainly 
represented better his mind shift towards a more aggressive prophile. The 
UNIX terrorist is the result of this evolution from a young skilled hacker 
to a disabused philosopher of the underground.

This prophile was realized by The Paper Street Hacker in November 2007
for publication in Phrack Magazine #65 by TCLH. Remember the opinion 
reflected in this interview only engages the UNIX Terrorist and does not 
represent the opinion of the Phrack editors. 

So here it is.

	    Codez: stealthrm, the first blackhat RM(1) utility, designed
	           to rm desktop computers silently. Distributed as a 
                   Linux LKM, VFS functions are hijacked so that file 
                   indexing and rm'ing can be smuggled and interleaved 
                   discretely amongst existing file operations. 
                   Additionally, keyboard I/O is monitored to determine 
                   the sysadmin's presence. Sporadic file wiping occurs 
                   either during heavy PLANNED system hard drive use, or 
                   occurs slowly and steadily, with timed delays, while 
                   the console user is absent. The primary purpose is to 
                   avoid the alarming and sickeningly unexpected HDD 
                   "crunching" sound that alerts many would-be "rm -rf /"
		   victims to their impending doom. File removal is 
                   scheduled according to a proprietary prioritization 
                   algorithm whose factors include criteria such as 
                   inode atimes and VFS type. Files are secure DOD-wiped 
                   in place, but not unlinked, preserving disk statistics.

|=---=[ Your current life in a paragraph


         I'll give you a hint... it doesn't involve getting paid to do
	 computer security research. The only reason I would even 
         consider using a computer anymore would be to meet women of 
         loose moral standards on myspace, or to engage in the wholesale
         piracy of music and video content, preferrably violent 
         pornography. Or maybe to get directions to a strip club on 
         mapquest... or order various scheduled substances from corrupt
         Eastern European pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities... In 
         fact, if you're reading my prophile because you just happened 
         still to be reading Phrack in 2008 and stumbled upon it, then 
         I pity you... you fucking closet homosexual.

|=---=[ First contact with computers

	 Studying the mysteries of gorillas.bas and nibbles.bas,
	 oldstyle!

|=---=[ Youth

	 I was 300 lbs, bespectacled, and acne-stricken. I used to read
	 copies of Dr. Dobb's Journal in P.E. Everybody hated me. Then I
	 underwent an emergency negroplasty and decided to enact my 
         revenge upon the world by inflicting massive verbal trauma 
         through a medium where personal interaction is impossible and 
         everybody feels tougher than they really are. So I installed 
         BitchX and went on EFNET, and the rest, my friend, is history.

|=---=[ Passions : What makes you tick

	 I'm distinguished by an acutely defined and unparalleled sense
	 of schadenfreude. Technology is pretty fun too (or at least it 
         was for a while), but what really drove me harder and further 
         was the exciting possibility of using computers to turn the 
         life of a particular fellow human being into a living hell.
	 So no, I wasn't that kid that used to hang out at Radio Shack
	 pulling apart electronic equipment and reassembling it to "see 
         how it works." Shit like that doesn't make you a "hacker" - it 
         makes you a wannabe EE undergrad. Driving people over the 
         precipices of depair and frustration is a great way to
	 pass one's time, but definitely falls short of the pleasure of
	 discrediting or humiliating or otherwise defaming and 
         slandering the ill-earned reputations of the various charlatans 
         and hypocrites in the scene. Publishing the mail spoolz of
	 the wicked, archiving the hard drives of the lame, and rm'ing
	 the weak are all activities I find inspirational. Particularly, 
         I choose to self-medicate my anomie by proving myself smarter 
         and stronger than others. This is the sort of thing with which 
         we'll have to make do until we can one day stalk elk around the
	 ruins of the Rockefeller Center or strip venison in the empty
	 carpool lanes of some abandoned superhighway. For further 
         information about what makes me "tick," please consult Dr. Neal
	 Krawetz's remarkable and highly academic psychological exegesis,
	 fully annotated to official APA formatting standards.

|=---=[ Entrance in the underground

	 It all began on EFNET, some time around 1998 (long before they
	 had CHANFIX like dalnet!) in lame and lamer channels like #b4b0 
         and #feed-the-goats. Historical note: Several incredibly 
         diabolical and motivated individuals from b4b0 would come to 
         rule the virtual entirety of the Interweb with an iron fist for 
         the following decade. Yeah, I started hacking shit virtually 
         exclusively on TCP/IP networks, and started writing exploits 
         long after techniques like heap overflows and return-into-libc 
         were published, so fuck you if you have a problem with the fact 
         that I never scanned shit with toneloc or bruteforced SPRINTNET 
         logins.
	 
|=---=[ Which research have you done or which one gave you the most fun?

	 Writing any one of several reliable exploits for intelligently
	 brute-forcing complex remote vulnerabilities, which all made me 
         feel like a hacker from THE MATRIX. Especially writing a 
         universal blind exploit for the Wu-FTPD globbing vuln for 
         versions 2.5.x-2.6.1 (cmdtab power!), and porting the remote
	 client for CORE-SDI's ingenious crc32 deattack backdoor to more
	 exotic operating systems such as Solaris and IRIX (possibly the 
         world's slowest exploit). Also, writing an LKM for dynamically 
         loadable stack/heap execution protection on Linux.
				    
|=---=[ How started low-level ?

	 Like most other "underground" groups out there, this one started
	 from the flawed notion that it would somehow be cool to get a 
         group of people together with a webpage and domain name and IRC 
         channel and write a bunch of POC code and publish it to the 
         public and post on sec lists for attention. It was a stupid 
         idea.

|=---=[ Personal general opinion about the underground

	 Well, the underground is pretty much dead, but I guess you
	 mostly have the security researchers out there to thank for that
         one. However, as a delicious proof of the old adage "be careful 
         what you wish for," security professionals have made their own 
         demand scarce. With vulnerabilities so much harder to find,
	 it means that random idiots out there aren't likely to find
	 anything remotely useful by grep'ing for overflows in unsafe C 
         functions. The first sign that things were about to dry out 
         occurred during the format bug craze in 2000, which resulted in 
         the systematic scanning of all varargs style functions that were
	 incorrectly used - the first time an entire class of 
         vulnerabilities has been nearly perfectly eradicated in a body 
         of open source code. Slowly over time, the same thing has 
         happened to most other memory and integer overflows, and casting
         bugs. What happens as a result? 0day becomes a highly valued 
         commodity. The chance of leakage decreases dramatically because:
	 
         1. 0day is much more valuable
	 
         2. Few people can find useful vulns, which decreases the amount
	 of sharing. Additionally, smarter people usually find an 
         intrinsically higher value in their own work than people that 
         can't understand the exploits they're using.
	 
         3. "When guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns" -
	 Praise be to Allah and the fact that the divine mathematics of
         exploit creation are now made sacred by entities like WIPO and 
         the DMCA. For nearly a decade, security companies relied on FUD
         and fearmongering, heralding the imminent spread of global 
         cyber-warfare and e-terror. A particularly salient example of 
         this idiocy would be the infamous Aris Threatcon, second in its
	 contemptibility only to the Homeland Security Advisory meter. 
         These scare tactics worked for a while, as sec. companies 
         boosted sales of products such as firewalls, packet filters, 
         network scanners, and other useless trash by relentlessly
	 trumpeting the seriousness of various "hacker" threats and by
	 strategically scaring the public with their own original 
         (mostly stolen) advisories. Ironically, they ended up scaring 
         legislators more than the commercial sector, and now people 
         like Dmitry Skylarov are arrested for publishing their
	 "astonishing!" findings. Note to security companies: you're 
         attempting to be both the cause and the cure and we've got 
         use for neither.
	 
         4. 0day auctions: Blackhats finally realize that it's a lot
	 more lucrative to sell exploit information to shadowy interest 
         groups. Such sales have the added benefit of preventing 
         information dissemination, because it works against the 
         interests of all parties involved. iDEFENSE, the first and
	 largest name in hacking middlemanry, was forced to purchase 
         exploits from the underground when they realized they lacked 
         the technical skills in their meager R&D labs to find any 
         exploits on their own. But who in their right mind would 
         consider auctioning off vulns at Argentinian prices to a 
         whitehat sweatshop that will just pawn their findings off as 
         their own, and then publish them to Bugtraq - when they can make
         the same sale to somebody in the underground for 5-10x the cost 
         and rest assured that the vuln will stay alive?

	 Nowadays, it is claimed that the Chinese and even WOMEN are
	 hacking things. Man, am I ever glad I got a chance to experience 
         "the scene" before it degenerated completely. And remember, kids,
         knowing how to program or wanting really badly to figure out how 
         things work inside doesn't make you a hacker! Hacking boxes
	 makes you a "hacker" ! That's right! Write your local
         representatives at Wikipedia/urbandictionary/OED and let them 
         know that hackers are people that gain unauthorized 
         access/privileges to computerized systems! Linus Torvalds
	 isn't a hacker! Richard Stallman isn't a hacker! Niels Provos
	 isn't a hacker! Fat/ugly, maybe! Hackers, no! And what is up with
         the use of the term "cracker"? As far as I'm concerned, that term
         applies to people that bypass copyright protection mechanisms. 
         Vladimir Levin? HACKER. phiber optik? HACKER. Kevin Mitnick? OK, 
         maybe a gay/bad one, but still WAS a "hacker." Hope that's clear.

|=---=[ How started PR0J3KT M4YH3M ?

	 The idea obviously isn't something entirely new or original. 
         The earliest known historical precursor to Project Mayhem was
         Erostratus, who set fire to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus,
	 one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Though his
	 motives were questionable (he achieved the act merely because 
         he had no other way of immortalizing his name), the base concept
         was there: destroying something beautiful just for the hell of
	 it. Note: destruction and vandalism out of ignorance and fear 
         are decidedly less noble in nature. Obviously, there was some
	 inspiration from the novel, Fight Club. As far as scene-related
	 influences, there were some early precursors... the venerable 
         e-zine "CITADEL" and some of the better work of BOW (Brotherhood
         of Warez). ~el8 was probably the single biggest source of 
         creative energy fueling PR0J3KT M4YH3M, and is still 
         remembered to this day as the greatest, most revolutionary
	 blackhat publication of all time. But what really kick-started
	 PR0J3KT M4YH3M was the apparent lack of success of 
         anti.security.is, a formal anti-disclosure movement constructed
         from a lucid and cogent document illustrating why it would be 
         better for all parties in the infosec community to stop 
         publishing exploit code. But as the US government is fond of 
         saying of the Taliban, it soon occurred to many of us that 
         these whitehats, like their white-turbaned friends in 
         Afghanistan, "respond only to violence." Enter PR0J3KT M4YH3M,
	 a spawn off PHC's Fight Club division. All in all, PR0J3KT 
         M4YH3M had an impressive run, resulting in the ownage of high
	 profile whitehats including Theo de Raadt, Kevin Mitnick,
	 and Marty Roesch. IRC servers were conquered and their 
         operators were vanquished. Prominent "hacker" magazines were 
         stolen and leaked prematurely. Hard drives were dd'ed, 
         tar'ed, gzipped', gpg'ed, and shipped off to snu.ac.kr.
	 Codes of whitehats were backdoored and published
	 unexpectedly. Violent/offensive/sacrilegious blackhat 
	 ASCII art was created. Heap exploitation tutorials were
	 rebranded. Hitlists of the whitehat community were 
         compiled. Info-security professionals were fired. Whitehat 
         books & movies were leaked. g4yh1tl3r lived, died, and was born 
         again. And we all had a lot of fun.

	 on Youtube (see "Budd Dwyer" Wikipedia for ideas).
	 If you're looking for repulsive female companionship or fellow
	 loser friends to socialize with "IRL," you'll probably save 
         some time and airfare by checking your local Craigslist first.
	 Otherwise, the proof is in the pudding. 10 years ago it would
	 been inconceivable that there would one day be "security 
         conferences" in retard 3rd world shitpile countries like Mexico,
         Malaysia, and Pakistan. Countries whose only contributions to 
         the progression of the digital age
	 have been the vigorous repeated typing of "jajaja" and "kekeke"
	 and "gf0rce pakistan!!!" in
	 various IRC channels and online message boards. Apparently,
	 high tech vocations have taken
	 over! My suggestion is to stock up on sombreros, Nikes, and
	 taxi cab medallions now before
	 they become relics of the past.

|=---=[ Opinion on Phrack Magazine 1985' ? 1995' ? 2005' ? '2007 ?
	 
         I've always thought this magazine sucked, but in regards to
	 the specifics of the question at hand, it's probably gotten 
         steadily worse over time. OK OK... I'm sure the editorial staff
	 would like me to say something positive here so here's my best
	 attempt: "PHRACK MAGAZINE - Hey, at least it's not 2600!"
	 This will probably be the worst issue yet, but that's fine -
	 I'm just using this prophile as a mouthpiece for my dogma of 
         physical anabolism and moral decay.

|=---=[ What you would like to see published in Phrack ?

	 An article on phones! (Not VOIP!)
	 Definitely more mail spools... a renewed focus on homemade
	 improvised explosive devices... maybe even some tutorials on
         drug trafficking for newbies

|=---=[ Anything more you want to say 

	 Looking back on my involvement in computers, I am very happy
	 that the peak of my activity occurred right during the turn 
         of the 20th century. Hacking was no longer as simple as manual 
         labor (wardialing etc.) but finding vulnerabilities and writing 
         exploits and tools was not exactly as tedious and prohibitively 
         time-consuming as it is currently. To say that I would rather 
         commit seppuku than adapt to the challenges of a changing world 
         by auditing code for SQL injection vulnerabilities and 
         client-side browser exploits is not an exaggeration. On the 
         upside of things, hardcore pornography is now far better and 
         more widely and freely available than ever, and productive
	 programming like UFC can be seen on channels like Spike TV for
	 free. Every day, more and more youngsters are born who are many
         times more likely to contribute articles to socially useful 
         publications such as Encyclopedia Dramatica instead of 2600. 
         Spreading terror and wreaking havoc for "epic lulz" have been 
         established as viable alternatives to contributing to open 
         source software projects. If you're a kid reading this zine for
	 the first time because you're interested in becoming a hacker,
	 fucking forget it. You're better off starting a collection of 
         poached adult website passwords, or hanging out on 4chan. At 
         least trash like this has some modicum of entertainment value,
         whereas the hacking/security scene had become some kind of 
         fetid sinkhole for all the worst kinds of recycled academic 
         masturbation imaginable. In summary, the end is fucking nigh, 
         and don't tell me I didn't warn you... even though there's 
         nothing you can do about it. 
         
         Good night and good luck,
         - the UNIX TERRORIST
