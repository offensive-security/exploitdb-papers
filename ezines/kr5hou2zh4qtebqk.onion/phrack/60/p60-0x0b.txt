--[ 1 - Introduction


   In this article, I will try to explain what CIFS and SMB are , how
it works and some common insecurities present on these protocols.
This article constitue  a useful source of knowledge about Microsoft 
networking. The SMB protocol is one of the most used protocols on LAN.
I have also included source code in the aim of giving a good expamle 
of SMB operating.

   You will learn how to use ARP poisoning to have password in clear 
from the network when all SMB passwords are encrypted (without brute 
forcing). You will be able to understand the link between SMB and 
NETBIOS. You will also learn what is and how works the Microsoft 
Remote Administration Protocol (RAP) for scanning remote shares on a
SMB server.

   Programs and information are given for educational purpose only. 
I could be not responsable of what you will make with.

--[ 2 - What is SMB/CIFS ?


According to Microsoft CIFS is intended to provide an open cross-
platform mechanism for client systems to request file and print 
services from server systems over a network. It is based on the
standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol widely in use by 
personal computers and workstations running a wide variety of 
operating systems.

In fact, SMB (for Server Message Block) is a protocol which operates
the data transfert between sharing files, devices, named pipes 
or mail slot across a network. CIFS is a public version of SMB.

SMB clients available :

 from Microsoft : Windows 95, Windows for workgroups 3.x, 
 Windows NT,2000 and XP

 for Linux :
 Smblient from Samba
 Smbfs for Linux

SMB servers :
 Samba
 Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.x
 Microsoft Windows 95
 Microsoft Windows NT 
 The PATHWORKS family of servers from Digital
 LAN Manager for OS/2,SCO,etc
 VisionFS from SCO
 TotalNET Advanced Server from Syntax
 Advanced Serverfor UNIX from AT&T (NCR?)
 LAN Server for OS/2 from IBM.

--[ 3 - Session establishment


   Note : SMB protocol was developed to run on DOS ( powered by an 
Intel chip) so byte ordering is little-endian the opposite of network
 ordering.

   SMB can run over TCP/IP, NetBEUI, DECnet Protocol and IPX/SPX. 
With a SMB implementation over TCP/IP, DECnet or NETBEUI, the 
NETBIOS names must be use.

   I will explain in the sixth chapter what NETBIOS is. But for the 
moment, you just have to know that a NETBIOS name identifies one computer
on a Microsoft network.

   The development of SMB has begun in the eighties, so there is a lot
of versions of the SMB protocol. But the most used (on Windows 95, 
98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and XP) is the NT LM 0.12 
version. This article is based on the NT LM 0.12 version.

   You have to know that a SMB Domain name identifies a group of 
ressource (users, printers, files ..) on a SMB server.

How does a client establish a SMB session with a server ?


   Let's take this situation : a client  wants to access to a specific
ressource on a server.

1 - To begin the client requests the server for a NETBIOS session. 
The client sends his encoded NETBIOS name to the SMB server 
(which listening connection requests on port 139). 
The server receives the NETBIOS name and replies with a NETBIOS 
session packet to valid the session. The client enters after in a 
SMB session establishment i.e the identification of the client 
to the SMB server.

2 - The client sends a SMB negprot request packet (negprot for 
"negotiate protocol"). The client gives a list of SMB protocol 
versions supported.
Then the server sends a SMB negprot reply packet (with informations 
like SMB domain name, maximun connections accepted, 
SMB protocol versions supported ...)

3 - After the negotiation of protocols, the client processes to a user
or share identification on the server.(see the next chapter to know 
 what is the difference between a share and a user identification)

This process is operated by the SesssetupX request packet (SesssetupX 
for Session Setup and X).
The client sends a couple login/password or a simple password to the 
server that refuses or allows the conection with a SessetupX reply 
packet.

4 - Ok, when the client has finished with negotiation and identification
it sends a tconX packet for specifying the network name of the ressource
that it wants to access, and the server sends a Tconx reply indicating 
if the connection is accepted or not.

                                      (netbios name)
              [client]       --------------------------->   [server]

A complete description of each packets is given in the chapter six.


--[ 4 - Security level of SMB 
 

There is two types of security models on SMB :

   The first is  the "Share level" security model. This security model
associates a password to a shared ressource on the network. The user 
logs to this ressource (IPC, Disk, Printers) with the correct password.
The user is anyone on the network who knows the name of the server where 
the ressource is.

   The second is the "User Level". This security model is an enhanced
implementation of the first. It consists to associate a couple of 
login/password to a shared ressource. So if a person wants to 
connect to this shared ressource, he has to know the login/password 
couple. This security level is useful to know who makes what.


--[ 5 - Passwords


   With SMB, when you have to make an identification on a server, your
password could be sent in clear or encrypted. If the server supports
encryption, the client will have to answer a challenge. The server
knows the password, so in the negprot reply packet, an encryption key
will be send to the client. The client encrypts the password,
and sends it in the SesssetupX request packet, the server verifies the
validity of the password and allows the session or not.

You have to know that a SMB password (not encrypted) is 14 bytes 
long maximum. The size of the encryption key is usually 8 bytes long.
The size of the encrypted password is 24 bytes. With ANSI password, the
characters of the password are converted in upper case for the 
encryption.

The password is encrypted with a DES encryption in block mode.


--[6 - Description of several SMB packets


   In this part I will give the description of the most important 
packets types involved in SMB protocol. I know it's a bit boring 
but this is the base to understand how works SMB and the attacks.
I will explain what is very important in each type of packet.
For each type of command correspond two types of packets. The request 
packet and the reply packet.

----[ 6.1 - The general aspect of a SMB packet.


   In the majority of case SMB runs over TCP/IP protocol suite. 
So let's consider that SMB runs over TCP layer for us. Over the TCP 
layer, you will always find the NETBIOS (NBT) header. Over NBT you 
have the SMB base header. Over the SMB base header, you have an 
another type of header, which depends of the specific command you 
request.

                    ----------------------
                    |      TCP header    |
                    ----------------------
                    |   NETBIOS header   |
                    ----------------------
                    |   SMB base header  |
                    ----------------------
                    | SMB Command header |
                    ----------------------
                    |        DATA        |
                    ----------------------
			      
The "SMB Base header" contains several informations, like the size of 
reception buffers, maximum connexions allowed... It also contains a 
number that identifies the command requested. 

"SMB command header" is a header with all the parameters for the 
requested command (a command like negotiate protocol versions ... )

"DATA" is the data for the requested command.

I call "SMB packet", the NETBIOS Header + the SMB base header +
the SMB Command header + DATA.

NOTE :  I will use this definitions :

typedef unsigned char UCHAR;          // 8 unsigned bits
typedef unsigned short USHORT;        // 16 unsigned bits
typedef unsigned long ULONG;          // 32 unsigned bits

and STRING defined a null terminated ASCII string. 


----[ 6.2 - NETBIOS and SMB


NETBIOS (for NETwork Basic Input and Outpout System) is widely use 
on Microsoft networks. It is a sofware interface and a naming system.
Each computer has a NETBIOS name, which is 15 characters long, and a 
sixteenth character is used to identify the type of computer 
( Domain Name server, workstation...).

Value for the sixteenth character :

0x00 base computer, workstation.
0x20 resource sharing server.

There are other values but these are the most interessant for us. The 
first (0x00) identify a workstation and the second (0x20) the server. 

On a SMB packet, the NETBIOS header corresponds to the NETBIOS 
Session header, defined like this :
 
                UCHAR Type;   	// Type of the packet
                UCHAR Flags;  	// Flags
                USHORT Length;	// Count of data bytes (netbios header
                                                        not included)
	      
For the "Flags" field, the value is always 0. (with SMB, not in general !)

For the "Type" field, several values are possible :

               0x81 corresponds to a NETBIOS session request. This code
is used when the client sends its NETBIOS name to the server.

               0x82 is a positive response to a NETBIOS session request.
This code is used by the server to authorize a NETBIOS session. 

               0x00 correspond to a session message. This code is always 
used in a SMB session i.e when the client has sent his NETBIOS name to 
the server and has received a positive reply.	       
	       
The "Length" field contains a count of data bytes (The netbios header 
is not included), "data" means what is above the NETBIOS header (it 
could be the SMB Base header + SMB Command header + DATA or NETBIOS 
names). 

NETBIOS names and encoding


A NETBIOS encoded name is 32 bytes long.

A NETBIOS name is always given in upper case characters.

It's very easy to encode a NETBIOS name. For example the NETBIOS name 
of my computer is "BILL" and it's a workstation so there is a "0x00"
for the sixteenth character.

Firstly, when a NETBIOS name is shorter than 15 bytes, it may be padded
on the right with spaces.

     "BILL           "      

In hexadecimal  0x42 0x49 0x4c 0x4c 0x20 0x20 ......0x00

Each bytes are splited into 4-bit halves.

0x4 0x2 0x4 0x9 0x4 0xc 0x4 0xc 0x2 0x0 .......

And each 4-bit half is added to the ASCII value of the 'A' letter (0x41)

0x4 + 0x41 = 0x45  -> ASCII value = E

0x2 + 0x41 = 0x43  -> ASCII value = C
...

And you have the encoded NETBIOS name which is 32 bytes long.

Note :

 SMB can run directly over TCP without NBT (it's supported on Win2k 
and XP on port 445). The NETBIOS name are not limited to 15 characters. 

You don't need to know more, if you want to have more information 
about NETBIOS read [3] and [4].

----[ 6.3 - The SMB base header    


This header is used in all SMB packets, this is its definition :

    UCHAR Protocol[4];                // Contains 0xFF,'SMB'
    UCHAR Command;                    // Command code
    union {
        struct {
            UCHAR ErrorClass;         // Error class
            UCHAR Reserved;           // Reserved for future use
            USHORT Error;             // Error code
        } DosError;
        ULONG Status;                 // 32-bit error code
    } Status;
    UCHAR Flags;                      // Flags
    USHORT Flags2;                    // More flags
    union {
        USHORT Pad[6];                // Ensure section is 12 bytes long
        struct {
            USHORT PidHigh;           // High part of PID
            ULONG  Unused;            // Not used
            ULONG  Unused2;
    } Extra;
    };
    USHORT Tid;                       // Tree identifier
    USHORT Pid;                       // Caller's process id
    USHORT Uid;                       // Unauthenticated user id
    USHORT Mid;                       // multiplex id
    UCHAR  WordCount;                 // Count of parameter words
    USHORT ParameterWords[ WordCount ];    // The parameter words
    USHORT ByteCount;                 // Count of bytes
    UCHAR  Buffer[ ByteCount ];       // The bytes


The "Protocol" field contains the name of the protocol (SMB) with a 
0xFF before.

The "Command" field contains the value of the requested command. For 
example 0x72 is for the "negotiate protocol" command.
 
The "Tid" field is used when the client is successfully connected to a
ressource on a SMB server . The TID number identifies this ressource.

The "Pid" field is used when the client has successfully created a 
process on the server. The PID number identifies this process.

The "Uid" field is used when a user is successfully authenticated 
on a server. The UID number identify this user.

The "Mid" field is used in couple with the PID when a client has 
several requests on the server ( process, threads, file acess...).

The "Flags2" field is also important, when the bit 15 is armed, the 
strings are UNICODE strings .  



----[ 6.4 - Description of the most importants SMB commands


 SMB negotiate Protocol (negprot)
 
   The Negotiate Protocol Command is used in the first step of the SMB 
session establishment.

The Command code for the field "Command" in the SMB Base header is : 0x72.

Here is the description of the negprot request and reply headers : 

  Request header
    
 UCHAR WordCount;              Count of parameter words = 0
 USHORT ByteCount;             Count of data bytes
 struct {
   UCHAR BufferFormat;        0x02 -- Dialect
   UCHAR DialectName[];       ASCII null-terminated string
 } Dialects[];

   This packet is sent by the client to give the server its list of 
SMB protocol versions supported.

   Just three things to say, for this packets, "WordCount" field is 
always set to zero, "ByteCount" field is equal to the size of the 
"Dialects" structure, the field "BufferFormat of "Dialects" is always
equal to 0x02.

   The "DialectName" string contains the name of the several SMB 
protocol versions supported by the client.    
 
  Reply header
    
 UCHAR WordCount;           Count of parameter words = 17
 USHORT DialectIndex;       Index of selected dialect
 UCHAR SecurityMode;        Security mode:
                            bit 0: 0 = share, 1 = user
                            bit 1: 1 = encrypt passwords
 USHORT MaxMpxCount;        Max pending multiplexed requests
 USHORT MaxNumberVcs;       Max VCs between client and server
 ULONG MaxBufferSize;       Max transmit buffer size
 ULONG MaxRawSize;          Maximum raw buffer size
 ULONG SessionKey;          Unique token identifying this session
 ULONG Capabilities;        Server capabilities
 ULONG SystemTimeLow;       System (UTC) time of the server (low).
 ULONG SystemTimeHigh;      System (UTC) time of the server (high).
 USHORT ServerTimeZone;     Time zone of server (min from UTC)
 UCHAR EncryptionKeyLength; Length of encryption key.
 USHORT ByteCount;          Count of data bytes
 UCHAR EncryptionKey[];     The challenge encryption key
 UCHAR OemDomainName[];     The name of the domain (in OEM chars)


This packet is sent by the server to give the client the list 
of SMB protocol versions supported, the SMB domain name of the server 
and an encryption key if necessary. 
 
IMPORTANT  :
 
The first interessant field is the "SecurityMode" byte. If the bit 0 
is armed we have a user security level. If it's not, we have a 
share security level. If the bit 1 is armed the password is encrypted
with a DES encryption in block mode.

The "SessionKey" field is used to identify the session . There is one 
single session key for one session.
 
The "Capabilities" field indicates if the server supported UNICODE 
strings or NT LM 0.12 particular commands ...
 
The datas are at the end of the header. With a negprot reply, 
these datas corespond to the strings "EncryptionKey" and 
"OemDomainName".

The length of these two strings together is given by the "Bytecount" 
field.
 
The length of the "EncrytionKey" string is given by the field 
"EncryptionKeyLength". The "EncryptionKey" string contains the Key for
the encryption of the password.

The length of "OemDomainName" is given by 
     (Bytecount - EncryptionKeyLength). 
The "OemDomainName" string contains the SMB domain name of the server
(in OEM chars).


 Session setup and X
  
   The Session Setup and X packets (SesssetupX or setupx for 
abbrevation) are used to deal with the identity of a user or when you
have to give a password to acess a ressource. 

   The Command code for the Session Setup and X command is 0x73.

  Request header
  
 UCHAR WordCount;               Count of parameter words = 13
 UCHAR AndXCommand;             Secondary (X) command;  0xFF = none
 UCHAR AndXReserved;            Reserved (must be 0)
 USHORT AndXOffset;             Offset to next command WordCount
 USHORT MaxBufferSize;          Client's maximum buffer size
 USHORT MaxMpxCount;            Actual maximum multiplexed pending
                                requests
 USHORT VcNumber;               0 = first (only), nonzero=additional
                                VC number
 ULONG SessionKey;              Session key (valid iff VcNumber != 0)
 USHORT                         Account password size, ANSI
 CaseInsensitivePasswordLength;
 USHORT                         Account password size, Unicode
 CaseSensitivePasswordLength;
 ULONG Reserved;                must be 0
 ULONG Capabilities;            Client capabilities
 USHORT ByteCount;              Count of data bytes;    min = 0
 UCHAR                          Account Password, ANSI
 CaseInsensitivePassword[];
 UCHAR CaseSensitivePassword[]; Account Password, Unicode
 STRING AccountName[];          Account Name, Unicode
 STRING PrimaryDomain[];        Client's primary domain, Unicode
 STRING NativeOS[];             Client's native operating system,
                                Unicode
 STRING NativeLanMan[];         Client's native LAN Manager type,
                                Unicode

This packet gives a lot of information about the client's system.

The field "MaxBufferSize" is very important, it gives the maximun 
size of data that the client can receive. If you set it to zero 
you will not receive any type of data from the server.
 
For the data, you have several strings. The most important are 
"CaseSensitivePassword" (password in UNICODE characters)
and "CaseInsensitivePassword" (password in ANSI characters).

One of both is used, it depends if the server is supporting UNICODE
strings or not (see negatiate protocol reply packet description). 
The length of the password is given in the fields 
"CaseInsensitivePasswordLength" or in
"CaseSensitivePasswordLength" .

For the other strings, see the description. The count of data bytes
is given by the "Bytecount" field.

 
  Reply header
  
 UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 3
 UCHAR AndXCommand;                 Secondary (X) command;  0xFF =
                                    none
 UCHAR AndXReserved;                Reserved (must be 0)
 USHORT AndXOffset;                 Offset to next command WordCount
 USHORT Action;                     Request mode:
                                    bit0 = logged in as GUEST
 USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes
 STRING NativeOS[];                 Server's native operating system
 STRING NativeLanMan[];             Server's native LAN Manager type
 STRING PrimaryDomain[];            Server's primary domain

Again, there are a lot of information on this packet : OS Type,
version of the SMB server software running on server and DomainName.

If the connection failed, there is nothing for NativeOS, NativeLanman
and PrimaryDomain strings.

OK I have finished with the "hard" part, we can play a little with 
the SMB protocol.

If you want to learn more about it, read [1].


----[ 6.5 - How I can recover SMB passwords in clear from the network 
            when they should be encrypted 


   During the session establishment, the password is sent to the server
during the SMB setupx Session. The SMB negprot reply packet contains 
a bit in the "SecurityMode" field which allows password encryption 
or not.

   So if you want to have a password in clear when all is encrypted, you
have two possibilities.

   The first one is to catch the encryption key and the encrypted 
password and brute force it ! It can be very long ...

	Some programs like LophtCrack (with SMBGrinder), dsniff or readsmb2 
sniff SMB encrypted passwords.

   The second way is to hijack the connection and to make the client 
believe that the password should not be encrypted.

   This technic is a bit complex to explain, but I will say how to 
do it !

   If the server is configured to encrypt password, the SMB negprot 
reply packet has the bit 1 of the "SecurityMode" field armed. But if 
an attacker sends a negprot reply packet with this bit equal to 
zero before the server, the password will be in clear in the 
SessetupX request packet .


                   negprot request 
  [client]     ------------------------>         [server]

                [attacker waits for a negprot request]

  [client]   <-------------|                     [server]
                           | fake negprot reply
                           |
                [attacker sends his fake neprot reply]


                  real negprot reply
  [client]   <----------------------------------  [server]


                [attacker (does nothing)]


               sessetupX request with the password in clear text
  [client]    ----------------------------------> [server]

                [attacker sniffs the password in clear text]


These diagrams illustrate a direct packet injection on the network.
In majority of case, this method doesn't work because the fake
negprot reply could treated after the real. There is also other 
problems, session failures, validity of password, does not work
in a switched environment...
We can avoid all of these problems by using Arp-Poisoning.

I will not explain and describe what is ARP-Poisoning, you could find a 
lot of docs about it on internet . But, if you don't know what it is, 
you just have to know that this attack allow the attacker to redirect 
and modify the traffic between the server and the client.

If you consider this situation, the attacker is between the both.

He is the man in the middle ...


----[ 6.6 - Man in the middle attack


          "Attack where your enemy is not expecting you"
                  
                                 Sun Tzu, "The art of war"

Now I will describe the man in the middle attack. This attack allow 
you to bypass switches, to avoid connection failures and to grab the 
password in clear.

Let's consider that the traffic between the client and the server 
is redirected by the attacker ( thanks to ARP poisoning !).
The client requests a SMB session to the server. 
The client will send packets to the SMB port (139) of the server. The 
attacker receives them. But the attacker doesn't redirect the packet to
the server. 
The whole incoming traffic to the server's SMB port (so to the attacker's 
machine) is redirected on the local port 1139 of the attacker (very easy 
to do with NAT and iptables).
The whole traffic (not only SMB) is redirected also with iptables and 
NAT. 
On the port 1139, there is a program (a transparent proxy program) that 
assumes the modification and redirection of the SMB packets.


The two iptables/NAT commands are :

To redirect the incoming traffic (on port 139 ) to a local port (1139 for
example).

#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -s 192.168.1.3 \
--dport 139 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1139

192.168.1.3 is the IP address of the client 

To redirect the whole traffic

#iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

What are the modifications ? :

The attacker modifies the negprot reply to have password in
clear text. The attacker recovers also the encryption key.
The attacker set to zero the value of the length of the encryption 
key and put the domain name instead of the encryption key. 
He sets the encryption bit of the "SecurityMode" field to 0. 
With this, the password will not be encrypted.

The client will send the password in clear in a sesssetupx request. 
When the attacker has the password, he encrypts it with the encryption
key recovered before and sends the sesssetupx request (with 
the encrypted password) to the server.

The server sends a sesssetupx reply to accept or refuse the session.
The attacker redirects the sesssetupx reply and the whole traffic 
after.

The session will not fail and nobody has saw our man in the middle !.

The server replies with a negprot reply with the encryption 
bit set to have the password encrypted. The attacker doesn't
redirects this packet. He changes the encryption bit to have
plain text password .

The attacker continues to redirect traffic between the two machines 
until the end of the SMB session.


The implementation of the man in the middle attack is given in the
Appendix A (the NAT and iptables rules are given also).

Take a look at the source code, you will learn a lot of
details !.


----[ 6.7 - Notes about windows 2k/XP SMB operating over TCP/IP 

As I wrote before, on Windows 2k/XP, SMB can run directly over TCP.
The SMB server is listening incoming connexions on port 445.
But it's not so "directly". In fact instead of having a NETBIOS header
which is 4 bytes long, we have a other header which is 4 bytes long too.

Description :

        |---------------|
        |      TCP      |
        |---------------|
        |SPECIAL HEADER |
        |---------------|
        |  SMB BASE HDR |
        |---------------|

This special header is defined like this :

                UCHAR Zero;   	// Set to zero
                UCHAR Length[3];// Count of data bytes (the 4 bytes of
                                   the header are not included)

This special header is not very different than the NETBIOS header. You 
will understand why.

This is the NETBIOS header :

                UCHAR Type;   	// Type of the packet
                UCHAR Flags;  	// Flags
                USHORT Length;	// Count of data bytes (netbios header
                                                        not included)
							
When SMB is running over TCP, the NETBIOS request session should 
be not used.

In fact, the NETBIOS names of the client and of the server should not 
be sent. So the value of the "Type" field in the NETBIOS is always 
equal to zero (the "Type" field is different from zero when the client
sends his encoded NETBIOS name - Type = 0x81 - and when it receives 
the reply - Type = 0x82 -). Remember, during the SMB session the
Type field is equal to zero ( it's the "Type" code for the NETBIOS 
session message).

For the first byte nothing is different.

For the last three bytes now :

The "Flags" field of the NETBIOS header is always set to zero.
The length of the packet only takes the two last bytes of the special
header.

The three last bytes are the same.

To conclude there is no difference between the NETBIOS and the special
header when NETBIOS is not used.

Downgrade attack :

If the client (running on windows XP or 2k) has NBT enabled, it always
try to connect to the port 139 and 445 simultaneously. If the client 
has a response from the port 445, the client will send a RST packet 
to the port 139. If the client has no response from the port 445, it 
will try to connect on port 139. If it has no response from the both, 
the session will fail.
If the client has NBT disabled, the client will try on the port 445 
only.

To perform a Downgrade attack i.e force the client to not use the port 
445 and to use the port 139, you have to make believe to the client 
that the 445 is closed. With the transparent proxy attack it's very 
easy, with iptables you have just to redirect the incoming traffic
on the attacker's machine on port 445 to a closed port. With this
the client will use the port 139 (the iptables rules for this is
given in appendix A).
This will work if NBT is enabled.

If the client has NBT disabled, the transparent proxy will operate the 
SMB traffic on port 445. You've got an option on the program for this.

Ok, we have finished with the attack for recovering passwords.
We will study now an another important part of SMB.

                  
--[ 7 - Transaction subprotocol and RAP commands


I will explain in this chapter a panel of special (and obscur ) 
SMB commands : the RAP commands.
These commands use the transaction subprotocol. 
I will also describe this subprotocol.

----[ 7.1 - The transaction subprotocol

When a large amount of data is sent during a SMB session or if there is
a specific operation requested,the SMB protocol includes a transaction 
subprotocol.  

The transaction subprotocol is mainly used for SMB Remote Procedure 
Calls : The RAP commands (RAP for Remote Administration Protocol). 
But I will explain it later. 

The transaction subprotocol is not a derived protocol of SMB. The 
transaction subprotocol is just an other command for SMB. So the
transaction subprotocol is layered on SMB base header and the command 
code for the transaction subprotocol is 0x25.

Like the other commands there is a request and a reply.

This is the Transaction request header :
				  
 UCHAR WordCount;                 Count of parameter words;   value =
                                  (14 + value of the "SetupCount" field)
 USHORT TotalParameterCount;      Total parameter bytes being sent
 USHORT TotalDataCount;           Total data bytes being sent
 USHORT MaxParameterCount;        Max parameter bytes to return
 USHORT MaxDataCount;             Max data bytes to return
 UCHAR MaxSetupCount;             Max setup words to return
 UCHAR Reserved;
 USHORT Flags;                    Additional information:
                                  bit 0 - also disconnect TID in TID
                                  bit 1 - one-way transaction (no
                                  response)
 ULONG Timeout;
 USHORT Reserved2;
 USHORT ParameterCount;           Parameter bytes sent this buffer
 USHORT ParameterOffset;          Offset (from header start) to
                                  Parameters
 USHORT DataCount;                Data bytes sent this buffer
 USHORT DataOffset;               Offset (from header start) to data
 UCHAR SetupCount;                Count of setup words
 UCHAR Reserved3;                 Reserved (pad above to word)
 USHORT Setup[SetupCount];        Setup words (# = SetupWordCount)
 USHORT ByteCount;                Count of data bytes
 STRING Name[];                   Name of transaction (NULL if
                                  SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2)
 UCHAR Pad[];                     Pad to SHORT or LONG
 UCHAR Parameters[                Parameter bytes (# = ParameterCount)
 ParameterCount];
 UCHAR Pad1[];                    Pad to SHORT or LONG
 UCHAR Data[ DataCount ];         Data bytes (# = DataCount)

In a majority of case, a RAP command sent with  Transaction subprotocol 
may need several Transaction packets for sending the parameters 
and data bytes. The parameters bytes are usually sent first, followed 
by the data bytes. If several transaction packets must be involved, 
the server sends this small packet for acknoledgement between each 
transaction packets :

Interim Reply packets :

 UCHAR WordCount;                 Count of parameter words = 0
 USHORT ByteCount;                Count of data bytes = 0

For the transaction request header, the "TotalParameterCount" field 
represents a count of paramaters bytes to be sent and it's the same 
for the "TotalDataCount" field (count of data bytes to be sent). 
 
The offset from the start of the SMB base header to the parameters 
bytes and the data bytes are given with the "ParameterOffset" and 
"DataOffset" fields. 

The parameters bytes are in the "Parameters" field.
The data bytes are in the "Data" field.

You must understand that these "Parameters" and "Data" fields are used 
for the RAP command. "Parameters" contains the parameters bytes for 
the RAP command and "Data", the data bytes.

The fields for "DataCount" and "ParameterCount" represent respectivily 
the count of data bytes and the count of parameters bytes present in 
the considereted transaction packet. If these fields are equal to 
the "TotalParameterCount" and the "TotalDataCount", it involved that 
all parameter and data bytes fit in a single packet. If they are not, 
it involved that the server (for request) or the client (for reply) 
must wait for another packets. When all packets are received, the 
parameter and data bytes are marshalled for analysis.

Take a look at the field "WordCount", it contains the value  : 
14 + "SetupCount" field, in majority of case SetupCount is equal to 0.

The Transaction reply header: 

There is not a big difference between the reply and the request

 UCHAR WordCount;                 Count of data bytes; value = 10 +
                                  "Setupcount" field.
 USHORT TotalParameterCount;      Total parameter bytes being sent
 USHORT TotalDataCount;           Total data bytes being sent
 USHORT Reserved;
 USHORT ParameterCount;           Parameter bytes sent this buffer
 USHORT ParameterOffset;          Offset (from header start) to
                                  Parameters
 USHORT ParameterDisplacement;    Displacement of these Parameter
                                  bytes
 USHORT DataCount;                Data bytes sent this buffer
 USHORT DataOffset;               Offset (from header start) to data
 USHORT DataDisplacement;         Displacement of these data bytes
 UCHAR SetupCount;                Count of setup words
 UCHAR Reserved2;                 Reserved (pad above to word)
 USHORT Setup[SetupWordCount];    Setup words (# = SetupWordCount)
 USHORT ByteCount;                Count of data bytes
 UCHAR Pad[];                     Pad to SHORT or LONG
 UCHAR                            Parameter bytes (# = ParameterCount)
 Parameters[ParameterCount];
 UCHAR Pad1[];                    Pad to SHORT or LONG
 UCHAR Data[DataCount];           Data bytes (# = DataCount)

The client must use the "ParameterOffset" and "DataOffset" to know the 
offset (from the beginning of the SMB base header) of data and 
parameters bytes.


----[ 7.2 - RAP commands     

RAP (Remote Administration Protocol) is the SMB implementation of 
RPC.   

 
RAP request : 

       |---------------------------|
       |TCP HDR                    |

       |---------------------------|
       
RAP Reply :

       |TCP HDR                    |
       |---------------------------|
       |NETBIOS HDR                |

       |---------------------------|
       |RAP REPLY DATAS            |
       |---------------------------| 	

        
 When you use a RAP command you always find the string "\PIPE\LANMAN" 
 in the "Name" field in the transaction (request and reply) header.
 
 These are several examples of RAP commands : 
 
 -NETSHAREENUM : Retrieve information about each shared ressource 
                 on a server

 -NETSERVERENUM2 : List all the computer of specified types in a 
                   specified domain

 -NETSERVERGETINFO : Get information about a specified server

 -NETSHAREGETINFO : Retrieve information about a paticular shared 
                    ressource

 -NETWKSTAUSERLOGON : Execute on a SMB server for logging an user.
 
 -NETWSTAUSERLOGOFF : The same but for deloging.

 -NETUSERGETINFO : Obtain information about a particular user.

 -NETWKSTAGETINFO : Obtain information about a particular station.

 -SAMOEMCHANGEPASSWORD : For changing the password of a specified user on 
                         a remote SMB server.

I'm not going to describe all of these commands, I will just take one for 
example (to have a listing of shared resource avaible on a server).

If you want to know more about RAP commands read [2].


--[ 8 - Using RAP commands to list available shares on a server

 
 This part is a complement of the previous chapter. I will explain 
how the RAP commands work by giving an example.


The program given in Appendix B is the implementation of what is 
explained in this chapter. It does the same things that the commands 
"net view \\ServerIP" (for DOS) or "smbclient -L ServerIP -N " 
(on Linux).  But this program allows you to specified the NETBIOS 
name, it is a bit anonymous. If you read this source you will 
learn a lot a things about SMB network programming.
 
How I can retrieve SMB everyone shares on a network :

The process is easy to understand. The client must be authentificated 
on the server . The client identifies itself with the process developed 
in chapter 3 (with no password). When the server has checked the 
identity of the client, the client sends a Tconx request (after the 
Sessetupx reply).

Tconx means "Tree CONnect and X).

The TconX request packet is used to acess to a shared ressource.

----[ 8.1 - Tconx Packets 
 

 Request header
  
 The TconX packets are layered on the SMB Base Header ("Command" = 0x75).

 
UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 4
UCHAR AndXCommand;                 Secondary (X) command; 0xFF = none
UCHAR AndXReserved;                Reserved (must be 0)
USHORT AndXOffset;                 Offset to next command WordCount
USHORT Flags;                      Additional information
                                   
USHORT PasswordLength;             Length of Password[]
USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes;    min = 3
UCHAR Password[];                  Password
STRING Path[];                     Server name and share name
STRING Service[];                  Service name



The password was sent during the session establishement. 
The Password length is set to 1 and and the Password 
string contains null value (0x00).

The string "Path" contains the name of the ressource that client wishes 
connect. It use the unicode style syntax . For example I want to connect 
 on a share called "myshare" on a server called "myserver" . The 
Path string will containt "\\myserver\myshare". 

The "Service" string contains the type of ressource requested :
       	
	string		Type of ressource
	
	"A:" 		disk share.
	"LPT1:" 	printer.
	"IPC"  	        named pipe.
	"COMM" 	        communications device.
	"?????" 	any type of device.
 
For scaning any type of device you must use the "?????" string in the 
"Service" field.

After sending your Tconx request on the server. The server replies with 
a TconX reply. You must recover the "Tid" field (in the SMB Base header) 
which is the Transaction request with the RAP command. 
You must specified to the server that you want to know which ressources 
are available. For this, you must use the RAP command : NETSHAREENUM.


----[ 8.2 - Explanation of the RAP command "NetShareEnum" :


The RAP command that we will study is NetShareEnum.

The RAP Command "NetshareEnum" request  :

The field "Parameters" of the transaction request header received :

  The 16 bit code of function NetShareEnum : 0;
  
  The parameter desriptor string : "WrLeh" 
  
  Data descriptor string for returned data : "B13BWZ"
  
  A 16 bit integer with a value of x01;
  
  A 16 bit integer that contains the size of the receive buffer.

It will be too long to explain how parameter and data descriptor strings 
works. These strings are used to know the size and the format of 
parameters and datas. One parameter and one data descriptor string 
is defined for each RAP command.

if you want to know more about this strings, read [2].

No datas are needed for this request so the "DataCount" and 
"TotalDataCount" fields are equal to zero. 


  |--------------------------------------------|

  D : 0x01 (defined value) and 0xffff (Max size of the received buffer) 
  
And the server replies :

the "Parameters" field of the transaction reply header receives :

 A 16 bit integer word that contains the return status code :

 Succes 0
 Access Denied 5
 Network Acess Denied 65
 More data 234
 Server not started 2114
 Transaction configuration bad 2141

 A 16 bit "converted word", uses to calculate an offset to remark 
strings.
 
 A 16 bit containts the number of entries returned = number of 
 SHARE_INFO structure (see below ).
 
 A 16 bit representing the number of available entries.
 
 
 The field "Data" of the transaction reply header contains the several
SHARE_INFO structures.
 
 The SHARE_INFO structure contains the information about each shared
ressource available and it is defined like this :
 
  struct SHARE_INFO {
    char shi1_netname[13]; /*Name of the ressource*/
    
    char shi1_pad; /*Pad to a word*/
                     
		     
    unsigned short shi1_type; 

       /*Code specifies the type of the shared resssource :
          0 Disk Directory tree
          1 Printer queue 
          2 Communications device 
          3 IPC*/


    char *shi1_remark; /*Remark on the specified 
                         ressource*/

		      }

 shi1_remark is a 32 bits pointer to a string. This string contains a
 remark about a shared ressource. You must substract the 16 lower 
 bits of "shi1_remark" to the "converter word" to know the offset 
 between this string and the beginning of the RAP reply parameters 
 header.

--[ 11 - Thanks

Just a Merry Christmas to TearDrop, Frealek and "el Tonio".

A big thank to TearDrop for all. Without him, nothing could
be possible !

Take a look at <gps.sourceforge.net>, you will find a very good 
(and free) scanner !.

Thanks to Mr D. (my network administrator !), for all the advices
and the several Linux distribs.

Thanks to the Chemical brothers for the inspirational music.

Thanks to the phrack staff, for all their remarks and particulary 
about the transparent proxy attack.

To you for reading this article ;).



--[  Appendix A

This program allows you to have password in clear directly from
the network when they should be encrypted. It works with libnet 
(v 1.1 !) and libpcap.
This is the implementation of the Transparent proxy attack of the
chapter 6.6.

libnet : www.packetfactory.net

libpcap : www.tcpdump.org

You must be root to compile and to execute this program !

If you want to compile it, you could use : 
       "gcc SMBproxy.c -o SMBproxy -lnet -lpcap"

If you want to use it :
       "SMBproxy -i interface  
                  -c Client's IP address 
		  -s Server's IP address 
		  -f your fake IP (what you want : 6.6.6.6 for example)"
                  -l listening port (1139 by default)

Be careful the program will ask you about Windows 2k/XP specifictions
support. But you must answer "y" when NBT is disabled not when it's 
enabled on Windows 2k/XP !

You give the IP adress of a client and of the server, this program 
waits a connection of the client to a SMBserver, launches the attack, 
recovers the password and redirects the traffic.

The fake IP parameter corresponds to your fake IP, give what you want !
The attacker's machine should have no active connections with the server 
or with the client (like FTP or telnet ...).
The default listening port is 1139

This program gives the password and the user name (if necessary). It 
also gives the security level (share or user). If the connection has 
succeeded, it gives the name of the share and a message like "password 
valid". If it has failed, it gives nothing (just the password and the
user name).

This program should be compiled on Linux for some technical reasons,
like the network byte ordering. You shouldn't use it on the loopback
interface.

Support Windows 2k/XP specifications.

This is the iptables/NAT command to execute on the attacker's machine

To redirect incoming traffic to port 139 on port 1139

#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -s 192.168.1.3 \
--dport 139 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1139

192.168.1.3 is the IP address of the client. 


To redirect the whole traffic

#iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

To redirect incoming traffic to port 445 on port 1139

(for Windows 2k/XP client with NBT disabled)

#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -s 192.168.1.3 \
--dport 445 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1139

192.168.1.3 is the IP address of the client. 


if you want to perform the downgrade attack of the chapter 6.8 remplace
the port 1139 by a closed port.

Be careful, for the traffic redirection, this line must be present in the
/etc/sysconfig/network :

FORWARD_IPV4=true

This program doesn't support UNICODE strings.

Successfully tested with samba server 2.0 .
