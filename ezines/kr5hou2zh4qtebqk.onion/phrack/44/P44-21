    All of us I am sure have read penultimate files on the workings of
Tymnet or in some cases Sprintnet. These are staples in a hacker's diet.
In fact any second rate "underground" BBS has complete sections on BT
North America and the nets available therein. However one such net you
will most likely see very little on, is Datapac.

    Datapac was originated in the late seventies by Telecom Canada, a
large partnership of Telcos and businesses interested in high speed data
transfers between Business & Government systems which would be hassle free
and cheaper in the long run. (The birth of most PSN's really.)

    The significance of Datapac however is that it has changed very little
by way of security in the past ten years, although it has extended
access to most of the globe in one fashion or another. Datapac is not
only a hacker's utopia due to lax (in some cases non-existant) security;
it is also, for the most part, safe ground (this term is, of course, used
somewhat lightly) for beginners and the unsure to try their luck/skill
at the game of packet switched network hacking. The Datapac net is most
important to Canadian Hackers who have direct access to it, and
therefore (if you're lucky) direct access to the world.

A list of dial-up ports in Canada follows.

                       Connecting and Addressing

    Once connected you will need to type one or three periods and a
carriage return, this will produce a numerical format denoting your port
address and node,
                           XXXX XXXX
    PORT Address-----------^    ^
    NODE number-----------------^

    Once this is established the network simply sits and waits for you to
spit commands at it, in other words an address to whence you would like to
travel. Failing this, idle time will have you disconnected, the time
varies but averages around 1 or 2 minutes.

    The formatting of a Datapac address is really quite simple and is
most often 8 digits long (sometimes ten but we'll get to that later)
The first four (the prefix) specify the current location in Canada,
for instance large cities will have several, just as they will have
more than one prefix in the phone directories. The last four digits
are arbitrary, and correspond to the host number.

    An address with ten numbers as opposed to eight (ie: xxxx xxxx xx) is
utilizing a subaddress.  Quite often these machines will be independent
of a cluster of nodes and there only to fulfill one task. Also they
may simply be segregated machines for no apparent reason at all
(except to make scans a bitch :>). Quite often you will find that
subsystems work as a PAD or PAC allowing you re-enter the Dpac from
a host level, therefore allowing you to make use of the company's
inherent NUI and connect to other places on the Dpac that disallow
collect calls.


                 Connecting to Machines on the Dpac

    Datapac, like most networks, uses NUIs (Network User ID) which
keep accounting for all billed connections.  HOWEVER a great deal of
machines on the Dpac allow for collect calls from within the network.
Yet if you have a valid NUI you may connect to ANY machine hooked up
to the Dpac (except those which are part of a closed user group).
I have found that it is best to PAD hop and avoid the whole NUI
problem entirely.  The following a list of connection messages
and their explanations for inter-network calls.

MESSAGE                         EXPLANATION
-------                         -----------
Call connected to: XXXXXXXX     A virtual circuit has been established
                                between an originating DTE and a remote
                                (receiving) DTE.

Hunted                          The remote logical channel is part of
                                a hunt group.

Backed Up                       The call attempt to the remote DTE has failed.
                                The network has re-directed the call to
                                another predetermined DTE that has been
                                optioned as backup.

I                               The call has been placed to an international
                                address.

P                               Priority service.  Packet size: 128.

N                               Normal service.  Packet size: 128 or 256.

DNA                             Data Network Address of the originating DTE.

LCN                             Logical Channel Number of the recipient DTE.

NUI                             The call will be billed to the 6 to 8
                                character Network User Identifier.

CUG                             The recipient DTE is part of a closed user
                                group.

Reverse Charge                  The recipient DTE has accepted the charge
                                associated With the established call.

    These reactions apply to any calls made that are not "international"
I will list the connect reactions for international calls in the following
section.

 DATAPAC INTERNATIONAL ACCESS PROCEDURES
 ---------------------------------------

    Datapac International provides outgoing and incoming access to 6 U.S.
based Networks and to over 100 packet-switched networks around the world.
To successfully complete such calls, Datapac has implemented the International
CCITT X.75 procedures and X.121 International numbering plan.  Thus, the
Datapac user originating an international call must use the following format:

                                           (1) (DNIC) (FOREIGN ADDRESS)
                                            :     :          :
      One defines the Datapac International.:     :          :
      Prefix.                                     :          :
                                                  :          :
      Packet networks are identified by a ........:          :
      four digit number called a DNIC                        :
      (data network identification code)                     :
                                                             :
      The foreign national address is .......................:
      expressed as an eight to ten digit
      address.

Here is a list of useful DNIC's if you get the urge to scan "other" networks.

    Sprintnet         3110
    Bell South        3143
    Centel            3148
    BT Tymnet         3106
    Accunet           3134
    NYNEX             3144
    U.S. West         3147
    ADP Autonet       3126
    Fedex             3138
    Express           3139

    If you are scanning (which I assume you might be) you will encounter a
great many cryptic messages.  So many, in fact, I am sure you will loose
count.  Some are worth mentioning some are not but here a few you might
encounter.

   CALL CLEARED --     A network problem within Datapac
   TEMPORARY NETWORK   or a foreign network prevents either
   PROBLEM (XXY)       the requested call from being established
                       or the established call from being

  CALL CLEARED --     Either the foreign network requested is not
  ADDRESS NOT IN      accessible from Datapac, or the foreign
  SERVICE (XXY)       network address specified identifies a
                      non-existent destination, i.e., the address is
                      not yet assigned or no longer assigned.
                      Verify with destination that the foreign
                      network is accessible from Datapac and that
                      the foreign network address is assigned.

 CALL CLEARED --      The calling terminal is not permitted to
 ACCESS BARRED        establish an international call to the
 (XXY)                called destination address because of a
                      closed user group violation.  Verify
                      network address with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     Either the foreign network or the
  COLLECT CALL        destination address is not willing to
  REFUSED (XXY)       accept the collect calls.  Verify the call
                      establishment procedures with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     The Call Request is considered invalid
  INCOMPATIBLE        by the foreign network mainly because of
  CALL OPTIONS        the incorrect number of digits in the
  (XXY)               foreign network address.  Verify foreign
                      network address with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     The destination is out of order, possibly
  DESTINATION NOT     because the destination's network access
  RESPONDING (XXY)    link is inoperative.  Try again later
                      and verify with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     The destination address called is fully
  DESTINATION BUSY    engaged (no logical channels available)
  (XXY)               and cannot accept another call at this
                      time.  Try again later.

  CALL CLEARED --     This message indicates a protocol error at
  REMOTE PROCEDURE    the remote DTE interface.  Check with remote
  ERROR (XXY)         DTE  (destination).


                      Outdials on Dpac

    On most Dpac dialups there are also dialouts, however to use them you
must either be calling from a Host on the Dpac or have a public access
NUI.  The latter tends to be more difficult to get than the former.  A list of
addresses for dialouts is available at 9210 0086 (the Datapac help
center), however it is OLD and therefore somewhat inaccurate so I have
not included it.  Also you will find that a majority of the dialouts
are of the low baud rate variety, however there are a few 19.2
dialouts as well.

    While dialouts are quite often a pain in the ass to access, all hope is
not lost.  Many of the machines you encounter on Dpac are LATservers,
Gandalfs, System/370s, etc. with dialouts.  I have found more
than a few that are COMPLETELY un-passworded with Global access
dialouts.

    Beyond all this, Dpac can also be very useful for covering your
tracks while attempting to perform digital voyeurism on other networks
like Sprintnet, Tymnet, etc.  It may mean that you have less leeway but it
still makes the target site go through a bit more difficulty in tracking
you down.

    In closing this, I am leaving a scan through which you can get familiar
with Dpac.  It is far from complete as a guide to Datapac, but lists
many of the systems I have found that accept collect calls.
I will first list prefixes and the areas they represent.

    If you are looking a decent Datapac Scanner you can get one at
403-283-5519, while this is not a public system, it will allow guest
users to log on and transfer a scanner made for Procomm for Windows
