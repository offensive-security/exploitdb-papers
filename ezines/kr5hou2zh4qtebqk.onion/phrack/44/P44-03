PHRACK TRIVIA

Last issue I tried something different.  I tried to have a little
trivia contest, giving away some prizes for the first to get all
the answers.  Well, I should have known that Phrack's readers
are lazy.  The amount of you who actually responded was pathetic.

The winners are:  dFx, Holistic, Damiano & Matt

I had planned on 5 winners.  Notice how many won.  I won't even
say how many these guys got right, because noone came close to
100%.  Obviously I'm the only trivia buff in the underground.

[Something very humorous I found on the FireWalls List]

A one-act play

Dramatis Personae:
 Perry Metzger (PM): an AVP responsible for the firewall at a
                            Fortune 100 company.
        Joe Cert (JC): A person at CERT supposed to be helping.

[The scene opens to Perry on the phone with Joe Cert. Perry is at work
and freaking out because he doesn't run Sun sendmail and doesn't know
what to do. If he turns off mail, his users will kill him. He has no
idea how many machines he has to fix or if he has a problem at all.]

PM: Well, I have the problem that I don't normally run Sun sendmail,
and I can't run it, so I need to know enough that I can figure out how
to fix my security problem.

JC: Well, we don't have a procedure to tell people anything beyond
what we put in the advisory.

PM: I run the gateway for a firm that trades hundreds of billions of
dollars a day in the financial markets. We can't afford do get shut
down. Isn't there any way you can tell me anything that can help me?

JC: Well, we really don't have a procedure in place.

PM: I see. Can I ask you some questions?

JC: Sure.

PM: So this problem, would it be fixed if I had the Prog mailer turned
off on my machines?

JC: Well, its a problem that will allow people to run programs on your
machine.

PM: Yes, but would turning off the Prog mailer fix it?

JC: Well, the problem allows people to run programs on your machine.

PM: I see. Will this problem only hurt machines that have direct TCP
access to the internet, or are machines that can get mail indirectly
also possibly affected?

JC: The hole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: Yes, but do you need SMTP access to the machine, or will just
being able to send mail to it hurt you?

JC: Well, the hole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: look, the machine on my firewall can't be telneted to. Does that
make me safe?

JC: Well, the hole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: Listen, I have THREE THOUSAND workstations in a dozen cities on
three continents. Are you telling me that I have to tell all my people
that they are working the weekend installing a new sendmail on every
machine in the firm? I don't even know how to test to see if I've
fixed the problem once I've done that!

JC: Well, the whole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: Can't you tell me any details?

JC: We really don't have a procedure for that.

PM: Do you know what the problem is?

JC: I can reproduce it, yes.

PM: Look, I work for a company with REAL MONEY on the line here. I can
get you a letter from a managing director telling you that I'm legit.
You can check who we are in any newspaper -- we're one of the largest
investment banks in the world. Every day the Wall Street Journal lists
the Lehman Brothers T-Bond Index on page C-1. You can check my
criminal record -- hell, the SEC makes you get fingerprinted so many
times around here that I've still got ink on my fingers from the last
time. Can't you give me some help here?

JC: We really don't have a procedure for doing that. I'm taking
notes, though, and I'll tell my management of your concerns.

[He continues in this vein, but eventually, our hero gives up,
realizing that CERT is part of the problem, not the solution. All
they've succeeded in doing is keeping him up at night. He can't fix
his problem, since he doesn't know how. He has no idea if he has a
problem. He can't check once he's done something to determine if he's
fixed it. All he knows is that CERT has no procedure for telling him
anything regardless of who he is, period.]

PM: So what you are telling me is that if I want details I have to
subscribe to 2600 Magazine?

JC: We don't have a procedure for giving you more information, no.

PM: I'm sure the crackers will be happy to hear that. They are likely
telling each other at a nice high speed.

The Sendmail bug is a bug that works using sendmail.

This bug works on hosts using sendmail and can allow
people to do things from remote through sendmail.

I know the bug, but I'm not going to give it out.

                               October 23, 1993
                         Hacker/Cracker Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has learned of several vulnerabilities
in the language used on the USENET system.  This vulnerability affects
all users running rn, tin or other USENET news readers as well as users
holding discussions containing the words "hacker" or "cracker".

Patches can be obtained from your local phrack archive as well as through
anonymous FTP to they ftp.netsys.com (192.215.1.2) system.

Information concerning specific patches is outlined below. Please note
that phrack sometimes updates patch files.  If you find that the checksum
is different, please contact phrack.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Hack and Crack Vulnerabilities

     These vulnerabilities affect all systems running a USENET news-
     reader including rn and tin, as well as all conversations, papers
     and stories involving the words "Cracker" and/or "Hacker".

     ** This vulnerability is being actively exploited and we strongly
        recommend that sites take immediate and corrective action. **

     A. Description

        A vulnerability exists in the words "Hacker" and "Cracker" such
        that users may become confused as to exactly who/what you are
        talking about when used in a sentence.

     B. Impact

        Unauthorized confusion to affected conversations may ensue.

     C. Solution

        We recommend that all affected sites take the following steps
        to secure their systems.

        1.  Obtain and install the appropriate patch following the
            instructions included with the patch.

          System       Patch ID   Filename         Checksum
          ------       --------   ---------------  ---------
           all          10288      10288.tar.Z      5551 212

        The checksums shown above are from the BSD-based checksum.

        2.  If your conversation is found to have been compromised by
            the word "Hacker" or "Cracker", we recommend you flame
            all parties involved and immediately break up the discussion
            by talking about the "correct" meaning of the words.

        3.  Depending upon the sensitivity of the information contained
            in your conversation, you may wish to replace the existing
            conversation with one discussing (a) the NSA,  (b) the BATF
            (c) The Kennedy Assasination, (d) why shadowing password
            schemes are helpful or hurtful or (e) which file editor is
            actually the best.

Power to the People

 A little theory to get you started:

Watts=Current * Voltage

    A power meter consists of a voltage coil, a current coil, a small motor
to drive the dials, and little else.  Given the formula above, if we can
somehow cut down the voltage that the meter 'sees', then we can reduce the
number of watts that it measures.  If we cut our voltage in 1/2, our watts
also get cut in half.

    Fortunately, your meter doesn't read the voltage directly off of the
lines into your house.  Two small wires lead to the voltage coil within the
meter.  Simple modification to this circuit is all that is needed.  Inserting
a resistor in series with the voltage coil will cut the voltage that the
meter sees, and therefore that wattage that it reads.

    Meters read Kilowatts per hour, and you pay so much for each kilowatt.
Since the hours remain constant (unless your stuck in one of those nasty
little dimensional time warps..and I really hate it when that happens), your
bill is directly related to what resistor value you insert.  Do this
correctly, and carefully, you will save a bundle on the power you use.

    Say I cut my bill by $40 per month..$40 * 12 months = $480 saved with
a original 'investment' of $5 that is a 96 fold return on your investment.
This idea also might be used to provide a service to your trusted friends,
$100 bux a mod or so..$$$

    One last little caution before you begin, don't go messing around with
the adjustment screws you will find, usually there are 2 of them with F & S
marked near them.  I had the foolish idea to mess with these, the result is
when I am drawing very little power (a few watts) my meter will slowly run
backwards.  Next time I'm modifying it, I'll have to fix that.  Mr. Meter
Reader would really wonder what the heck was going on when he saw that.
(Mr. Meter Reader will be thinking he's done far to many drugs on the
weekend..or needs to be.)

SUPPLIES NEEDED:

    (2) Power meters.  You'll perform the mod on one, and use the other to
        have in while you're doing it.
    (1) Length of heat shrink tubing, a sufficient size to cover a half
        watt resistor.
    (Some) half-watt resistors, 10k-25k or so.  (A 10K resistor will cut
           your bill in half...15K quit a bit more (the amount saved, is
           NOT linear to the resistor value..more like a logarithmic scale)
 (some) Good old 100% silicon caulk
    Soldering iron, solder, lots of nerve.

To begin the Mod:

    Take the little 'lock' they use (little plastic deal), and chuck it.  Wait
about 2 months for the reader to get used to the fact it's gone..the idea
is that if they think you've tampered with it cause the lock is gone..they
will check and find no tampering then..(least that's the idea)

    If you happen to know someone who works for the power company, and can
get your hands on some of those locks, get a few new ones, and let them 'age'
outside for a few months (to get that used look), then replace yours with it
when done.  And if anyone happens to know of a source for these locks, I
would appreciate knowing.

    You'll need to 'find/get/steal/snag/etc' another meter to put in while your
fixing your..(kinda hard to see/solder with no power) ;)

    Lift the now unlocked cover and pull meter out..(simply pulls out of the
socket real easy) put other meter in for a while..(do at night would be a good
idea..neighbors would wonder what the heck you were doing eh?)

    On the side of the meter, there will be a little (probably copper), pin,
that is designed to break when you unbend the end of it..(security device).
Be real careful and try not to break it when you bend it back (if it breaks,
save the piece that broke off)

    Pull that out, and then turn the ring that holds the unit together..it
should then come apart real easy.

    Between the assembly where the wheel is and the base plate, look in the gap,
there should be a black deal that looks like a transformer attached to the core
of the meter and 2 black wires leading from the prongs of the meter base to
the smaller coil.  This is the voltage coil.  Here comes the fun part!

    Cut one of the wires, being sure you cut where you can hide the damage
later.  Solder in 10k or 15k resistor with the leads of resistor cut off right
at resistor body, and also put the heat shrink tubing on the resistor, and
shrink it..(with heat preferably) ;)

    Take silicone rubber (the 100% pure stuff..) and glue the resistor and the
shrunk tubing over it underneath the top assembly.  Make it appear that the
wires simply curve up that way and nothing more.  Put ring back on.  Notice
that you must put the meter together exactly the way it came apart.
Example:  on mine, i noticed that there was dirt on the bottom from rain
splashing mud onto the meter.  It would look kinda obvious if the mud
suddenly appeared on top of the meter.

    Take the little pin that you removed (copper thing) and replace it in
the hole and through the ring as before. Bend the end back up like before
also if it broke, bend what is left anyways, there should be plenty left
to bend.  Take the broken end (if it broke), and jam it under the end of
the bend to make it look legit.  If they do pull the meter to inspect,
they will hopefully just think that it might have broke loose when it was
installed.

    I have noticed on some unmodified meters that I 'found' that the security
pin has been broken already.  So It's reasonable safe to assume that they
don't take much faith in them.

    When done, you should NOT be able to tell if any mods have been done by
looking.  Be sure it's undetectable, they get kinda mad when you do things
like this for some odd reason.  It's suggested that after the modification,
you have a friend, who you trust not to fink, take a very close look to
see if they can spot any mods.

    Your bill should drop in half or more..if you really want to drop the
bill..do this in steps.. a few months apart..so they won't notice that your
bill is dropping like a rock.  Just don't get silly.  Using only 1kwh per
month just yells fraud.  Mine went from $80-$90 a month to around $30-$37
month with a 10K resistor (I added a electric dryer and other items during
that month also.)

    You might want to try this a few times on other meters you've 'found'
just to get the nack of it first, it should work with all meters.  At least
the ones they use in my area.

Table of comparisons:

test made using 1320 watt electric heater.
120V
11 amps
1.3 KWH

resistor value              rev per time        voltage cross resistor rev/hour
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0                           1 rev/23 seconds     0                     156
1k                          1 rev/24 seconds     9.                    150
10K                         1 rev/42 seconds    63                      85
12k                         1 rev/53 seconds                            68
39K                         1 rev/464 seconds   ???                      7.25



    Notice the 39K resistor's performance, NOT a good choice to use, it
will cut your bill to 4% of the original.  They will wonder about this.
I'm currently using 10K which will cut it to approx 54% of the original bill.
My bill is around 1/2 previous. Saving me approx $30-$50 a month in power
bills.  Not bad for a 10 cent resistor.

    Keep in mine the wattage rating of the resistor.  Measure the voltage
across the resistor.  Take that number divide it by the resistor your using
to get current.  Take the current times current (square it), and multiply
this by resistance value to get the wattage of resistor that is required.
After all, it would not be a good thing for the resistor to go up in smoke.
Mr. Meter Reader would wonder why you used 0 kwh this month.

    There also is another method that in theory will make your power bill less,
this is called 'power factor correction', but unfortunately requires the use
of some rather large (read expensive) AC cap's.  For this reason (and the fact
it cost under $5 and provides more of a benefit), the method of using the
resistor is more useful and do-able by the everyone (especially those
who despise the 'system').


Notice that I have NOT left a email address or the like for correspondence,
namely due to the fact that this is highly illegal and greatly frowned upon
by the authorities.  If anyone has a need to contact me they may do so via
phrack magazine, they can forward mail to me.  If you do this modification
correctly and per instructions, you will indeed save money.  Have fun,
be careful, and challenge the system at every turn.

  DATA BANK OF THE GERMAN SPEAKING AN-ARCHISM
      The Da.d.A. Project
         DAtenbank des Deutschsprachigen Anarchismus

Berlin, Koln

    The history of the liberative movement has not yet been filed sufficiently.
That is, mainly, due to the lack of scientists with interest in exploring this
area.  Thanks to that, people who need bibliographic information for some
specific themes of the history of anarchism, must go through all direct sources
and derive from those some conclusions.  Things are more difficult in case
modern literature is required, for the theory and practice of liberative
movements, which have appeared in the meantime.

    The data bank of the German speaking anarchism (DAtenbank des
Deutschsprachigen Anarchismus) is trying to cover the lack of bibliographic
material.  Currently it files anarchistic or, generally, liberative documents
and publishes.  Later it will comprehend documents which deal with the history
and theory of those movements.

    We are focusing our compilation activities, to the German speaking areas
with plans of enhancing that shortly.  In parallel we are elaborating
an introduction to the publishing history of the printed material, which will
be informative for their political and editorial meanings.

    From the early 1980's, the filing of the German liberative press is open
for exploration.  It covers the chronological period from the philosophic
commencements of the German anarchism, in the 1832, until nowadays.  Strength
of expression is given to newspapers and magazines, though collections of
documents, almanacs, year-books, congresses' protocols and catalogs are
not omitted.

    Except of the anarchistic publishes we are also registering material whose
cooperatives or publishers were anarchists.  The filing is achieved using all
the usual bibliographical criterion (titles, publishers, date/district,
circulation, place of distribution et cetera).

    In order to handle the increasing demands of the people who would like to
access our material, we decided to publish our first synthetic registers in a
series of brochures.  This publication, in restricted copies and four or five
continuations, will be available at the "File of Social and Civilization
History" of the 'Libertad' publications in Berlin.  The first brochure, is
occupied with the German liberative press from 1832 to 1890.  Every copy of
this serial includes a diagram of the press' history, chronological
bibliography of the magazines and an index.

    We resume special researches through the data bank and we offer the results
printed.  Until now we have filed over 1000 titles, which offer many different
elements for research each.

    Da.d.A. is a private, research project.  We do not accept donations from
state institutions and other similar organizations.  In that way we can
continue our efforts undistracted and independent.  The disadvantage is
that we support Da.d.A. with personal expenses and when we have free time
available.

    The modern liberative press is difficult to register and get filed.
Although liberative publications were developed in an unprecedented way
(and not only arithmetically) after 1968, few publications are accessible
from libraries and files.  Especially today we must tune up our practises
in order to protect modern press.  We encourage every publisher of anarchistic
material, even if productions are ceased nowadays, to send us information and,
if possible, a copy of their publications.  They will get registered in our
computer and filed in the library for the Research of Social Demands, in
order to be accessible for studies in the future.

using the data bank, you can contact us in the following addresses:
