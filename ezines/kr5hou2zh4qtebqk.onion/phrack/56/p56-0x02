editor, except where noted.  The actual letters are perhaps edited for format,
but generally not for grammar and/or spelling.  We try not to correct the

Hackesses...
by MiStReSS DiVA

My name is MiStReSS DiVA...and I am a hackess...

    [ Who said what now?  A hackess?  Is that some sort of delicious pastry
      treat? ]

"Girls can't hack...,"  I've heard this more times than not

    [ Hrm.  I usually hear "girls cant do such-and-such az good az guyz" or
      "women shouldn't vote", or the ever popular "YOU WANT ANOTHER BLACK
      EYE?  NO?  GOOD!  GET BACK IN THERE AND MAKE ME A PIE." ]

at hackers conventions and the like.  Well, I have some news for everyone;

    [ They're bringing back Perfect Strangers? ]

There are women hackers, and our numbers are rising.

    [ Oh.  Damn.  I really miss Balki. ]

Let's think about it for a moment-Women have always taken second seat to
men, especially in the computer industry and business.

    [ There'z a reason for this...  No..  Hrm.  There really isn't. ]

Over 75% of jobs in computer industries and taken by men.

    [ How do you think we feel?  Over 75% of the jobs in the baking and sewing
      industries are taken by women! ]

So, it's no surprise that there aren't many women in hacking.  There's the
issue of some hacking activities being illegal.

    [ Don't discount the major issue that hacking activities have nothing to
      do with makeup, shopping at strip mallz or gold digging! ]

Many women want to stay as far away from situations like that as possible.  I
know many girls who don't even drink or smoke illegally, no less break into a
UNIX server, let alone know what one is.

    [ I bet these are the same chickz who turn me down when I ask them out.
      Course, all chickz turn me down when I ask them out so I guess it'z a
      moot point. :( ]

Then again, maybe we don't hear about them because there ways are much more
cleaver than that of a man.

    [ Ok, I'm calling a no-way on this sentence here.  As in "no-way are you
      *this* retarded". ]

Women, and I'm applying this to myself as well, are naturally more sneaky
and watchful.

    [ If by sneaky and watchful you mean conniving and vindictive then I
      agree with you. ]

I know for a fact that women have hacked into sites and to systems,

    [ Ah yes.  Thiz bringz me back.  I remember one little minx who hacked her
      way right into my heart.  Did me up real good too, she did. ]

but why do we still get no credit in the underground community?

    [ End this suffrage of innocent hackess' now! ]

Is it because we hid ourselves behind handles

    [ Maybe it iz becuase you have love handlez? ]

and tags,

    [ Nametagz?  Like at Walgreenz? ]

or because people don't want to actually give us the credit.

    [ Well, personally, after reading this, I wouldn't give you a shred of
      credit either. ]

I have only heard of three cases where females were caught in a hack.

    [ Shit.  3?  I can remember the great `chickhack `96` when 423 girlz were
      all caught hacking.  I think their major flaw was that they all tried
      to break into bebe.com at the same time. :( ]

One girl got caught because while sending a file, she sent it to the wrong
location on a server.

    [ What like C:\windows\desktop? ]

One was caught for phreaking, and the other one for obtaining products from an
internet site by gaining root access and shipping them to her home, free of
charge.  These are the only three cases I have found.  And they were all
stupid reasons to get caught.  I know there are many people out there who hack
and don't get caught, but the majority that do get caught, are men.  We don't
do stuff like the chick from hackers, nor do we dress or act in that manner.

    [ Well, I think we've identified your problem.  Angelina Jolie pretty much
      sumz up whut everyone wantz to see in a hackess.  Mmmm.  Delicious
      hackess treats. ]

We go about our lives like most human beings, maybe even a little better.

    [ Or in your case, a little dumber. ]

We don't dress in all black, nor are we interested in only computers.  We are
intelligent and beautiful.  We are the Hackesses.

    [ Mmmmmm.  Hostess Hackesses. ]

Hi, my name is Adam and am regular guy with a home pc who is being hacked and
violated by a military freak..

    [ Military freak like Klinger on M.A.S.H. or military freak like that guy
      in Commando who wore the chain mail shirt? ]

seriously no shit. 

    [ Oh.  Ok.  I though you were pulling my leg for second.  Sorry...  Back
      on the clock now. ]

i dont know where to start to ensure my pc security

    [ Well if you didn't have a PC you wouldn't have this problem.  I say
      get rid of it.  The end justifies the means. ]

please reccomend some high level security methods and programs.

    [ Have you tried ignoring it?  That sometimes works for me.  Barring that,
      have you tried dealing with him?  I find that freaks (especially military
      freaks) are usually pretty cordial when you deal with them on their
      terms.  I say give in to his demands. ]

if you cant do that then please reccommend any links i have found your site
usefull because you provide elite items therefore i require your help please.

    [ The highest level of security I can think of is God.  I recommend you
      pray each night, and I'll forward this to him.  Together we *can* make
      a difference. ]

    [ HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.  Wait.  I don't get it. ]

P.S. I don't have a computer either, I'm sending this via DSS and I'm typing
on the Remote Control.

    [ What do you mean, `either`?  Wait, is this Adam from above?  Hey man,
      did you do what I recommended?  Did it work?  The forward to God bounced
      so I wasn't sure if anything happened.  Good for you man! ]

Hi, Let me explain what I need for the job I do. I have what we call mystery
diners which visit my restaurant each month, this is done by a firm called
MARITZ in Berkshire, what I would like is the dates when they visit my
restaurant so I can make myself available for the visit day, is this possible
in any way.

Does the author of article 52-9 have a degree in literature?

    [ Definitely not.  However, I think he has a degree in money management.
      Well, maybe not.  But he's SO very good with money.  Maybe he just likes
      it alot.  Maybe it's something ingrained into his personality or
      culture... ]

If so, I think we made some sashimi together.

Helu,

First off, much thanks to the Phrack staff for producing a wonderful
publication.. regardless of _WHEN_ they come out.  I have found them very
informative since the current group tookover the whole process.

    [ Group?  Paha.  I wish I had a staff.  It'z just me and my mom dude.
      She doez the writing and I do the copy and editz. ]

I read the article on "Building Bastion Routers Using Cisco IOS",

    [ (p55-10). ]

which was a decent piece and contained a lot of basic IOS information that
would apply to building a bastion router.

There was a part of a section however that I felt should've been covered a
little more accurately,

    [ WELL PREACH ON BROTHER!@ ]

which was in the section entitled "Step 2 : Limit remote access".  The article
mentions that there have been rumors that SSH would make it into Cisco IOS
12.0, however it never made it in.  Now, I'm not certain when the actual
article was written so it may just be that the article has old information.
Nonetheless, there is SSH support included in Cisco IOS 12.05(S) and it works
like a charm.   A few things worth noting about Cisco IOS 12.05(S):

--   It is the preferred and recommended IOS release for Internet backbone
     routers as well as for service providers ( i.e. perfect candidates for
     bastion routers ).

--   It runs on enterprise class routers.  Meaning the image runs on the
     following hardware:  7200, 7500, and 12000 (GSR) series routers.

--   It was released in July of 1999.


So there are a lot of people that aren't running their operation on enterprise
class routers, however a ton of NSPs and ISPs do; thus this information about
SSH is worthy of mentioning.

Anyways, keep up the excellent work.

    [ Thankz for your input! ]

Gentlemen,

I enjoy reading your issues when you get them out and all I have to say is
keep up the good work.

Dear Sultan of Love, et al.,

    [ Huh. ]

I wanted to give some of your readers help on some of the stuff they sent in.

One, get serious help.

    [ Ok thankz! ]

Two, check out the book "PIHKAL: Phenylalanines I Have Known and Loved."
I can't remember who it's by, but it's got everything you ever wanted to know
about psychotropics, psychodelics, and more... much, much more.  Read and
practice at your discretion.

    [ You suck.  You recommend a book _you_ can't remember with some
      goofy-ass title _I_ can't remember? ]

Three, I lived in Japan and had peanut butter sent to me, because peanut
butter made in Japan is awful.

    [ It didn't use to be.  Back in the 1920's and 1930's Japanese peanut
      butter was considered to be the best in world.  Mercenary ronin were
      often paid off with jars of the stuff.  This all changed after WWII.
      Recently declassified State Department documents bring light to the fact
      that several key strategic targets during WWII bombing raids were the
      Japanese peanut butter factories.   The documents list the reason for
      the strategic importance as "creamy goodness".  Pundits charge however
      that the U.S. just couldn't live with Japan having the peanut butter
      edge.  Either way, we bombed the Japanese peanut industry back into the
      stone age. ]

The guy who talked about smuggling drugs into Japan in peanut butter has
really fubar'd.  Some poor shmuck in Japanese customs is going to be opening
up my decent edible peanut butter.  For godsakes, guys, necessity may be the
mother of invention, but sometimes it's just a mother.

    [ LEAVE MY MOM OUT OF THIS, JERKOFF! ]

Leave well enough alone.

    [ Now why on earth should our drug-loving friends in Japan be held hostage
      by your desire to eat 'Jiffy' instead 'Mister Super Happy Fun Peanut
      Butter Joy'? ]

Lastly, I actually don't have a thing to say about computers.  I'm a med
student and know next to nothing about computers.  I just wanted to let you
know that you guys are so funny you put me in tears.  Do you really have a
hard time meeting chicks?!

    [ Not meeting them, no.  Just talking to them.  I tend to drool. ]

I don't believe it.

    [ Are you coming on to me? ]

Someone please tell our friend here that Cisco has already implemented

in Phrack55.  I enjoyed the last letter about the McDonalds article so I

School, and let me tell you that this article had me laughing so hard I was

didnt decrypt it. After that I was having problems with my software so I
formatted my hard drive.

    [ Geeze.  Way to go moron. ]

Now the problem is that I have lost my recovery floppy.

    [ Hhahahaha!  Holy shit that sucks! ]

Greetings,

just in case the folks who write to you asking for manuals for Darwin Award
Delivery Devices are not sufficiently intimidated by your usual "you will
die, I hope you understand" response, I thought I'd pass this info along:

at least Massachusetts, though probably many other states as well, has what it
calls an Infernal Device law.  This law defines an "infernal device" loosely
to cover things that will get idiots killed in their parents' basement, and
then bans it.  So it's not just the Grim Reaper who awaits people who try to
put lighter fluid in their supersoakers, but also The Man.

i think you should know that a well known hacker by the name of "the jolly
rodger" (the one with the cook book), is extracting philes from the archives
and putting them in his cook book with out giving the nessecery credit to the
writers.

    [ Does he include recipes for crayon sandwiches?  Coz that'z renz's
      personal recipe and he should definitely give due credit. ]

he may say that the philes were writen by him,but the fact that they
are written word for word, points to him as the cuprit.

My name is Thomas and am currently still in what you would call in America as
senior high.   I'm 15 years old and found this Phrack page while i was surfing
on the net.

    [ Well I see you've done your homework.  Nice work Thomas! ]

I've always wanted to become involved in the art of hacking and i really don't
know how to really start i've had my computer for about 2 and some years and
catch on to things preety well and was wondering where to go from here.

    [ Let'z plug that into the career calculator and see what she comes up
      with.....  Ok..  Yes..  Let'z see here...

        - 30.98% Help desk for regional fast food new hire processing office
        - 30.56% Junior copier repair engineer
        - 15.40% NO CAREER FOUND
        - 12.45% Phone support engineer for the outdoor furniture industry
        - 10.61% "Associate"

      Hrm.  Lookz bleak. ]

All i wanted to ask you if you can help me out by telling me how i can start
out,i don't intend to reach a master level even though it is an aspiration of
mine.

    [ Whoa Tommy.  Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither are superhackers.
      Start small, keep at it, and take your vitamins and say your prayers
      like a good little Hulkamaniac. ]

I'm currently using my brothers computer because it's a shit load faster
than mine and would appreciate it if you could write back and maybe give me
some good insight on how i can start out which probably would involve a lot of
reading and learning more about programing. 

    [ My first bit of advice is for you to *definitely* steal your brother's
      computer.  Survival of the fittest my boy!  And besides, one of the
      many traits of a superhacker is how fast he can run crackerjack on passwd
      files (and yes this implies you should be running DOS -- Unix is a fad).

      My second bit of advice is to read as much as possible.  Anything By
      the late W. Richard Stevens.  Check out http://www.securityfocus.com.
      Keep up to date with current eventz in the security world.  Try and make
      friends in the scene.

      My third bit of advice is to give up at the first sign of adversity or
      difficulty.  Life rewards cowards, Thomas.  Never forget that
      (persistence pays off in the long run but laziness pays off right
      away). ]

Hi Phrack Staff.

    [ Hi Emil. ]

Before I start pleading with you i'd just like to say that you have the best
E-Zine on the Internet.

    [ Thanks :). ]

I've followed your magazine for about 2 years now. But, as i searched your
archive i've noticed that now you have almost no sections on things that go
boom (Anarchy etc) anymore.

    [ Our explosives consultant left for a higher paying job :(. ]

I have a vast knowledge of that subject and how to perform things like
pyrotechnics safely.  I do not know much about encoding (public key lock, i
think?) and hacking. But as i said, i am ELITE in pyrotechnics.

    [ Performing pyrotechnics safely?  That's like getting drunk without loaded
      guns nearby or sex with your cousin..  It may seem like a fun idea, but
      at the end of the day it'z just kind of a letdown. ]

Soooo, please could I submit to Phrack on pyrotechnics and things that go boom.

    [ Like an 808 trigger on a bass drum? ]

I might need some help on encoding, if its really necessery. I am prepared to
give up time for Phrack and it would be great if i could submit.

    [ Hrm.  I don't think we have any openingz at the moment..  Tell you what
      you get me a resume, and I PROMISE to call you when something opens up. ]

an argument about something or other...next thing I know my pc crashes

fried....I can only assume the aformentiond person was the cause of
this...so how the hell did they do it???....is there anyway I can guard
against this kind of attack??..

I have this person who keeps pissing me off and going out of his/her

    [ Don't do it man!  Stand your ground...  The line must be drawn HERE! ]

line, but of course he could not, would not, tell me how.  I can't say as
I blame him.  However since you guys are into things like this

    [ I try to keep myself thoroughly insulated from America Online (not to
      be confused with AntiOnline -- they are a whole different kind of dumb).
      To do this I keep what I call "the three layers of AOL abstraction".
      That means I don't use America Online, my mom doesn't use America Online,
      and not even my grandma uses America Online.  I'm not 'into things like
      this'. ]

could you PLEASE tell me how I can go about doing such a thing...
should this person start up with me again.  I had to put up with bullies
in school.  I refuse to be pushed around in the cyber world.

    [ Pent-up passive-aggressive dork alert!  Whoop!  Whoop! ]

And NO i do not want to tell AOL...that would make me out to be a tattle
tell, and that I'm not.

    [ Whoop!  Whoop!  Boy, you're really lighting up this alarm here! ]

I would appreciate would make me out to be a tattle tell, and that I'm not.

at the risk of being flamed in your next issue i felt compelled to write.

    [ UH-OH! ]

reading your latest issue's loopback i noticed that several innocent inquiries
were being blasted by the editor.

    [ You noticed that eh?  How delightfully intuitive! ]

While reading these was funny,

    [ YES! ]

i felt a bit disheartened.

    [ DAMN. ]

Isn't it a major tenant of hacking to promote freedom of information?

    [ Christ.  I am so sick of people hiding behind the /tenet/ of "Information
      wants to be free, man!".  Mainly because 99% of the people who bleat this
      platitude like it'z going out of style really don't understand what
      they're saying.  I will say good day to you Fat Tony. ]

Responding to inquiries about "how do i hack?" with "piss off peon" or
whatever witty equivalent your publication provided,

    [ Geeze.  I like to think I'm a hair more clever than `piss off peon`... ]

i felt was in direct contrast to the hacker ethic.  how is the tradition ever
going to continue if no one is willing to nurture the hackers of the future?

    [ Nurture?  Shure.  Change diapers?  No. ]

is Phrack's message that accomplished hackers should horde their skills and
knowledge to the detriment of future hackers?  Maybe you should provide
newbies with avenues to learning instead of flaming them with "i'm cooler
than thou" messages.  perhaps part of the hacker communities bad image is
their aloofness, their secrecy, and their condescention.  Chew on that
Phrack.
