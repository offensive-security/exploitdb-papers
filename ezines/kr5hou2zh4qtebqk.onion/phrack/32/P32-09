Ok, ok... Just what you wanted... a file of RSTS!!! Hah...
Well.. One would be suprised on how many RSTS systems are still around
on variuos X.25 networks, not to mention they are soooo much fun!
Here is a little list of some various commands that is good to keep
lying around just to use as a reference of just for you nostaglic type
people like me.  So enjoy, and if you were never involved in hacking
when RSTS was popular, you really missed something.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ALLOCATE
The ALLOCATE command reserves a physical device for your use during
the current session and optionally establishes a logical name for
the device. Once a device has been allocated, other users cannot access
the device until you specifically deallocate it or log out.  You can
allocate a device only when it is not allocated by another job.

Format

ALLOCATE device-name[:] [logical-name[:]]

Prompts

Device: device-name

See also:  ASSIGN, DEALLOCATE

*APPEND
The APPEND command adds the contents of one or more files to the end
of the file you specify. APPEND is similar in syntax and function to
the COPY command.

Format

APPEND [node::]input-file-spec[,...]  [node::]output-file-spec

Command Qualifiers                  Defaults

   /[NO]LOG                         /LOG
   /[NO]QUERY                       /NOQUERY

Prompts

From: input-file-spec[,...]

To: output-file-spec

See also:  COPY

*ASSIGN
The ASSIGN command lets you relate a logical name to a directory
or to a physical device.  The names you ASSIGN stay in effect until
you log out, or log into another account or until you DEASSIGN the name.

Format

ASSIGN device-name:[[ppn]] logical-name[:]

Prompts

Device: device-name:[[ppn]]

Logical name: logical-name[:]

*BASIC
The BASIC command invokes the BASIC-PLUS or BASIC-PLUS-2 programming
environment, depending on the qualifiers you use and the system's
default. It also prepares RSTS/E for the development of BASIC programs.

Format

BASIC

Command Qualifiers                  Comments

   /BP2                             Invokes the BASIC-PLUS-2
                                    programming environment
   /BPLUS                           Invokes the BASIC-PLUS
                                    programming environment

All subsequent commands are interpreted as BASIC programming commands,
until you type the following command to return to the DCL keyboard
monitor:  DCL <ret>

*CCL
Format

CCL ccl-command

The Concise Command Language (CCL) allows you to enter a command name
rather than type RUN and a program name.

You can type CCL commands directly after DCL's dollar prompt ($).
The format of the CCL command is defined by your system manager.
For details about the use of a CCL command, refer to the
documentation written for your site.

When you are using the DCL Keyboard Monitor, DCL commands take
precedence over CCL commands.  If your system manager gives a CCL
command the same name as a DCL command, you must type the prefix
"CCL" a space, and the CCL command itself.

For example, a CCL command name "DIRECTORY" and the DCL command
"DIRECTORY" may produce different results depending on how the CCL
command works at your site.  To use the CCL version, type:
    $  CCL DIRECTORY <ret>

*COBOL
The COBOL command compiles a COBOL-81 program.  (Only one source file at a
time can be compiled with COBOL-81.)


Format:

COBOL file-spec

   /OBJECT[=objfile]              /OBJECT
   /NOOBJECT

Prompts

File:  file-spec

See also:  LINK

*COPY
The COPY command duplicates one or more existing files.
You can use COPY to:

- copy one file to another file
- merge (concatenate) more than one file into a single file
- copy a group of files to another group of files

Format

COPY [node::]input-file-spec[,...]  [node::]output-file-spec

Qualifiers                          Defaults

   /ALLOCATION=n
   /[NO]CONTIGUOUS       (N)
   /[NO]LOG              (N)        /LOG
   /[NO]OVERLAY                     /NOOVERLAY
   /PROTECTION=n
   /[NO]QUERY            (N)        /NOQUERY
   /[NO]REPLACE          (N)        /NOREPLACE

(N) denotes a qualifier that you can use in network operations.

Prompts

From: input-file-spec[,...]

To: output-file-spec

*CREATE
The CREATE command allows you to enter text and save it as a file.

Format

CREATE file-spec

Prompts

File: file-spec

Once you have entered the file-spec, press RETURN and you may start
typing text.  Press <CTRL/Z> when you have finished entering text.

Command Qualifiers

   /ALLOCATION=n
   /[NO]CONTIGUOUS
   /PROTECTION=n
   /[NO]REPLACE

See also:  EDIT

*DEALLOCATE
The DEALLOCATE command releases a device that you reserved for private
use, so that other users may have access to it. (However, DEALLOCATE
does not deassign any logical name you may have set up for the device.)

Format

DEALLOCATE device-name[:]

Command Qualifiers                  Defaults

   /ALL                             none

Prompts

Device: device-name[:]

See also:  ALLOCATE

*DEASSIGN
The DEASSIGN command cancels logical name assignments you made with
the ASSIGN or ALLOCATE commands.

Format

DEASSIGN [logical-name[:]]

Command Qualifiers                  Defaults

   /ALL

Prompts

Logical name: logical-name[:]

See also:  ASSIGN, DEALLOCATE

*DELETE/ENTRY
The DELETE/ENTRY command deletes jobs from the queue that have not
yet begun processing or jobs that are currently being processed.

Format

DELETE/ENTRY=job-number [queue-name[:]]

Command Qualifiers                  Defaults

   /BATCH

Prompts

Queue: queue-name[:]

If you do not specify a queue name, LP0: is assumed.

See also:  PRINT, SUBMIT, DELETE/JOB, SET QUEUE/ENTRY

*DELETE/JOB

The DELETE/JOB command uses the name of a job to cancel a request
to the print or batch queue.

Format

DELETE/JOB=job-name [queue-name[:]]

Command Qualifiers                  Defaults

   /BATCH

For example, if you decide after you make your print request that you
do not want a hard copy of the file after all, you can use the
DELETE/JOB command to withdraw your request.  (If the file is printed
before you enter the DELETE/JOB command, your request is too late.
However, it works if your file is in the middle of printing: the file
stops printing.)

See also:  PRINT, SUBMIT, DELETE/ENTRY, SET QUEUE/JOB

*DELETE
The DELETE command permanently removes a file from your account.

Format

DELETE [node::]file-spec[,...]

Command Qualifiers                 Defaults

   /BEFORE=date
   /CREATED                        /CREATED

The DIFFERENCES command compares two files and lists any sections
of text that differ between the two files.

Format

   /IGNORE=BLANKLINES
   /MATCH=size                      /MATCH=3
   /MAXIMUM_DIFFERENCES=n
   /OUTPUT[=file-spec]

Prompts:

File 1: input-file-spec

File 2: compare-file-spec

        [=USED]
   /NOSIZE
   /TOTAL


*DISMOUNT
Releases a disk or tape previously accessed with a MOUNT command.
You issue this command before you take the drive off line, or before
you physically dismount the tape or disk.

The DISMOUNT command deallocates the device if it was allocated to
you.  (On some systems, dismounting a disk requires privileges.)
You cannot DISMOUNT a device if there are open files on it.  If you
try, RSTS/E displays the message:

?Account or device in use

Format

DISMOUNT  device-name[:] [label]

the name you specify.  You can use this name to modify the status of
the job in the queue.

See also:  DELETE/JOB, SET QUEUE/ENTRY

jobs.

To temporarily halt the display of a file, use <CTRL/S>.  To resume
output where it was interrupted, use <CTRL/Q>. (On a VT100 terminal
you can also press the NO SCROLL key to stop and restart output.)

To suppress the display but continue command processing, use <CTRL/O>.
If you press <CTRL/O> again before processing is completed, output
resumes at the current point in command processing.

To stop command execution entirely, press <CTRL/C>.  The use of
<CTRL/C> returns you to DCL command level.
