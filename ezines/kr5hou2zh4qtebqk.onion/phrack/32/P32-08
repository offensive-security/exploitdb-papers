Overview
~~~~~~~
        In this file, I will explain what the System User Authorization File
is, what information it contains, what the logical and physical characteristics
of the file are, and how one can manipulate it to reveal and/or modify its
contents.

Background
~~~~~~~~
        The Virtual Memory System (VMS) Operating System's System User
Authorization File (SYSUAF) contains the information that determines a given
user's username, password(s), security priviledges, as well as many other
similar data which either allow or disallow the user to have the system
perform certain tasks.

Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The SYSUAF.DAT file (UAF) is usually located on the system on the
device pointed to by the logical SYS$COMMON, and under the [SYSEXE]
subdirectory.  However, if the logical SYSUAF exists, it will point to the
location and name of the UAF.

        The UAF is a binary, indexed data file.  It's indexed on 4 keys:
username, UIC, extended user identifier, and owner identifier.  Using
the VMS ANALYZE utility reveals the following about the UAF:

Examination
~~~~~~~~~

        Generally, an interactive user would use the AUTHORIZE utility to
modify or examine the UAF, while a program would use the $GETUAI system
services (get user authorization information service) to examine the file.
The $GETUAI system services reference provide an excellent description of what
fields the UAF contains, and how many bytes are used within the file to store
each of those fields.  However, it may not be within your realm of skills to
program using system services.  It would probably be considerably easier to
use a sector editor/browser to locate values within the UAF.  You could use a
sector editor/browser online (such as VFE.EXE), or you you might choose to
download the UAF and use an editor/browse for your personal computer.
Regardless of which method you choose, you will have to know the offset of
each field within the user authorization file.  This is what I have provided
for you.

        The contents of the UAF under VMS release 5.3-1 are as follows:

Offset   Description                                            Length
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0     Record Header                                             4
   4     Username (loginid)                                       32
  36     Member UIC - Mem UIC decimal   1 = 0100                   2
                      Mem UIC decimal  10 = 0A00
                      Mem UIC decimal 256 = FF01

  38     Group UIC  - Same as format as member UIC                 2

         Note:  UICs as displayed in the VMS environment
         are OCTAL.  A UIC of [010,001] would be saved as
         '01000800' in bytes 36-39 (offset).

        Dates and times are stored as 8 bytes representing the number of
seconds elapsed since November 17, 1858, 12:00:00 a.m.

        Earlier versions of the VMS UAF will contain much of the same data,
which should be at the same offset as listed above.


        Should you decide to attempt to modify the SYSUAF.DAT file, keep in
mind that if you download the file, when you upload it, it will not be the
same as it was before; it will not be an indexed file.  You *might* be able
to create an .FDL file (using ANALYZE/RMS/FDL SYSUAF.DAT), and use that .FDL
file to convert it back to an indexed file
(with CONVERT/FDL=SYSUAF.FDL UPLOAD_UAF.DAT NEW_UAF.DAT), but chances that it
will contain the proper indexing and file attributes are slim.  Remember when
altering the SYSUAF.DAT file to keep a copy around (on the system) in case
you need to repair the damage.
