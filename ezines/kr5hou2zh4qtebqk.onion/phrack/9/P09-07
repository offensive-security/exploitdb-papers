                    A Multi-User Chat Program for DEC-10s

Intro:  Unlike its more sophisticated older brother, the VAX, the DEC has no
easy-to-use communication system like the VMS PHONE utility.  The following
program makes use of the MIC file type available on most DECs.  Each user that
wishes to be involved in the conference needs to run the program from his area
using the .DO COM command.  The program can be entered with any editor (I
recommend SED if you have VT52 emulation), and should be saved as COM.MIC. The
program does not assume any specific terminal type or emulation.  You will
have to know the TTY number of any person you wish to add to the conference,
but this is available through a .SYSTAT command or .R WHO (see below.)

This is an example of a SYSTAT to used to determine TTY#...

        The TTY# is available in the TTY column... DET means that the user is
detached and is unavailable for chatting...

        In each case, I am on TTY# 64...

        Anyway, use the following program, it's more convenient that doing a
.SEN <tty> every time you want to send a message.   Also, to shut out an
annoying sender, use .SET TTY GAG.  To remove, .SET TTY NO GAG... pretty
simple, huh?

        Wasn't that neat?  A feature that you can implement separately to be a
pain in the ass is the recursive MIC that sends an annoying message to a
specified terminal.  It is almost impossible for them to shut you out without
logging out unless they are already gagged.
        Just create a small MIC file called BUG.MIC... to do it in two lines,
simply type...
 .SEN <tty # goes here> Eat hot photons, Vogon slime!
 .DO BUG

        That's it!  I hope this comes in useful to someone out there!  Give us
a call at The Shack... 512-396-1120  300/1200 baud, 24 hours a day... And a
special welcome to all the feds who will doubtlessly be calling since the
number appears in here... we have nothing to hide!
