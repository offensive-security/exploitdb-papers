     DIALOG  is  one  of the  largest  online  databases.  DIALOG
currently  provides  access  to over 250 databases  containing  a
total  of over  100  Million  records.  The  range of information
available is enormous.


BEGIN:
     The  BEGIN  command starts a search and tells  Dialog  which
database you want it to check out.  The BEGIN command is followed
(without  a  space) by the file number of the database you  want.
Either  of  the following ways could get you into  the  file  229
(Drug information):

     Begin229
     or
     B229

     Dialog will then put the date,  the time,  your user number,
and what it costs for  the  database you just left.  For example,
if you move from ERIC (file 1)  to Management  Contents (file 75)
it would look like this:

-------------------------------------------------------

File75:Management Contents - 74-86/Sep
(Corp. Management Contents Inc.)
          Set  Items     Description
          ___  _____     ___________

-------------------------------------------------------

EXPAND:
     The  EXPAND  command is used to pick keywords for a  search.
You  can search for any word;  but knowing how common a  word  is
gives you a good idea where to start your search.

     All databases have a index of searchable words.  You can see
if there are any words of the same spelling to a keyword you want
to search for. For example:

-------------------------------------------------------

? Expand Drink
Ref  Items     Index-term
E1       1     Drina
E2       1     Drinfeld
E3      31    *Drink
E4       2     Drinkers
 .       .        .
 .       .        .
 .       .        .
E12      3     Dripping

-------------------------------------------------------

     The  word  -more- at  the bottom of the  screen  means  that
typing Page or P will display another screen of information.

SELECT:
     When  you find the word you want to search for,  you use the
SELECT  command  to  tell the database what to  search  for.  The
SELECT command can be followed with one or more search terms.

SELECT STEP:
     The  SELECT STEP command works just like the SELECT command,
except the files it finds are listed separately.

-------------------------------------------------------

? SS television? OR tv
          1    21347     TELEVISION
          2    6376      TV
          3    22690     1 or 2
? SS s3 AND violen? AND child?
          4    1680      VIOLEN?
          5    20577     CHILD?
          6    38        3 AND 4 AND 5

-------------------------------------------------------

TYPE and DISPLAY:
     There are two commands, TYPE and DISPLAY, that you  can  use
to look over the information you have found.   The  difference is
the TYPE command causes a non-stop list of  the information.  The
DISPLAY lets the information to list a page at a time,  you  have
to type PAGE or P to see the next page.

     DIALOG offers nine formats to display retrieved files.

     Format    Parts of Record Listed
     ~~~~~~    ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
     1         Accession Number
     2         Complete record except abstract
     3         Bibliographic citation
     4         File dependent
     5         Complete record
     6         Accession number and title
     7         Bibliographic citation and abstract
     8         Accession number, title, and indexing
     9         File dependent



LOGOFF:
     The   LOGOFF   command  has  no  abbreviation.   It's   self
explanatory.
