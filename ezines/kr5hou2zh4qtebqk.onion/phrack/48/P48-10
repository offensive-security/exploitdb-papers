              Electronic Telephone Cards: How to make your own!
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I guess that Sweden is not the only country that employs the electronic
phone card systems from Schlumberger Technologies. This article will
explain a bit about the cards they use, and how they work. In the end of
this article you will also find an UUEncoded file which contains source
code for a PIC16C84 micro-controller program that completely emulates a
Schlumberger Telephone card and of course printed circuit board layouts
+ a component list... But before we begin talking seriously of this
matter I must first make it completely clear that whatever you use this
information for, is entirely YOUR responsibility, and I cannot be held
liable for any problems that the use of this information can cause for
you or for anybody else. In other words: I give this away FOR FREE, and
I don't expect to get ANYTHING back in return!

The Original Telephone Card:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since I probably would have had a hard time writing a better article
than the one Stephane Bausson from France wrote a while ago, I will not
attempt to give a better explanation than that one; I will instead
incorporate it in this phile, but I do want to make it clear that the
following part about the cards technical specification was not written
by me: Merely the parts in quotes are things added by me... Instead I
will concentrate on explaining how to build your own telephone card
emulator and how the security measures in the payphone system created by
Schlumberger Technologies work, and how to trick it... But first, let's
have a look at the technical specifications of the various "smart memory
card" systems used for the payphones.

    I-1) Introduction:
	 ------------

       You must not think that the electronics phone-cards are
completely secret things, and that you can not read the information that
is inside. It is quite false, since in fact an electronic phonecard does
not contain any secret information like credit cards, and an electronic
phonecard is nothing else than a 256 bit EPROM with serial output.

       Besides do not think that you are going to refill them when you
understand how they work, since for that you should reset the 256 bits
of the cards by erasing the whole card. But the chip is coated in UV
opaqued resin even if sometimes you can see it as transparent! Even if
you were smart enough to erase the 256 bits of the card you should
program the manufacturer area, but this is quite impossible since these
first 96 bits are write protected by a lock-out fuse that is fused after
the card programming in factory.

       Nevertheless it can be very interesting to study how these cards
work, to see which kind of data are inside and how the data are mapped
inside or to see how many units are left inside for example. Besides
there are a great number of applications of these cards when there are
used (only for personal usage of course) , since you can use them as key
to open a door, or you can also use them as key to secure a program,
etc...

       These Telecards have been created in 1984 and at this time
constructors decided to build these cards in NMOS technology but now,
they plan to change by 1994 all readers in the public to booths and use
CMOS technology. Also they plan to use EEPROM to secure the cards and to
add many useful informations in, and you will perhaps use phone cards to
buy you bread or any thing else.

These cards are called Second Generation Telecards.

Reset:
------
  The address counter is reset to 0 when the clock line CLK is raised
while the control line R is high. Note that the address counter can not
be reset when it is in the range 0 to 7.

   The address counter is incremented by 1 with each rising edge of the
clock signal Clk, for as long as the control line R remains low. The
data held in each addressed bit is output to I/O contact each time Clk
falls. It is not impossible to decrement the address counter, therefore
to address an earlier bit, the address counter must be reset then
incremented to require value.


Write:
------
   All unwritten or erased bits in the address 64-104 may be unwritten
to. When a memory cell is unwritten to, it is set to 0. The addressed
cell is unwritten to by the following sequence.

1- R is raised while Clk is low, to disable address counter increment
for one clock pulse.

2- Clk is then raised for a minimum of 10ms to write to the address bit.

When to write operation ends, and Clk falls, the address counter is
unlocked, and the content of the written cell, which is now 0, is output
to I/O contact if the operation is correct.

The next Clk pulse will increment the address by one, then the write
sequence can be repeated to write the next bit.

WriteCarry:
-----------

   A counter is erased by performing the WRITECARRY sequence on the
stage of the next highest weighing to that to be erased.

The writecarry sequence is as follows:

1 - Set the address counter to an unwritten bit in the next highest
counter stage to that to be erased.

2 - Increment is disabled on the following rising edge of R where Clk
remains low.

3 - Clk is then raised for a minimum of 10ms, while R is low, to write
to the next address bit.

4 - R is the raised again while Clk remains low to disable increment a
second time.

5 - Clk is the raised for a minimum of 1ms, while R is low, to write to
the addressed bit a second time, erasing the counter level immediately
below that the addressed bit.

The Issuer area:
----------------

    This issuer consists of 40 bits. The contents of the issuer area are
specified by the card issuer, and are fixed during the manufacturing
process. The contents of the issuer area will include data such as
serial numbers, dates, and distribution centers.

This area may only be read.

The Counter area:
-----------------

   The counter area stores the card's units. Its initial value is
specified by the card issuer and set during manufacturing.

The counter area is divided into a 5 stage abacus.

Note that you can only decrease the counter and it is not authorized to
write in the counter a value greater than the old value.
