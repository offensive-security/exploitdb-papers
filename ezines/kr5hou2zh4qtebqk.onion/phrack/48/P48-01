Yes, it's the annual issue of Phrack you've all been waiting for,
hopefully you have kept your security clearances current.  The delay has
been a long one, much longer than anyone would have liked.  Obviously
Phrack was never meant to be put out so infrequently, but the
continual pressures of daily life have taken their toll on yet
another editor.  Yes, those little things like going to work, paying
the rent and all the other hassles that interfere with putting out a
large quarterly hobbbyist publication.

It finally came down to three choices:  keep the status quo and put out an
issue whenever, charge per issue, or get in some new blood.  Obviously the
status quo sucked, and an issue a year was just unacceptable.  Charging
everyone was even more unacceptable, even though "Information wants to
be $4.95."  So, that left bringing in more people to help.

The hard thing was finding people worth bringing into the fold.
There was never any shortage of people who wanted to take over the
whole magazine, but it wasn't until three of them banded together and
volunteered to take over the main editorial nightmare that it looked
like there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  Voyager, maintainer of
the #hack FAQ and editor of CoTNO, RedDragon editor of FeH and
continual discoverer of Linux root bugs, and Daemon9 admin of InfoNexus and
text file author extraordinaire, came forward en masse and said,
"We'll do it."

Most of you have no idea how hard it is to put out a magazine like Phrack
with any degree of regularity.  You have to track down articles, answer
tons of mail, read all kinds of news, edit the articles (most of which
were written with English as a second languge,) maintain the mailing
list, maintain the WWW site, etc.  Hopefully with all the new
people involved, the new division of labor will allow everyone to
contribute and put out a magazine in a very timely fashion.  (And allow poor
old Erikb to rest easy knowing the magazine is being taken care of so
he can devote more time to being a puppet-like stooge of The Man.)

In any case, you've waited long enough...here's Issue 48.
