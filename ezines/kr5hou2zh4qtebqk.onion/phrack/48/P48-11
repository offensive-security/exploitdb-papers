              Electronic Telephone Cards: How to make your own!

The Program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, when I saw this phile about the cards the first time, about a year
ago I quickly realized that this system is very unsecure and really
needs to be hacked. So, now I present you with a piece of software for
the PIC 16C84 RISC micro-controller from Microchip that will take care
of emulating the cards used by Schlumberger and others. This system is
to be found in Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway and Finland), Spain, France
and other countries. I do know that France probably needs some small
modifications for this to work, but I see no reason to as why it
shouldn't do so! For this to work, you need to have access to a PROM
burner which can handle the PIC 16C84, or you might just build one
yourself as I include some plans for that in the UUEncoded block to be
found at the end of this phile. First of all, you have to read off the
first 12 bytes of data from a valid card from the country you wish your
emulator to work in. This because I don't think it would be a good idea
to publish stolen card identities in Phrack. Then you simply enter those
12 bytes of data in the proper place in my program and compile it.
That's it... And since I happen to choose a version of the PIC with
internal Data EEPROM, that means that the first 12 locations of the Data
EEPROM should contain the card id bytes. As of today this code should
work smooth and fine, but maybe you'll need to modify it later on when
Schlumberger gets tired of my hack. But since the PIC is a very fast and
powerful micro-controller it might be quite hard for them to come up
with a solution to this problem. Let's have a look at the PIC Software!
(Note that the current version of Microchip's PICSTART 16B package is
unable to program the DATA EEPROM array in the 16C84 so if you are going
to use that one, use the other version of the source code which you'll
find in the UUEncoded part!).

The Security System:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The security of the Schlumberger card system depends strongly on two
things: the metal detector in the card reader which senses if there is
any metal on the card where there shouldn't be any metal. Circuit traces
on a home built card is definitively made of metal. So, we have to
figure out a way of getting around this problem... Well, that isn't
really too hard! They made one really big mistake: If the metal detector
is grounded, it doesn't work!! If you look at the printout of my layouts
for this card you'll find one big area of the board that is rectangle
shaped. In this area you should make a big blob of solder that is
between 2-3 millimeters high (approximately!). When the card slides into
the phone, the blob should be touching the metal detector and since the
blob is connected to ground the detector is also being grounded. The
phone also counts the number of times the metal detector gets triggered
by foreign objects in the card reader (Meaning that the phone companies
security staff can see if someone's attempting to use a fake card that
doesn't have this counter-measure on it!) and this is of course included
in the daily service report the phone sends to the central computer.

The second security lies in the cards first 12 bytes, it's not just what
it appears to be: a serial number, it's more than that. Part of the
first byte is a checksum of the number of 1's in the 11 bytes following
it. Then byte 2 is always $83, identifying the card as an electronic
phonecard. Byte 3 and 4 is the number of units on the card: The first
nibble of byte 3 is always $1 and then in the remaining three nibbles
the number of units is stored in BCD code, for example $11,$22 means 120
units (Two units is always fused at the factory as a test, see the text
by Stephane Bausson!) Then we have 4 bytes of card serial number data, 2
bytes of card checksum (calculated with a 16 bit key stored in the
payphone's ROM), 1 byte that is always $11, and then at last, byte 12
which is the country identifier.

The Parts Needed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	01 * PIC16C84, 4 MHz version, Surface Mounted (SOIC-18 Package)
	01 * 4 MHz Ceramic Resonator, Surface Mounted
	02 * 22 pF Capacitors, Surface Mounted (Size 1206).
	01 * 0.8mm thick single sided circuit board with P20 photoresist

The Construction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since this project is obviously not intended for the novice in
electronics I will not go into the basic details of soldering/etching
circuit boards. If you do not know much of this, ask a friend who does
for help. If you want to reach me for help, write to Phrack and ask them
to forward the letter to me as I wish to remain anonymous - This project
will probably upset a lot of phone companies and last but not least the
guys at Schlumberger Tech.

The UUEncoded Part:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this part of the phile you will find circuit board layouts for Tango
PCB as well as HP LaserJet binary files which will output the layout
when printed from DOS with the PRINT command.

You will also find another version of the source code to use if your PIC
programmer can't handle the programming of the 64 byte Data EEPROM
array.

<UUEncoded Part Begins Here>.
