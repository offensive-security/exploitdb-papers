                      Motorola Command Mode Information

                      Written and typed up by Cherokee
 


NOTE: The following text is only a few pages from an official Motorola
      handbook that I received, thanks to Ob1.
      
                        THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE HANDBOOK 
      
      but it is very useful as a guide to learning how to use the self
      test instructions on the Motorola series of cellular phones.

      To actually enter the self test modes, THERE ARE SEVERAL STAGES
      BEFORE HAND THAT NEED TO BE DONE.  They depend upon what type of
      Motorola mobile phone you possess.  To my knowledge, the self test
      mode instructions are the same on every Motorola phone, the only
      difference will be how you enter the test mode. That I leave up to
      you to find out as there are lots of help files already out there,
      unless, there is a great demand for it.

      I will now show you how easy it is to use the test mode to your
      advantage.

      Say, your the average peeping Tom or Sally (what hacker isn't?),
      this is how to listen in on other peoples mobile conversations.

      1.Enter the test mode.
      2.Turn the speaker on (08#) also called un-muting the receive audio. 
      3.Tune into a channel(11xxxx#) (where x can range from 0 to
      600[TACS] and 1329 to 2047[ETACS].)... Although I'm not 100% sure
      of the channel mapping, (theres conversations in the range between
      600 to 1329), you'd do best to stick to playing around with these.

      You may have to try several different channels, to pick up a
      conversation, not every channel is occupied with a user.  I
      suggest you try 0 to 50, this is almost guaranteed to give you a
      result. BTW, it is actually illegal to monitor mobile
      communications without the consent of both parties, but hey, whose
      going to know? :-)

      Displaying information - Some handsets only allow display 1 line,
      and therefore you wont be able to see all of the information being
      sent to you. There are 2 ways around this. 1. Is to go and get a
      handset which can display 2 lines of information. 2. to send the
      data to your computer to display on the screen, apparently the
      data is sent and received in an unfamiliar packet format, and will
      need to be decoded.

      FINAL NOTE: 
      There are several conflicting sources for some commands, this is
      because of different versions of the ROM, so I'm putting all of
      the test codes bundled together in this file, and will update the
      list if there are any significant changes, or I find out about a
      new command in a later ROM version.

      Just one last final note to say hi to Davex[thanks for the NAM
      guide], Ratscabies, Maelstrom, Hi.T.Moonweed and Ob1.

                     Motorola Self Test Mode Instructions
                     ------------------------------------


1. INTRODUCTION

Portable radio telephones are equipped for self-test, allowing service
personnel to control and monitor radiotelephone functions via the
telephone keypad.  The self-test mode operates at two levels:

1) a status display level, which allows the portable telephone to
operate normally while providing status indications in the display and;

2) the service level, which removes the portable telephone from normal
service and allows commands to be entered through the keypad to
'manually' control the operation of the radiotelephone.

2. OPERATING PROCEDURES

2.1 STATUS DISPLAY LEVEL OF SELF-TEST

This level of self-test is entered by momentarily shorting pin 6 of J2
to ground, while turning the radiotelephone on.  The self-test mode can
also be entered using the portable radiotelephone test kit (RTL4228A and
RTL4229A).

In this level of self-test mode the radiotelephone will place and
receive calls as normal except the radiotelephone displays status
information. The displayed status information alternates between the
channel number and RSSI status information, and the primary status
information (SAT frequency, carrier state, signaling tone state, power
level, voice/data channel mode, and Rx and Tx audio states).  The format
and explanation of this status information is given in Table 1 under 02#
Radio Status Request.

When dialing a phone number, the display of the status in formation
ceases when the first digit of the phone number is entered.  When the
Snd button (or End or Clr) is pressed, the status information display
resumes.

2.2 SERVICING LEVEL OF SELF-TEST

  |-----------------------------------------------------------
  |                             NOTE
  |-----------------------------------------------------------
  |     While in the servicing level mode of self-test, the
  |     display does not alternate.  Only the primary status
  |     information is displayed.
  |-----------------------------------------------------------

The servicing level allows the servicing personnel to take control of
the radio operation by entering the test commands through the telephone
keypad.  Such parameters as operating channel, output power level
muting, and data transmission can all be selected by entering the
corresponding commands.  The servicing level is entered from the status
display level by pressing the (#) button.  At this time the radio
telephones cease to function automatically in the radiotelephone system.
Table 1 shows the test commands and the corresponding results.

Table 1. Test Commands For Self-Test Mode

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| NOTES:
| 1. Each command consists of at least two digits entered from the telephone
|    keypad with the entry terminated using the (#) key.
| 2. If the command relates to a test function with multiple data displays,
|    the (#) key is used to pause at scanning data or to step through
|    sequential test functions.  Entering the (#) key during a pause time
|    resumes scanning.
| 3. For commands that initiate an action that requires a response or that 
|    accumulates error counts, the (#) key terminates the test.
