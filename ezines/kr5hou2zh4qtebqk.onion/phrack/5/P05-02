-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Broadway Hacker started out in the BBS world in late 1983 when he
first got his modem.  On March 23, 1985, The Broadway Show, his first bulletin
board, was launched into the BBS world.  It started on 1 disk drive at 300 baud
and has upgraded incredibly.  It was originally a phreak board as it currently
is also.  He had originally gotten his C-64 computer in early 1985.  Various
members of the elite world including King Blotto, Lex Luthor, and Dr. Who got
on his board to make it the memorable board that it was before the format
change.  His phreak experience began in 1981 through CB radios when a CB'er
gave him a code over the line.  Some of the memorable phreak boards he was on
included Blottoland, The AT&T Phone Center of 312, and Dark Side of the Moon of
818.  He gives credit for his phreak knowledge to conferences mostly.  The Radio

         Mike works at a very large radio station.  His phreaking is unknown at
work.  He's not particularly interested in programming beyond modifying The
Radio Station.

         Broadway Hacker hasn't the time for hacking now.  Broadway attends the
Tap meetings in New York occasionally, but in the past he was a regular.  He
attended the 1986 TelePub meeting in New York which was to decide the fate of
Tap magazine.  Broadway has met various phreaks in person including BIOC Agent
003, Lex Luthor, Dr. Who, King Blotto, Cheshire Catalyst, The Sprinter, The
Saint, Micro Ghoul, 2600 Magazine People, Paul Muad'Dib, and TUC.  There were
others, but he couldn't remember at 9:00 AM EST.  He has made it a point to not
become a member of groups, but he has been, in the past, invited to many.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Interests: Traveling, radio, telecommunications (modeming, phreaking),
                   trashing, meeting other phreaks, BBS'ing, and running The
                   Radio Station.

Broadway Hacker's Favorite Things

Some People to Mention
----------------------

Sigmund Fraud  (an up-and-coming phreak who has learned a lot in a short time)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Broadway Hacker wishes you all to know that he does not conference at
all any more because conferencing has depreciated from the old days and that
they have become mostly a place to gather for gossip.

I hope you enjoyed this phile, look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming in
the near future.  ...And now for the regularly taken poll from all interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  For the most part, Broadway says, "No".
Thanks for your time Mike.
