Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Welcome to the world of the 5ESS.  In this file I will be covering
the switch topology, hardware, software, and how to program the switch.  I
am sure this file will make a few people pissed off <grin> over at BellCORE.
   Anyways, the 5ESS switch is the best (I think) all around switch. Far
better then an NT. NT has spent too much time with SONET and their S/DMS
TransportNode OC48.  Not enough time with ISDN, like AT$T has done. Not only
that, but DMS 100s are slow, slow, slow! Though I must hand it to NT, their
DMS-1 is far better then AT$T's SLC-96.



What is the 5ESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The 5ESS is a switch. The first No. 5ESS in service was cut over in Seneca,
Illinois (815) in the early 1982.  This test ran into a few problem, but all
and all was a success.  The 5ESS is a digital switching system, this
advantage was realized in No. 4 ESS in 1976.  The 5ESS network is a TST
(Time Space Time) topology, the TSIs (Time Slot Interchangers) each
have their own processor, this makes the 5ESS one of the faster switches.
Though I hear some ATM switches are getting up there.

COMMON COMPONENTS OF THE SWITCH MODULE (SM)

    Switch Module Processor Unit (SMPU)

    - Contains microprocessors which perform many of the call processing
      functions for trunks and links terminated on the SM.

    Time Slot Interchange Unit (TSIU)

    - 512 time slot capacity
    - Connects to the TMS over two 256-time slot Network Control and Timing
      (NCT) links.
    - Switches time slots from Interface Units to one of the NCT links (for
      intermodule calls).
    - Switches time slots from one Interface Unit to another within the SM
      (for intramodule calls).

    Digital Service Unit (DSU)

    - Local DSU provides high usage service circuits, such as tone decoders
      and generators, for lines and trunks terminated on the SM.
    - Global DSU provides low usage service circuits, such as 3-port
      conference circuits and the Transmission Test Facility, for all lines
      and trunks in the office (requires 64 time slots).

    The SM may be equipped with four types of Interface Units:

    Line Unit (LU)

    - For terminating analog lines.
    - Contains a solid-state two-stage analog concentrator that provides
      access to 64 output channels. The concentrator can be fully equipped to
      provide 8:1 concentration or can be fully equipped to provide 6:1 or 4:1
      concentration.
    - Each TU requires 64 time slots.

    Trunk Unit (TU)

    - For terminating analog trunks.
    - Each TU requires 64 time slots.

    Digital Line Trunk Unit (DLTU)

    - For terminating digital trunks and RSM's.
    - Each fully equipped DLTU requires 256 time slots.
    - A maximum of 10 DSls maybe terminated on one DLTU.

   The SM may be equipped with any combination of LU's, TU's, DCLU's and DLTU's
totaling 512 time slots.


5ESS System Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The 5ESS is a UNIX based switch. UNIX has played a large part in
switching systems since 1973 when UNIX was use in the Switching Control Center
System (SCCS).  The first SCCS was a 16 bit microcomputer. The use of
UNIX for SCCS allowed development in C code, pseudo code, load test,
structure and thought. This led the development of the other switching systems
which AT$T produces today (such at System 75, 85, 1AESS AP, and 5ESS).
NOTE: You may hear SCCS called the "mini" sometimes
   The 5ESS's /etc/getty is not set up for the normal login that one would
expect to see on a UNIX System. This is due to the different channels that
the 5ESS has. The some channels are the TEST Channel, Maintenance Channel,
and RC Channel (which will be the point of focus). Once you are on one
channel you can not change the channel, as someone has said " it is
not a TV!" You are physically on the channel you are on.


Test Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The TEST channel is where one can test lines, and test the switch itself.
This is where operating support systems (such as LMOS) operate from.
This channel allows one to monitor lines via the number test trunk aka
adding a third trunk), voltage test and line seizure.
Here is a list of OSSs which access the test channels on the 5ESS.

SCC Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~

   The SCC channel is where the SCC looks and watches the switch 24 hours a day,
seven days a week! From this channel one can input RC messages if necessary.
A lot of people have scanned these out, and though they were AMATs.  Well this
is in short, WRONG! Here is a sample buffering of what they are finding.

  This has nothing to do with AMA, this is switch output on say the SCC
channel.  This is used by the SCCS for logging, and monitoring of alarms.
The whole point of this channel is to make sure the switch is doing what it
should do, and to log all activity on the switch. NOTHING MORE!
   To go into these messages and say what they are would take far too long,
order the OM manuals for the 5ESS, watch out, they are about 5 times the size of
the IM (input manual) set.  On average it takes someone three years of training
to be able to understand all this stuff, there is no way anyone can write a
little file in Phrack and hope all who read it understand everything about the
5ESS. RTFM!


RC Channel
~~~~~~~~~~

   The RC/V (Recent Change/Verify) Channel is where new features can be added or taken
away from phone lines. This is the main channel you may come in contact with,
if you come in contact with any at all. When one connects to a 5ESS RC/V channel
one may be dumped to a CRAFT
shell if the login has not been activated.  Access to the switch when the
login is active is controlled by lognames and passwords to restrict
unwanted entry to the system.  In addition, the SCC (Switching Control
Center) sets permission modes in the 5ESS switch which control the RC
(recent change) security function.
   The RC security function determines whether recent changes may be made
and what types of changes are allowed.  If a situation arises where the RC
security function denies the user access to recent change via RMAS or RC
channels, the SCC must be contacted so that the permission modes can be
modified.  (Hint Hint)
   The RC security function enables the operating telephone company
to decide which of its terminals are to be allowed access to which
set of RC abilities.  NOTE that all verify input messages are always
allowed and cannot be restricted, which does not help too much.
     The RC security data is not part of the ODD (office dependent data).
Instead, the RC security data is stored in relatively safe DMERT operating
system files which are only modifiable using the following message:

SET:RCACCESS,TTY="aaaaa",ACCESS=H'bbbbb;

where: aaaaa = Symbolic name of terminal in double quotes
          H' = Hexadecimal number indicator in MML
       bbbbb = 5-character hexadecimal field in 5E4 constructed
               from binary bits corresponding to RC ability.
               The field range in hexadecimal is from 00000 to
               FFFFF.

     This message must be entered for each type terminal (i.e.
               "aaaaa"="rmas1", "rmas2", etc., as noted above in
                TTY explanations).


NOTE: Order IM-5D000-01 (5ESS input manual) or OM-5D000-01 (5ESS output manual)
for more information on this and other messages from the CIC at 1-800-432-6600.
You have the money, they have the manuals, do not ask, just order.  I
think they take AMEX!

     When the message is typed in, a DMERT operating system file is created
for a particular terminal.  The content of these files, one for each terminal,
is a binary field with each bit position representing a unique set of RC
abilities.  Conversion of this hexadecimal field to binary is accomplished
by converting each hexadecimal character to its equivalent
4-bit binary string.

       ----------------------------------------------------------
       HEX   BINARY | HEX   BINARY | HEX   BINARY | HEX   BINARY
       -------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
        0     0000  |  4     0100  |  8     1000  |  C     1100
       -------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
        1     0001  |  5     0101  |  9     1001  |  D     1101
       -------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
        2     0010  |  6     0110  |  A     1010  |  E     1110
       -------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
        3     0011  |  7     0111  |  B     1011  |  F     1111
       ----------------------------------------------------------


Each bit position corresponds to a recent change functional area.
  A hexadecimal value of FFFFF indicates that all bit positions are
set to 1 indicating that a particular terminal has total RC access.  Also,
verify operations as well as lettered classes are not included in the
terminals security scheme since all terminals have access to verify views
and lettered classes.
  In addition, maintenance personnel are able to verify the security
code for any terminal by typing the following message from either
the MCC (Master Control Center) or SCCS (Switching Control Center System)
Mini terminal:

OP:RCACCESS,TTY="xxxxx";

where: xxxxx = symbolic name of terminal in double quotes.

Each bit position corresponds to a recent change functional area.

  To ensure redundancy, DMERT operating system files are backed up
immediately on disk by the SCC.
  The input message that defines the password and CLERK-ID (another name for
username) is in the Global RC feature.  This input message defines a clerk-id
and associated password or deletes an existing one. (Recall that CLERK-ID and
PASSWORD are required fields on the Global RC Schedule view 28.1 in
RCV:MENU:APPRC, but more on this later)

This new input message is as follows:

GRC:PASSWORD,CLERKID=xxxxxxxxxx,[PASSWD=xxxxxxxx|DELETE]

Note: CLERKID  can be from 1 to 10 alphanumeric characters and
      PASSWORD from 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters.

This input message can only be executed from the MCC or SCCS
terminals, and only one password is allowed per CLERK-ID.  To
change a clerk-id's password, this message is used with the same
CLERK-ID but with a different password.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the security is set up on the RC/V channel, one will see:


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5ESS login

15       WCDS0                    5E6(1)                   ttsn-cdN TTYW

Account name:


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no defaults, since the CLERK-ID and the password are set by craft,
but common password would be the name of the town, CLLI, MANAGER, SYSTEM,
5ESS, SCCS1, SCC, RCMAC, RCMAxx, etc,...
      If one sees just a " < "  prompt you are at the 'craft' shell
of the RC/V channel, the 5E login has not been set. The Craft shell is
running on the DMERT (which is a UNIX environment development operating system,
a System V hack). The Craft shell prompt is a "<".  From this shell one
will see several error messages.  Here is a list and what they mean:

     Error Message   Meaning

     ?A              Action field contains an error
     ?D              Data field contains an error
     ?E              Error exists in the message but can not be resolved to
                     the proper field (this is the "you have no idea" message)
     ?I              Identification field contains an error
     ?T              Time-out has occurred on channel
     ?W              Warning exists in input line



     Other output message meanings, from the RC/V craft menu.

     OK              Good
     PF              Printout follows
     RL              Retry later
     NG              No good, typically hardware failure
                     (ie: SM does not exist)
     IP              In progress
     NA              The message was not received by the backup control
                     process



  When inputing RC messages it is best to do it in the middle of the day
since RC messages are sent to each channel! The SCC is watching and if
there are RC messages running across at 3 in the morning, the SCC is going
to wonder what the hell RCMAC (Recent Change Memory Administration Center)
is doing at three in the morning!  However, one may be hidden by MARCH's
soaking, and the night shift at the SCC are overloaded and may miss
what is going on while correcting other major problems. So it is up to
you.


DMERT
~~~~~

    The DMERT (Duplex Multiple Environment Real Time) uses the Western
Electric (another name for AT$T!) 3B20D  Duplex processor (or 2 3B20S
Simplex processors).  The DMERT software totals nearly nine thousand
source files, one million lines of non-blank source code,
and was developed by approximately 200 programers. There are eight main
releases of this software, they are referred to as generics (like 5E4.1,
5E4.2,  to 5E8.1 also seen as 5E4(1), 5E4(2) to 5E8(1), this can be though
of as DOS version).  DMERT is similar to regular UNIX but can be best described
as a custom UNIX system based on the 3B20D, the DMERT OS can be ported to
PDP-11/70s or a large IBM Mainframe. The DMERT operating system is split both
logically and physically.  Physically, the software is evenly divided across
the five (there were seven Software Development systems all running a 3B20S
where the DMERT code was written) Software Development systems. Logical, the
software is divided into twenty-four different subsystems.  To access this
from the "craft" shell of the RC/V channel, type:

RCV:MENU:SH!

NOTE:
This will dump one to a root shell, from which VaxBuster's (Who knows nothing
about VAXen, always wondered about him) file on how to redirect a TTY may
come in useful.


Programing the 5ESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When programing the 5ESS there are things one should know, the first is that
one has a lot of power (just keep 911 in mind,  it would be foolish to even
think of disrupting anyones service.  911 is there for a reason, it should STAY
that way).  And anything one does is logged, and can be watched from the
SCC.  Note that the night SCC crew is a lot more lax on how things are done
then the day shift, so it would be best to do this at night.  I could tell you
how to crash the switch in two seconds, but that is not the point here.
Destroying something is easy, anyone can do that, there is no point to it.
All that taking down a switch will do is get one into jail, and get sued if
someone needed 911 etc,... (I think SRI is wishing they had talked to me
now).


RC from Craft Shell on RC/V Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    RC and VFY is complex from the craft shell on the RC/V channel.
This is called the input text option.  It is accessed by using the

RCV:APPTEXT:

    This gets a little complex to follow, but the best thing to do
is to order the Manual 235-118-215 Recent Change Procedures Text Interface
[5E4] it is $346.87, another good one to get is 235-118-242, for $413 even
and last, but the best is 235-118-243, this beast is only $1344.63 what a
deal. When calling the CIC they will transfer you to a rep. from your area.
Gets to be kind of a pain in the ass, but.. Anyways, back on track:



RCV:APPTEXT:DATA[,SUMMARY|,NSUMMARY][,VFYIMMED|,VFYEND][,VFYNMVAL|,VFYSCIMG]
           [,DEVICE={STDOUT|ROP|ROP0|FILE|TTYx}],FORM=...,DATA,FORM=...,END;


DATA     -  This is for more then one RC operation in the same command

FORM     -  The format that is to be used

SUMMARY  -  Turns on one line summaries on the read only printer (ROP) (DEFULT)
NSUMMARY -  Turns off one line summary logging by the ROP

VFYIMMED -  Prints out verifies (VFYs) immediately, does not wait for
            session end.
VFYEND   -  Prints out all VFYs at session end, this is the DEFULT.

VFYNMVAL -  Print verify output in name-value pair format, this must be
            directed into a file (see DEVICE).
VFYSCIMG -  Makes output into screen size image (DEFULT).

DEVICE   -  Redirect verify output to a device other than ones screen.

            ROP/ROP0   -  Send verify output to the ROP

            STDOUT     -  Send verify output to ones screen (DEFULT)

            TTYx       - Send verify output to any valid tty (such as
                         ttya and ttyv) that exists in "/dev."  You
                         must use the tty name, not tty number.
            FILE       - Send verify output to a file in "/rclog".  The
                         file will be prefixed with "RCTX", and the user
                         will be given the name of the file at the
                         beginning and end of the APPTEXT session.
END      -  END of message.



 If the parameter is not entered on the command line, it may be
entered after the APPTEXT process begins, but must be entered prior to the
first "FORM=" statement. Here is a example of a MML RCV:APPTEXT.

rcv:apptext:data,form=2v1&vfy,set="oe.entype"&lset="oe.len"&xxxxxxxx,pty=i,vfy!

  The 2V1 may look strange at first, it may help getting use to the basics
first. To just VFY telephone numbers, just do a:

RCV:APPTEXT:DATA,FORM=1V6-VFY,TN=5551212,VFY,END!

   Though I can not really explain this any more then I have just due to
time and space.  These input messages may look complex at first, but are
really simple, and much better then dealing with the menu system, but
you will need to learn RC yourself! No one can explain it to you.


Pulling AMA from the RC/V channel Craft Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Pulling AMA up is done with one command. The command is:


OP:AMA:SESSION[,ST1|,ST2];

 This command will request a report of the current or most recent automatic
message accounting (AMA) tape. ST1 and ST2 are the data streams.



Pulling up out of Service Lines, Trunks or Trunk Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   One may want to pull up all the out of service lines, trunks, or
trunk groups for many reasons.  These reasons i will not go into, but
from which lines can be set up. The command to do this from the craft
shell is a PDS command, this command is with a 'ball bat' (a `` ! '').


   OP:LIST,LINES[,FULL][,PRINT][;[a][,b][,c][,d][,e]]!

   OP:LIST,TRUNKS[,FULL][,PRINT][;[a][,b][,c][,d][,e]]!

   OP:LIST,TG [,FULL][,PRINT][;[a][,b][,c][,d][,e]]!



FULL    -   All (primary and pending) are printed. Note FULL is not the
            default when inputing this command.

PRINT   -   Print to the ROP in the CO.  (Not a good idea)

a-e     -   This is port status to match against the subset of trunks, lines
            or trunk groups that are specified.  (This is required input
            for FULL)




The 5ESS RC/V Menu Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access this shell from the RC/V channel craft shell, type:

RCV:MENU:APPRC

at the `` < '' prompt.

To access the 5ESS RC/V menu system from the MCC, STLWS, and TLWS
channel/terminals, one uses what are called pokes.  The poke that
is used here to access the RC/V Menu system on the 5ESS is 196.

Type 196 at the `` CMD< '' prompt, and you are on the RC/V menu system
of the 5ESS switch. This will cause ``RC/V 196 STARTING'' and
``RC/V 196 COMPLETED'' to be printed out on the ROP.


Either way, this will toss you into a menu system. The main menu looks like
this:

When using the RC/V menu system of the 5ESS, you may go and just keep going into
sub-menus, and fall off the end of the Earth. Here are the navigational
commands that are used to move around the menu system. As seen from the
RC/V menu system help, you see "SCREEN X out of X."  This means that there are
so many screens to go and to move between the screens you use the `` < '' to
move back (toward main menu) and `` > '' to move to the last menu. I know it
is shown in the help menu, but it is not explained like it needs to be.



Batch Input
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Batch Input feature for the 5ESS switch allows recent changes (RC)
to be entered at any date and time when the RC update would be
performed.  This allows RC input to be entered quickly, and for a large
number of inputs. The large numbers of RC input can be released
quickly in  batch mode.  The RC input can then be entered at any time,
stored until needed, and then released for use by the system
whenever needed, at any specific date and/or time.
  First and second level error correction is done during batch input.
  There are several different modes of batch input. These are:

      BMI - batch mode input - TIMEREL and DEMAND
      BMD - batch mode display
      BMR - batch mode release



BMI - Batch Mode Input - TIMEREL and DEMAND


Entering BMI (Batch Mode Input), one types `` BMI '' at the RC/V
menu prompt. Once entering, you will be prompted with whether
the input is DEMAND (demand) or TIMEREL (Time Release). DEMAND
input allows one to manual have the batch update the database,
TIMEREL is automatic. TIMEREL has one enter a time and date.
  When using DEMAND, you will be prompted for the file name. The
file will be in `` /rclog '' in the DMERT OS.
  In TIMEREL, you will be prompted with the CLERK-ID, which in this
case is the file name for the file in the `` /rclog ''. Then
for VERBOSE options, the RC SRVOR (Recent Change Service Order)
is displayed on the screen.

BMD - batch mode display


   BMD is a "mask" of RC/V done from the RC/V channel craft shell, by using the
REPT:RCHIST or a pseudo menu system. All transactions are displayed on the ROP,
though the data could also be sent to a file in the `` /rclog '' in DMERT.
   The Pseudo menu system looks like:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Summary of clerk activity

2. Activity by service order number

3. Activity by clerk ID

4. Return to view or class menu.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1  allows one to view the "DELAYED RELEASE SUMMARY REPORT."
2  produces a "DELAYED RELEASE REPORT BY SERVICE ORDER."
3  produces the "DELAYED RELEASE REPORT BY CLERK ID."
4  Return to view or class menu, self-explanatory.



REPT:RCHIST - BMD

  The REPT:RCHIST BMD (Text) command is done from the RC/V channel craft
shell. The command synopsis is:


5E2 - 5E5 (Generics)

REPT:RCHIST,CLERK=[,FORMAT={SUMMARY|DETAIL}]{[,ALL]|[,PENDING][,COMPLETE]
[,ERROR][,DEMAND]}[,DEST=FILENAME][,TIME=XXXXXXXXXX];


5E6 - 5E8 (Generics)

REPT:RCHIST,CLERK=a[,FORMAT={SUMMARY|DETAIL}] {,ALL|,b}[,DEST={c|FILE}]
[,TIME=XXXXXXXXXX];

SUMMARY         - Report selection, format by key.
DETAIL          - Report selection for Recent Change entire.
ALL             - Report all recent changes.
PENDING         - Report pending recent change input.
COMPLETE        - Report released recent changes that was successful
                  when completed.
FILE            - Name for file in /rclog
ERROR           - Report recent changes released with error.
DEMAND          - Report demand recent changes.
TIME=XXXXXXXXXX - XX - mounth, XX - day, XX - hour, XX minute, XX - Second





BMR - batch mode release


    This is the manual release (updating) of the 5ESS database. This is done
from the RC/V channel craft shell.  The command that is used is the EXC:RCRLS
input message. There is no real need to go into this message.

Adding RCF (Remote Call Forward) on a 5ESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. At the "MENU COMMANDS" commands prompt of the 5ESS main menu in the
   RC/V APPRC menu system of the 5ESS, enter '12' for the "BRCS FEATURE
   DEFINITION".  Then access screen '1.11', this is the BRCS screen. When it
   asks you to 'ENTER DATABASE OPERATION' enter "U" for Update and hit
   return.

   NOTE: When at menu '12,' you will NOT see '1.11' listed in the menu
   options.  By just accessing menu '1' you will not be able to add features.
   This is a problem with the 5ESS menu system.

2. Type in the Telephone Number. It should look like this:

          I   -   to insert a form
          C   -   to change a field on a form
          V   -   to validate the form
          A   -   to display the desired screen number
          P   -   to print the current screen
          U   -   to update the form


   Enter `` C '' to change, access filed 11 and row 1 (goto the /CFV
   wherever it may be) or add /CFR if it is not there. If it does though,
   leave the "A" (Active) field "N" (Yes or No). Change the P (Presentation)
   column to "U" (Update). Then Hit Return.

   NOTE: Different Generics have other fields, one of them being a AC (Access
   Code) field.  This field is a logical field, that mean only accepts a
   "Y" for yes and "N" for no.  Also when adding the feature to the switch,
   the row and field numbers may not be shown, but will always follow this
   pattern.  Also note that the /CFV (Call forwarding variable) feature may not
   be there, there maybe no features on the line.  These examples are from
   Generic 4 (2).  Here is a example of 5E8 (which is not used too many places,
   but this is what menu 1.11 in the BRCS Feature Definition looks like:

4. If you used the automatic forms presentation, it will have the telephone
   number already on LINE1. If not retype the telephone number you want
   forwarded. The bottom of the screen will say "ENTER UPDATE, CHANGE, VALIDATE
   OR PRINT:", type "C" for change and hit return.

5. When it says CHANGE FIELD type "9" and enter your forward to DN (Destination
   Number) including NPA if necessary. This will put you back to the "CHANGE
   FIELD" prompt. Hit return again for the "ENTER UPDATE, CHANGE, VALIDATE OR
   PRINT:". Hit "U" for Update form and wait for "FORM UPDATED".

6. Lastly, access screen 1.12, BRCS FEATURE ACTIVATION (LINE ASSIGNMENT). At the
   prompt enter a "U" for Update, and on ROW 11 Line 1 (or wherever), change
   the "N" in column "A" to a "Y" for Yes, and you are done.

ANI/F  the whole switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Automatic Number Identification failure (also called "dark calls") are
caused by variety of different things.  To understand this better, here are
the technical names and causes, note this is not in stone and the causes
are not the only causes for a ANI-F to occur.

ANF   -- Failure to receive automatic number identification
         (ANI) digits on incoming local access and transport
         area (LATA) trunk.
ANF2  -- Automatic number identification (ANI) collected by
         an operator following a failure to receive ANI
         digits on an incoming centralized automatic
         message accounting (CAMA) trunk from the DTMF decoder.
ANI   -- Time-out waiting for far off-hook from Traffic
         Service Position System (TSPS) before sending ANI
         digits.

  Though, I have always wondered how to set one up myself in a safe way.
 One way nice way to get ANI/F through a 5ESS to use a inhibit command.

      INH:CAMAONI;

The command will inhibits centralized automatic message accounting (CAMA)
operator number identification (ONI) processing. This is done from the DTMF
decoder (going over later).  This message will cause a minor alarm too occur.
If in the CO when the alarm occurs, you will here this bell all the time,
because something is always going out. In this case, this alarm is a level 1
(max to five) and the bell will ring once.
  Once this message is inputed, all calls through CAMA operator will be
free of change. So just dial the operator and you will have free calls.

To place this back on the switch, just type:

      ALW:CAMAONI;

and the minor alarm will stop, and things will go back to normal.



Setting up your own BLV on the 5ESS from the Craft shell RC/V Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Well, we have come to the fun part, how to access the No-Test trunk on
the 5ESS (this is also called adding the third trunk). I will not be too
specific on how to do this.  You will need to figure out just how to do this.
  The first thing you want to do is to request a seizure of a line for
interactive trunk and line testing. One must assign a test position (TP).

SET:WSPHONE,TP=a,DN=b
SET:WSPOS,TP=a,DN=b

          a = A number between 1 and 8
          b = The number you wish assigned to the test position

  This will chose a number to be the test number on the switch. Now using
the CONN:WSLINE one can set up a BLV.


CONN:WSLINE,TP=a,DN=b;

          a = TP that you set from the SET:WSPOS
          b = The number you want to BLV

To set this up on a MLHG (can come in real useful for those peksy
                           public packet switched networks), do a:

CONN:WSLINE,TP=a,MLHG=x-y;

          x = MLHG number, y = MLHG member number



To take set things back to normal and disconnect the BLV do a:

DISC:WSPHONE,TP=z

          z = TP 1 through 8


NOTE:

One may need to do a ALW:CALLMON before entering the CONN commands

BIG NOTE:

If you set your home telephone number as the test position, and you
have only one phone line, you are stupid.




Comments about the Underground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are a few people out there who have no idea what they are doing, and
go on thinking they know it all (i.e. No Name Brand).  It pisses me off when
these people just go off and make shit up about things they have no idea
what they are talking about.
   This file is to all the lazy people out there that just keep bitching
and moaning about not knowing where to find information.
