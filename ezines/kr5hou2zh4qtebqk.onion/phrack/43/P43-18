      The LOD Communications Underground H/P BBS Message Base Project:
     Price Listing of Currently Available Message Bases and Order Form.
                    Holdings List Version #1, 5/15/93


   This file contains:

     - Background information on the project;
     - Currently completed message bases with prices; and,
     - Order form and stipulations.

   If you have already seen some of the background information contained in the
following paragraphs, note that additional information has been added.  The aim
was to make this file as self-contained as possible.  It is approximately seven
pages in length (23K) and it should answer all of your questions.


The Project:
------------

   Throughout history, physical objects have been preserved for posterity for
the benefit of the next generation of humans.  Cyberspace, however, isn't very
physical; data contained on floppy diskettes has a finite lifetime as does the
technology to retrieve that data.  The earliest underground hacker bulletin
board systems operated at a time when TRS-80s, Commodore 64s, and Apple ][s
were state-of-the-art.  Today, it is difficult to find anyone who has one of
these machines in operating condition, not to mention the brain cells left to
recall how to operate them. :-(

   LOD Communications has created a historical library of the "dark" portion of
Cyberspace.  The project's goal is to acquire as much information as possible
from underground Hack/Phreak (H/P) bulletin boards that were in operation
during a decade long period, dating from the beginnings (in 1980/81 with 8BBS
and MOM:  Modem Over Manhattan) to the legendary OSUNY, Plover-NET, Legion of
Doom!, Metal Shop, etc. up through the Phoenix Project circa 1989/90.
Currently, messages from over 50 different BBSes have been retrieved, although
very few message bases are 100% complete.  However, not having a complete "set"
does not diminish their value.


Who Benefits From This Information?:
------------------------------------

     - PARTICIPANTS who were on the various H/P BBSes may want to see their
       contribution to history or reminisce about the "golden era" of hacking;

     - ENTHUSIASTS who came into the "scene" after most of these boards were
       down may want to see what they missed;

     - COMPANIES who may want to see if their (or their competitors') phone
       systems, computers, or networks were compromised;

     - SECURITY PROFESSIONALS/LAW ENFORCEMENT who may want to see what
       techniques were used to subvert computer security systems;

     - SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES (including their libraries) who may want to use
       the information for research in sociology or computer science as well as
       for educational purposes in courses such as Computer Law, Computer
       Ethics, and Computer Security;

     - AUTHORS/PRESS who may want to finally get the facts straight about
       "hackers;" and,

     - THE CURIOUS PUBLIC who may want to sneak a peek into the inner realm of
       the Computer Underground, especially those Restricted Access BBSes and
       their Private sub-boards where only a small handful of "the best"
       resided.

   Were the individuals involved in the Computer Underground out to start World
War III, selling secrets to the Soviets, working with organized crime,
conspiring to do evil, or just a bunch of bored teenagers with nothing better
to do?  How much did they know, and how did they find it out?  Did they have
the capability to shut down phone service of Area Code portions?  Could
they ruin someone's credit?  Could they "move satellites in the heavens?"
Could they monitor packet switching network conversations or YOUR
conversations?  The answers lie within the messages themselves.


Why is LODCOM Charging Money For The Message Bases?:
----------------------------------------------------

   As happens with most projects, the effort and monetary investment turned out
to be substantially more than originally anticipated.  With all of the high-
tech equipment available today, people sometimes forget that in the early
1980s, 14.4K baud modems and 250 MB hard drives were just a fantasy for the
home computer user.  Most messages Lodcom has recovered were downloaded at 300
baud onto 143K disk drives, with each file usually no larger than 15K in size.
One could not call a BBS and download the complete message base in 10 minutes
and save it into one file.  Literally hundreds of man-hours have been spent
copying dusty Apple ][ disks, transferring them to IBM (or typing in hard copy
versions when electronic versions were unavailable), organizing over one
thousand individual files (thus far) according to what BBS the messages were
originally posted on, and splicing the files together.  Also, after consulting
with the appropriate civil liberties organizations and our own legal counsel,
a slight editing of the messages (restricted to long distance access codes,
phone numbers, and computer passwords) had to be made to ensure that there is
nothing illegal contained within the messages.  Every effort was made to keep
the messages in their pristine condition:  40 columns, ALL CAPS, spelling
errors, offensive language, inaccuracies of various kinds, and ALL.

   Although a fairly comprehensive collection of the goings-on during a decade
of public and private computer underground activity has been accomplished,
there are more messages out there.  It is our wish to continue to document the
History of the Computer Underground.  In order to do this, and in order to
break even on what resources have already been expended (it is a LOT more than
most people realize), a dollar value has been attached to each set of message
bases.  The dollar values were kept as low as possible and range from $1.00 to
$8.00 for each H/P BBS Message Base Set.  Without your understanding and
support, this effort may not be able to sustain itself long enough to complete
the project.  A large portion of any profits will be recycled for two other
projects in the works, whose aim is to provide additional historical background
on the Computer Underground Community.  That is, no one involved is quitting
their day job :-)

   One additional note:  For those who purchase the Metal Shop Private Message
Base, 100% of the price ($4.00) will be donated to help pay for Craig Neidorf's
(Knight Lightning) Legal Defense bills (due to his successful campaign to
protect First Amendment rights for electronic publishing, i.e. the PHRACK/E911
case).


How The Prices Were Determined:
-------------------------------

Prices were determined based on the following considerations:

     - The number of years ago that the BBS operated (affected availability);

     - The total number of messages compiled (required more time to compile);

     - Its popularity and message content (anticipated demand);

     - Whether the BBS or portions thereof were deemed "elite" and, therefore,
       restricted access to a small number of users (affected availability);
       and,

     - An additional factor to account for overhead costs such as diskettes,
       diskette mailing containers, postage, time to fill orders, etc.


What Each "Message Base File" Contains:
---------------------------------------

     - A two page general message explaining H/P BBS terminology and format.

     - The BBS Pro-Phile:  A historical background and description of the BBS
       either written by the original system operator(s) or those who actually
       called the BBS when it was in operation (it took months to track the
       appropriate people down and get them to write these specifically for
       this project; lesser known BBSes may not contain a Pro-Phile);

     - Messages posted to the BBS (i.e. the Message Base);

     - Downloaded Userlists if available; and

     - Hacking tutorials a.k.a. "G-Philes" that were on-line if available.


   It is anticipated that most people who are interested in the message bases
have never heard of a lot of the BBS names shown in the listing.  If you have
seen one set of messages, you have NOT seen them ALL.  Each system had a unique
personality, set of users, and each has something different to offer. If you
decide to order the minimum, we recommend that you mix a high-priced base
($7.00 or above) with a couple of medium-priced bases ($4.00 to $6.00) and a
few lower-priced bases ($1.00 to $3.00).  This will provide you with a feel for
what was happening over a broad range of years and message quality.  Of course,
nothing beats the full set (offered at a discount, see order form).

Formats the Message Base Files are Available in:
------------------------------------------------

   Due to the large size of the Message Base Files, they will be compressed
using the format of your choice.  Please note that Lodcom does NOT include the
compression/decompression program (PKZIP, PAK, etc.).  ASCII (decompressed)
files will be provided for $2.00 extra to cover additional diskette and
shipping costs.  The files are available for:

     - IBM (5.25 or 3.5 inch)
     - AMIGA (3.5 inch)
     - APPLE MACINTOSH (3.5 inch)
     - PAPER versions can be ordered but cost triple (due to increased shipping
       costs, time to print order, and messages being in 40 column format and
       therefore wasting lots of paper...save those trees!).  Paper versions
       take twice the time to deliver but are laser printed.

Orders are expected to arrive at the requesters' physical mail box in 2-4
weeks upon receipt of the order.


FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):
----------------------------------

   QUESTION:  How long will these Message Base Files be available?

   ANSWER:  We cannot say for sure.  This is an ongoing effort and your support
            will allow us to continue until we are satisfied with having
            recovered the last decent scraps of messages out there.  Assuming
            there is a demand for these messages, all H/P BBSes of WORTH (i.e.
            NON-"codez" and NON-"warez" systems) are expected to be offered by
            the end of the Summer of 1993.  A Guesstimate of what will be
            offered is 80 to 100 Message Bases, half of which will be rather
            partial.  Orders are expected to be filled up until the end of 1993
            although this may change.  Regardless, we will send out
            notification well in advance of ceasing operations.

   QUESTION:  "Can I help out?  I have some old messages" (either on a C64,
              Apple, IBM [best for us], or printout).

   ANSWER:  Contact us ASAP!  We will work out an equitable agreement depending
            on the quantity, quality, format, and "ancientness" of the
            messages.  Your contribution will not go unrecognized.

   QUESTION:  Say if I purchase BBS "X" which has 100 messages and the next
              Version of your Price Listing shows BBS "X" now has 200 messages,
              do I have to pay the for the first 100 all over again if I want
              the other 100 messages?

   ANSWER:  No.  If a small number of additional messages are added, they will
            be sent for the price of a diskette and postage only, i.e. the
            information will be free.  If a larger number such as 100 new
            messages are added, then if you previously purchased the message
            base, the additional messages will be discounted.  Those who pay
            the Commercial Rate (corporations, government, etc.) will receive
            updates of the purchased Volume for FREE regardless of how many new
            messages there are, and LODCOM also pays for the postage and
            diskette(s).

   QUESTION:  What if I purchase the minimum order now and, when the next
              Version of the price list is released, I want to get more Message
              Bases?  Do I have to still pay the $20.00 minimum?

   ANSWER:  No.  If you are a previous customer, the minimum is cut in half,
            that is, $10.00.  Commercial customers who bought Volume #1 (the
            current "Complete Set"), are obviously not obligated to purchase
            the added Message Bases (the next Volume).

   QUESTION:  I would really like to get a feel for what one or two of the
              boards were like before I order them.  Can I get more info?

   ANSWER:  Yes.  A Sample of Actual Messages is available by performing the
            following, so long as you have TELNET access to the Internet:

   Telnet to:  198.67.3.2      [IP Address for PHANTOM.COM]
   Type:       mindvox         [To enter the Mindvox system]
   login as:   guest           [To look around]
   At prompt:  finger lodcom   [To see our Sample Messages File]

   If you do not have TELNET access to the Internet, AND your host will NOT
"bounce" a 50K file, Lodcom will send you the Sample Messages File if you
specifically request it.

Hacking/Phreaking Tutorials a.k.a. "G-Philes":
----------------------------------------------

   Along with the above H/P BBS Message Bases, LODCOM has collected many of the
old "philes" that were written and disseminated over the years.  A list of all
of them would take up too much space here, however, we can tell you that the
majority are NOT files that were originally written for electronic newsletters
such as Phrack, PHUN, ATI, etc. (with the perhaps obvious exception of the
LOD/H Technical Journal).  Those files/newsletters are readily available from
other sources.  This hodgepodge of files includes files from Bioc Agent 003,
Legion of Doom members, and many others that somehow fell out of widespread
circulation.  A Table of Contents of the collection is included but the
tutorials are all grouped together in four large files of approximately 250K
each.  This collection will have additions with each update of this file.  See
the order form for the price (price will go up as more files are added).

               LOD Communications H/P BBS Message Base ORDER FORM
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   PERSONAL RATE:  Due to the economics involved in diskettes, disk mailing
containers, snail mail costs, and time to fill orders, a MINIMUM ORDER of
$20.00 is required for all personal requests.  If all 20 message bases are
ordered (containing 5700+ messages), the cost is discounted to $39.00; if you
order $20.00 worth (the minimum) or more, you get $5.00 worth in addition as a
discount.  That is, pay for $20.00 and get $25.00 worth of message bases.

   COMMERCIAL RATE:  Corporations, Universities, Libraries, and Government
Agencies must order the complete set (Volume #1) and pay a higher rate.  For
Price Listing Version #1 Released 5/15/93 (20 boards total), the price is
