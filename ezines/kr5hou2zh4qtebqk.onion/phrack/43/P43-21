 Well, here it is, the list from hell. Sure beats the old lists of 100
or so three letter acronyms. The whole reason for this list is so that
you  can  crack almost ANY bell document.  This list came from  a  few
lists  (one in Phrack a while back)  and a few other Telephony  lists
here and there. Though it must be noted (and i want to take credit for
it)  that  well over half of the acronyms and abbreviations were typed
in by me,  inputed into my database (of course I am not about to give
out my database).
    It is always a good idea to start a database, one will learn a lot
faster.   It  is  doing  things scientific like,  and for  someone  as
compulsive as I,  solving the puzzle of the telephone company was easy
as pie. I must say that all the hackers I have meet, and talked to are
all compulsive as hell <G>.  I think it is just what it comes down to,
who is willing to learn.   Any ways here is two fields in my database,
one small part,  but worth it.   Though i do not think it will be able
to  help most of you out,  just gets into too much,  and understanding
which  acronym goes where,  and understanding what goes where is hard.
Well good luck!

Greets to Bell Northern Labs, never see too much from you press wise!
and to SRI, should have come to Cal. hah  (Don knows what I am talking
about, his funding is short)
