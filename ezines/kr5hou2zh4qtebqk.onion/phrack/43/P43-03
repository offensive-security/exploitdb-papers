Hi there!

As a beginner in Cyberspace & a new reader of Phrack, I just wanna say thiz...
IT'S X-CELLENT DUDES!!!!!.

Keep the good work!!!!!.

I only have your latest issue, and I never read previous ones, so this
is maybe old stuff... but I would like to see the Infonet network and
Datapac covered in some of UR articles... let me know if u published something
in recent issues.

Greetings from South America,

LawEnforcer.
(yes, it's an Alias!!!)

[Editor:  Well, InfoNet we've never done.  Any takers?  Datapac I
          personally scanned some time ago, but almost ALL of the
          100K of NUA's I found still work.  Maybe someone should
          take my script and re-scan it.  Anyone?  Class?  Bueler?]

****************************************************************************

begin contribution-------------------------------
VMS machines that have captive accounts often have accounts such as HYTELNET.
This is an account which will archie for you, or take you to a few select BBSs
or any of many boring things to do.  You simply log in as HYTELNET, there isn't
a password, and go through the menus.  Now, that's where the fun begins.  If
you use HYTELNET to telnet anywhere, while it is connecting, simply  type your
local telnet escape key (something like ^\ or ^]) and then........you have a
telnet prompt.  Unfortunately, if you close or disconnect, it will return to
the HYTELNET menus, and you can't open a new connection, since you're already
connected.  So, what you do is SPAWN whatever process you want.....you could
SPAWN TELNET or SPAWN FTP or SPAWN anything else for that matter.  SPAWN with
no arguments (the shell escape) does not work, however.  This works from any
captive account that telnets.  So, you can telnet to a VAX that has HYTELNET,
log in as HYTELNET, do what I told you, and then hack to wherever, since the
reports from the target site will show that HYTELNET@insert.vax.site committed
the heinous crimes that you did.
                                                  Kaneda
end contribution--------------------------------

[Editor:  Kaneda:  thanks for that tidbit.  Now I'm sure to get grief
          on IRC from someone coming from an odd site.  :)
          Give my regards to Tetsuo.  "But some day...we will be"]

Hey there a few of us use this account and wuld like to get phrack
sent to us here if at all possible... :)
We are all Australians and all read your magazine to death..
a friend of mine runs a board called shred til ya ded which is basically
a hpac and warez assortment... nothing 0 day but definately good for hacking
info... we are in the middle of getting all of your mags online at the moment
you mentioned in phrack 42 that you would like people from other countries
to write pieces about the scene there... well depending on the kind of thing
you want i would be more than happy to give it a go with some mates
thanks
Darkstar


[Editor:  Darkstar and anyone else--send me your files about your
          scenes in other countries.  Nearly everyone who promised me
          a file about their country flaked out.  You'll see who did
          send me a file later in this issue.  Other countries:  get
          off your duffs and send me a file!  We want to know what
          goes on there!  Boards, Busts, History, Hackers, Hangouts,
          Groups, Greats, Legends, Lore, EVERYTHING!]

***************************************************************************

I remember seeing a message somewhere on the WELL saying an issue of
Phrack carried listings of Viruses.  Could you tell me which one(s)?

Also, do you know of any sites which have virus listings archived ?

Thanks,

Jon Barber

[Editor:  Well, John, Phrack doesn't carry virii info.  You might
          check around for 40hex.  Personally, I think virii
          are vastly overrated hype driven onward by McAffee
          and other self-serving interests.  That is why we
          ignore them.  (That is also why I don't mention them
          when I lecture on computer security...they are no
          big thing.)]

****************************************************************************

Ok,

So I was reading Phrack 42's listing for SprintNET nodes... But there was
no information on how to access it..

What are the ACNS For the Sprintnet?  Is there a Phrack out that details
use of the SprintNET..

Would appreciate ANY and ALL, as I've never heard of it being used widely
like the Internet, and would like to know how to use it..

Jack Flash...

[Editor:  Jack...you kids are spoiled.  You and your Internet.  Hrumph.
          Remember when Arpanet was like a 20 or so Universities and
          Contractors, and tied to about 100 bases thru Milnet?  No?
          Sheesh.

          To answer your question, Sprintnet (used to be Telenet, and
          always will be to me) is a public packet switched network.
          It can be accessed in nearly EVERY city in the USA, and in
          many large cities in other countries.

          The Toll-Free dialups are:  300-2400:  800-546-1000

RE: Loop-Back

I was wondering if it would be possible for you to do something on Novell LAN
security, as we have one at my high school. I was also wondering about
bluebox tones...in my area, if you call  into the next county, sometimes you
hear what sounds like bluebox tones. I had thought these lines were digital,
and therefore, would not require tones of any type.. any ideas?

RF Burns

[Editor:  As for the Novell...check later in this issue.
          As for the MF tones...when calls go from one area to another
          it is quite common to hear multi-frequency tones.  Depending
          upon the way the call is routed, your particular pick of LD
          carrier and the equipment between you and the destination,
          you may hear these tones.  You may even be one of the lucky
          ones, and be able to seize a trunk.  Using certain LD carriers
          you can still box, but usually you are stuck with a trunk that
          can't get out of the area.  Alas.]

*****************************************************************************

Hi -

I'm a student in the MLS program here at SUNY Albany.  I
found out about Phrack while researching a paper for my public policy class,
on the ECPA and shit.

Well, I gave a fabulous 45-minute presentation on it all and then wrote
an even better paper for which I was rewarded with an A as well as an A
for the class.  Turns out John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor are heroes of
my professor as well.

So now I'm hooked.  For my thesis I'm writing a user manual for librarians
on the Internet and helping teach a class in telecommunications.

Just wanted to let you phrack-types know you're my heroes and I want to be
a member of the phrack phamily.  Can't send any money, though.  *:(

Keep the faith,
        hopey t


[Editor:  That's really great!  Usually profs are terribly anal about
          anything regarding Phrack and/or hacking.  You are very
          lucky to have had such an instructor.  Congrats on the
          class and good luck with your thesis!]

****************************************************************************

    Hi!
    I was just glancing through Phrack #42, and read the portion
that sez that all computer professionals (essentially) have to
delete this and even old copies of Phrack.
    Coupla questions: I'm a Network Administrator for a University,
do I have to comply? It's not like I am a thug from Bellcore or
anything like that. Although one of the things I am concerned with,
professionally, is the security of our systems, I am no Cliff Stoll.
If I were to catch an unauthorized visitor, I would give him the boot,
not chase him down with prosecution in mind.
    I have, of course, deleted all my old Phracks as well as #42,
but I would like to be able to re-snarf them. Let me know...

[Editor:  Well, Dan, technically Phrack could quite possibly
          be beneficial to you and assist you with your career, and
          this is the typical scenario in which we request that you
          register your subscription and pay the registration fee.
          Of course, we don't have the SS as our own personal

          As far as issues prior to 42 go, KEEP THEM!  They are
          exempt from anything, and are arguably public domain.]

Hey,
    I need to get in touch with some Macintosh phreakers. Know any?
    Anyway, are there any good war dialers or scanners out there for
    Macintosh? I need something that picks up PBXs and VMBs as well as
    Carriers.
    Thanx in advance...

[Editor:  I personally avoid the little toadstools like the plague,
          and I was unable to get a hold of the only hacker I know who

Thanks!

Hey there...

I don't know if this will get to Dispater or to the new editor.  Since the
change in editorship, the proper way to contact Phrack has become sort of a
mystery.  (The new address wasn't included in Phrack 31.)

Anyway, I'm writing to bitch about the quality of #31.  I've got two main beefs:
1. The article about fake-mail was GREAT until it turned into a "how-to"
 primer on using the info given to cause damage.  That is exactly the
 kind of thing that will end up getting you sued.  I have some legal
 background, and I'm pretty sure that the author of that article and
 possibly even Phrack itself and its editors are now open to a damn
 good argument for tortuous negligence if anyone follows the instructions
 and damages someone on Compuserve, etc.

 The argument will go something like, "Phrack set into motion a chain of
 events that led to my client being damaged."  You guys should have
 just given the info, and left off the moronic ways to abuse it.

2. The article on "Mall Security Frequencies" was copied directly from
 Popular Communications, Nov. 1992 issue.  Hell, that was even their
 cover story.  Can we say "copyright enfringement?"  If not, I'm sure
 you'll be _hearing_ it a few more times.  If I was still practicing,
 I'd call 'em up and ask their permission to sue on contingency.
 Split the damages obtained on a motion for summary judgment 50/50 with
 them.  It would only take a week and one filed complaint...

 Point is, you have opened yourselves up to get sued and lose EASILY.
 As much as I've enjoyed reading Phrack over the years, if this new
 staff continues in this manner, I'll be stuck with back-issues.

[Editor:  I think you meant 41, not 31.  But to answer your points:

          1) As long as there is a first amendment, Phrack will
             continue to print articles that some may or may not
             agree with.  Printing the blueprints for an atomic bomb
             does not make you an accomplice to those who build it
             and detonate it.
          2) Numbers are numbers.  Can we even spell "copyright
             infringement?"  If you were still "practicing..."
             We at Phrack wholeheartedly encourage you to again pick
             it up, and keep practicing and practicing until you
             get whatever it is you were practicing down pat.
             Obviously it must have been guitar, and not law.

          Such a litigious society we live in.  Suing Phrack would
          accomplish nothing.  It would not even hinder its
          publication.  Since Phrack has no money, nothing would
          be gained.  Even if fined, Phrack could not be forced to
          sell its computer equipment to pay fines, since this would
          be removing the livelihood of the publisher, thus it would
          continue its quarterly publication.  Where on Earth did
          you get such ideas?  You obviously know nothing about
          lawsuits.  Any lawyer would laugh at the thought of suing
          Phrack since it would gain nothing financially, and provide
          such a huge amount of bad publicity that even if a judgement
          were reached in their behalf it would not be worth it.
          Oh wait, you were a lawyer.  Now I know why the past tense.

          But you are correct on one point: we cannot print
          copyrighted material without permission.  You may have
          noted that last issue (among other changes) Phrack
          no longer includes full text of news items without
          prior permission from the publisher.  That was the
          ONLY thing that worried me about publishing Phrack, and
          so I changed it.

          We at Phrack welcome constructive criticism, but at least
          have the nerve to email directly, rather than hide behind
          an anonymous remailer.  That way, someone could have
          responded to you in a more direct and expeditious manner.]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a student at ukc in England and wish to subscribe to Phrack receiving
it as email at the following address ks16@ukc.ac.uk thank you and keep up the
good work.

We use unix and I would be interested in getting a copy of su (switch user)
which looks for the user file passwd.su in the users home directory.  I don't
know much about unix, but I do know it would need to run from my home directory
and access the kernel.

Many thanks for any help you may be able to give.

[Editor:  Its "SIR"  hehe.  Sir Bloodaxe.  In any case, if anyone would
          care to draft up this modification to su and send it in

I had some beef with Rack's article in PHRACK 42. I've attached a
writeup of comments; you're welcome to a) forward it to him, b)
shitcan it, or c) publish it.

thx,
-Paul

My background: I've been into the scene for about 12 years. My day job
is writing unix s/w for a NASA contractor. My night job... well, never
mind that. I have a strong amateur interest in crypto, and I'd like to
share some of what people in the usenet/Internet community have been
kind enough to teach me.

Racketeer sez:

>encryption techniques -- so what makes you think you're so fucking bright?

One real reason for this reaction is that people _have_ been studying
encryption for 100 years or so. As a result, many simple cryptosystems
are continually being reinvented by people who haven't ever made even
a simple study of cryptosystems.

Imagine if someone came up to you and said "Wow! I just found a
totally K00L way to send fake mail! It's radical! No one's ever
thought of it before!"

You'd laugh, right? _Anyone_ can figure out how to forge mail.

Well, _anyone_ can come up with the n-th variation of the Vigniere or
substitution cipher.

An even more important reason for their 'tude is that cypherpunks are
suspicious by nature.  A key principle of crypto is that you can only
trust algorithms that have been made public and thoroughly picked
over. Without that public scrutiny, how can you trust it?

The fedz' Digital Signature Standard (DSS) got raked in the crypto and
industry press because the fedz wouldn't disclose details of the
algorithm. "How do we know it's secure?" the cypherpunks asked. "We
won't use it if we don't know it's secure!"

Point being: (for those of you who skipped over) cypherpunks trust NO
ONE when the subject is encryption algorithms. Maybe J. Random Hacker
has come up with a scheme faster and more secure than, say, RSA. If
JRH won't share the details, no one will use it.

Racketeer goes on to talk about DES. One important thing to note is
that the unix crypt() function has NOTHING to do with DES. Here's part
of the SunOS 4.1.2 man page for crypt():

     crypt implements a  one-rotor  machine  designed  along  the
     lines  of  the  German Enigma, but with a 256-element rotor.
     Methods of attack on such machines are  widely  known,  thus
     crypt provides minimal security.

It's fairly clear that for a known-ciphertext attack (i.e. you
have a block of encoded text, but neither the key nor the plaintext)
will, at worst, require 2^56 decryption attempts. Various schemes for
parallel machines and so forth have been posted in sci.crypt. Does the
NSA have something that can crack DES? Probably.

Remember that DES is mostly used for short-lived session keys. ATMs
are a good example; they typically use a DES key for one communication
session with the central bank. New session, new key. DES is _not_ very
well suited for long-term encryption, since it can probably be
attacked in "reasonable" time by a determined, well-equipped opponent.

Now, on to PGP. Pretty Good Software was indeed threatened with a
lawsuit by Public Key Partners (PKP). PKP holds the patent on the RSA
public-key algorithm. (Many people, me included, don't think that the
patent would stand up in court; so far, no one's tried.)

The nice thing about PGP is that it offers IDEA and RSA in a nice
package. When you encrypt a file, PGP generates an IDEA session key,
which is then encrypted with RSA. An opponent would have to either a)
exhaustively search the entire IDEA key space or b) break RSA to
decrypt the file without the password.

Racketeer also mentions that PGP can optionally compress files before
encryption. There's a solid crypto reason behind this, too. One
well-known and successful way to attack an encrypted file is to look
for patterns of repeated characters. Since the statistical frequencies
of word and letter use in English (and many other languages; some
folks have even compiled these statistics for Pascal & C!) are
well-known, comparing the file contents with a statistical profile can
give some insight into the file's contents.

By compressing files before encrypting them, PGP is moving the
redundancy out of the text and into the small dictionary of
compression symbols. You'd still have to decrypt the file before you
could do anything useful with that dictionary, or even to determine
that it _had_ a signature!


[Editor:  Well, Rack is not to blame for all complaints I got about the
          file.  I printed a file that was several KBytes short of
          complete.  I noticed it seemed odd, but was assured by
          Rack, TK & Presence that I had received the correct file.
          I was misinformed, and should have known better than to
          print a file I should have known was incomplete.  I apologize
          to Rack & to all of you.

          About the other gripes:  Rack, care to reply?]

In issue #42 of Phrack there was an article about the USPS' practice of
selling change of address information without consumer consent.  I sent
the supplied form letter and carbon copied my congressman and senators.
Today I received a reply from the USPS Records Office.

April 1, 1993

Dear Mr. Rosen:

This concerns your recent Privacy Act request for accountings of
disclosure of mail forwarding information you have provided to the Postal
Service.

Disclosure of your forwarding address might have been made to individual
requesters by post offices or to subscribers to the National Change of
Address File (NCOA) by an NCOA licensee.  The NCOA is a consolidated file
of all forwarding information provided by postal customers and stored on
automated media.  Listholders may subscribe to NCOA to obtain the new
addresses of individuals for whom they already have in their possession
the old address.

For disclosures made by post offices, we are in the process of querying
the Washington, DC postmaster for any accountings.

For disclosures made from the NCOA system, we will begin querying NCOA
licensees all of which keep logs identifying the particular subscribers to
whom they have given NCOA information.  This accounting will not identify
with certainty the subscribers who have in fact received your new address,
but will give you a list of all subscribers receiving NCOA service for the
relevant time period and thus might have received your address.

Because a large number of requests like yours are being received, there
will be a delay in responding.  Requests are being processed in order of
receipt and you will be sent the accountings as soon as possible.  Your
patience is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Betty E. Sheriff
USPS Records Officer


[Editor:  Thanks for sending that letter in!  Amazing that someone
          in the maze of red tape even thought to make a form letter
          to respond.  I think I'll demand a disclosure as well.]

                           My Problems With Clipper

                               by Chris Goggans

The introduction of the new government backed encryption chip, Clipper,
has become a much debated issue.  I like many others have a large number
of problems with the chip and the problems it may bring in the future.

Why should we believe that this algorithm is robust?  For years
and years the NSA has backed DES as the encryption standard, when
cryptoanalysts have consistently brought its strength into question.
Additionally, the NSA has forced companies to submit their routines
for analysis before allowing them to be distributed commercially.  At
times they have even requested that the algorithms be purposely
weakened (we will assume that this was so they could more easily
decipher the encrypted data.)

With this in mind, why should we now meet anything endorsed by the NSA
with anything but suspicion?  And the fact that they refuse to release
the algorithm for security reasons even further adds to the suspicion
that this chip is either inherently weak and easily broken by the NSA
or that there is a backdoor in the algorithm that will allow the NSA
to effortlessly view any data encrypted with the Clipper.

Assuming that the government is on the level (for once), and they cannot
decipher Clipper-encrypted data without legally obtaining keys from
the assigned escrow agents.  The idea that the government will have to
go before a judge and show just cause for needing the keys pacifies some,
but from my own personal experience, the government will always get
what they want.  If the Secret Service could get a search warrant to
enter my home based solely upon one posting to an electronic bulletin board,
they could certainly obtain the necessary keys needed to decipher my
speech.  In fact, most non-technical persons will become needlessly
suspicious upon the mere mention of someone using encrypted speech mechanisms
and be more easily swayed to release the keys to law enforcement.

Should Clipper be adopted by various government agencies for use, this could
have serious trickle-down effects upon the lives of regular citizens.
Let's say the military decides that they will use Clipper.  They will then
most likely require their various contractors to use it as well.  Then
after continued use, the contractor may begin to tell its other customers
to communicate with them using Clipper also.  Usage could grow
exponentially as more and more people become comfortable with the use
of the secure communications devices until it becomes a defacto standard
without any legal pressures to use it ever mandated by Congress.
Should Congress mandate its use in any form, even if only within the
government itself, this potentiality will rapidly become reality.

If Clipper eventually receives such accepted use, anyone using any other
type of encryption will be immediately suspect.  "Why aren't you using
the chip?  What do you have to hide?"  The government may even outlaw
the use of any other encryption technologies, and if America
has become comfortable and satisfied with Clipper such a law may go
unchallenged, after all, only spies, child pornographers and drug dealers
would have something to hide, right?

As the world's computer networks creep ever further into our daily lives,
and the speed and power of supercomputers multiplies every year a rather
frightening scenario emerges.  Since the government is a major funder of
the Internet, who is to say that Clipper won't become the basis for
encrypting over its lines?  As our country moves closer to ISDN and the
PSTN and the PSDN's become more intertwined, who is to say that Clipper
won't be the basis for encryption since companies like AT&T already
endorse it?

Imagine if you will, a massively parallel supercomputer, the likes of which
may not exist yet, in a special room in Ft. Meade, or buried underground
in New Jersey, that consistently decrypts all communications and
sorts it according to communicating parties.  Then through the use of
AI, the computer decides whether or not such communication presents a threat
"to national security."

The structure of the telephone network already supports such an arrangement.
The purpose of the NSA allows for such an arrangement.  The advances in computer
technology will give the potential for such an arrangement.  If Clipper is
tainted, yet accepted, there will be no more privacy in America.

Perhaps my view of the government and their ultimate intentions is way off
base.  I sincerely hope so, as I do not want to be forced to take the mark
of this beast to conduct my business dealings and to live my life in peace.
