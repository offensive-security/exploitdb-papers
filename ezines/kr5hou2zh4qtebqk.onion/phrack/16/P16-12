	 "Phone Companies Across U.S. Want Coins Box Thief's Number"
		  From the Tribune - Thursday, Nov. 5, 1987


 SAN FRANCISCO	-  Seven  telephone  companies	across	the country, including
   Pacific Bell, are so frazzled  by a coin box thief that they are offering a
   reward of $25,000 to catch him.

 He's very clever, telephone officials say,  and is the only known suspect  in
   the country	that is	able to  pick the  locks on  coin boxes  in telephone
   booths with relative ease.

 He is believed responsible for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from
   coin boxes in the Bay Area and Sacramento this year.

 The  suspect  has  been  identified  by  authorities  as  James Clark, 47, of
   Pennisula,  Ohio,  a	machinist  and	tool-and-die  maker,  who is believed
   responsible for coin box thefts in 24 other states.

 Other companies  sharing in  the reward  are Ohio  Bell, Southern Bell, South
   Carolina Bell,  South Central  Bell, Southwestern  Bell, Bell  Telephone of
   Pennsylvania and U.S. West.

 Clark	allegedly  hit	pay  phones  that  are	near  freeways and other major
   thoroughfares.  Clark, described  as	5  feet  9 inches tall, with shoulder
   length brown hair and gold-rimmed glasses, is reported to be driving a  new
   Chevrolet Astro van painted a dark metallic blue.

 He was recently in Arizona but is believed to be back in California.
