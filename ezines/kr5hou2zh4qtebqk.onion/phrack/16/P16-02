BELLCORE Information	  by The Mad Phone-man
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you've broken  into the  big phone box on the wall, and are looking at a
bunch of tags with numbers and letters on them. Which one is the modem line?
Which one is the 1-800 WATS line?  Which one is the Alarm line? Bell has a
specific set of codes that enable you to identify what you're looking at.
These are the same codes the installer gets from the wire center to enable him
to set	up the line, test it, and make	sure it	matches the  customers order.
Here are some extracts from the Bellcore book.

First lets take a hypothetical line number I'm familiar with:
     64FDDV 123456
-------------------------------------------------------------
The serial number format:

	Prefix +  service code + modifier +   serial number +
digits:	1,2	 3,4	   5,6	7,8,9,10,11,12    continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	 Suffix	+  CO assigning circuit number +   segment
digits:	13,14,15	    16,17,18,19	      20,21,22
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The important shit is in the 3rd thru 6th digit.

Now the last two positions of real importance, 5 & 6 translate thusly:

Modifier Character Position 5
------------------------------

INTRASTATE	    INTERSTATE
-------------------------------------
   A			B	   Alternate data & non data
-------------------------------------
   C				  Customer controlled service
-------------------------------------
   D			E	   Data
-------------------------------------
   N			L	   Non-data operation
-------------------------------------
   P				  Only offered under intra restructured
				      private line (RPL) tariff
-------------------------------------
   S			T	   Simultaneous data & non-data
-------------------------------------
   F				  Interexchange carriers is less than 50%
-------------------------------------
			  G	   Interstate carrier is more than 50%
				      usage
==============================================================================

MODIFIER CHARACTER POSITION 6
--------------------------------------------------------------

  TYPE OF SERVICE	Intra LATA
--------------------------------------
ALL EXCEPT US GOVT	US GOVERNMENT
--------------------------------------
       T		   M	  Circuit is BOC customer to BOC customer
				      all facilities are TELCO provided
--------------------------------------
       C		   P	  Circuit is BOC/BOC and part of
				      facilities or equipment is telco
				      provided
--------------------------------------
       A		   J	  Circuit is BOC/BOC all electrically
				      connected equip is customer provided
--------------------------------------
       L		   F	  Circuit terminates at interexchange
				      carrier customers location
--------------------------------------
       Z			      Official company service
--------------------------------------
			  Interlata
       S		   S	  Circuit terminates at interexchange
				      carriers point of term (POT)
--------------------------------------
       V		   V	  Circuit terminates at an interface of a
				      radio common carrier (RCC)
--------------------------------------
       Z			      Official company service
--------------------------------------

			   Corridor
       Y		   X	  Corridor circuit
--------------------------------------
			   International
       K		   H	  Circuit has at least 2 terminations in
				      different countries
--------------------------------------
			   Interexchange carrier
       Y		   X	  Transport circuit between interexchange
				      carrier terminals.
----------------------------------------

So 64FDDV would be a private line data circuit terminating at a	radiocommon
carrier.  Other examples can be decoded likewise.

Enjoy this information as much as I've had finding it.
