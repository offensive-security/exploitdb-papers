=============================================================================

What's this?  This is an updated announcement and invitation to DEF CON II,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc..

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994 (Speaking on the 23rd and 24th)
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel

So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part II?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we're heading to Vegas!

Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:

"DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years." -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World

"Toto, I don't think we're at COMDEX anymore." -- CodeRipper, Gray Areas

"Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald's Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds."  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine

DESCRIPTION:

Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
We attempt to bring the underground into contact with "legitimate" speakers.
Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences.

While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the
evil hackers to party and wreak havoc, it's just not the case.  People come
to DEF CON for information and for making contacts.  We strive to distinguish
this convention from others in that respect.

WHAT'S NEW THIS YEAR:

This year will be much larger and more organized (hopefully) than last year.
We have a much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.
Because of this we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect
speaking to run Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new
things expected include:

> An Internet connection with sixteen ports will be there, _BUT_ will only
  provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
  bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
  network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection.

> There will be door prizes, and someone has already donated a Cell Phone
  and a few "Forbidden Subjects" cd ROMs to give away, thanks to Dead Addict.

> Dr. Ludwig will present his virus creation awards on Sunday.

> A bigger and better "Spot The Fed" contest, which means more shirts to
  give away.

> More room, we should have tables set up for information distribution.
  If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
  designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
  convention space.

> A 24 hour movie / video suite where we will be playing all type of stuff.
  VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titles to show, or bring your own.
  We'll use a wall projector when not in use by speakers.

> Midnight Tech Talks on Friday and Saturday night to cover the more
  technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions.

WHO IS SPEAKING:=============================================================

This list represents almost all of the speakers verified to date.  Some
people do not want to be announced until the event for various reasons, or
are waiting for approval from employers.  A speaking schedule will go out
in the next announcement.


Philip Zimmerman, Notorious Cryptographer & Author of PGP.

Dr. Ludwig, Author of "The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses," and
    "Computer Viruses, Artificial Life and Evolution"

Loyd Blankenship (The Mentor), Net Running in the 90's and RPG.

Padgett Peterson, Computer Enthusiast, Anti-Virus Programmer.

The Jackal, A Radio Communications Overview, Digital Radio and the Hack Angle.

Judi Clark, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.

Gail Thackery, (Of Operation Sun Devil Fame), Topic to be Announced.

To be Announced, The Software Publishers Association, Topic to be Announced.

Toni Aimes, Ex U.S. West Cellular Fraud, Cellular Fraud Topics.

Mark Lotter, Cellular Enthusiast, Hacking Cell Phones.

Lorax, The Lighter Side of VMBs.

Peter Shipley, Unix Stud, Q&A on Unix Security.

George Smith, Crypt Newsletter, Virus Topic to be Announced.

Cathy Compton, Attorney, Q&A Surrounding Seizure Issues, Etc.

John Littman, Reporter and Author, Kevin Poulson, Mitnick, and Agent Steal.

Red Five & Hellbender, Madmen With a Camcorder, Who Knows?

Erik Bloodaxe, Phrack Editor, Wierd Wireless Psycho Shit.. Stay Tuned..

There should be a few round table discussions on Virus, Cellular, Unix and
something else surrounding the industry.

I'll name the rest of the speakers as they confirm.  I'm still working on
a few (Two?) people and groups, so hopefully things will work out and I can
pass the good news on in the next announcement, or over our List Server.

============================================================================

WHERE THIS THING IS:

It's in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel is as follows:

        The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078

        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Triple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax

        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap.

   NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON II
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, 'cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Try to contact
   people on the Interactive Mailing List (More on that below) and
   hook up with people.  Don't let the hotel people get their hands on
   your baggage, or there is a mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas
   has killer unions.

OTHER STUFF:

I'll whip up a list of stuff that's cool to check out in town there so if for
some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
sites in the city of true capitalism.  If anyone lives in Las Vegas, I
would appreciate it if you could send a list of some cool places to check out
or where to go to see the best shows and I'll post it in the next
announcement or in the program

-> I am asking for people to submit to me any artwork, pictures, drawings,
   logos, etc. that they want me to try and include in this years program.
   I am trying to not violate any copyright laws, but want cool shit.  Send
   me your art or whatever and I'll try and use it in the program, giving you
   credit for the work, of course.  Please send it in .TIF format if it has
   more than eight bit color.  The program will be eight bit black and white,
-> in case you want to make adjustments on your side.


PLEASE DONATE "STUFF" FOR THE GIVEAWAY:

    We are trying to raffle off interesting and old functional items.  If
you have anything such as old computers, modems, weird radio stuff, books,
magazines, etc that you want to get rid of, please call or mail me with
what it is, or bring it along.  I don't want to waste peoples time giving
away rubber bands or anything, but pretty much anything else will go.

*** NEW MAILING LIST SERVER ***

We've finally gotten Major Domo List Serv software working (Kinda) and it
is now ready for testing.  MTV spent a lot of time hacking this thing to work
with BSDi, and I would like to thank him.  The purpose of the list is to
allow people interested in DEF CON II to chat with one another.  It would
be very useful for people over 21 who want to rent hotel space, but split
costs with others.  Just mention you have room for 'x' number of people, and
I'm sure you'll get a response from someone wanting to split costs.  Someone
also suggested that people could organize a massive car caravan from Southern
Ca. to the Con.  My attitude is that the list is what you make of it.  Here
are the specifics:

Umm.. I TAKE THAT BACK!!  The mailing list is _NOT_ ready yet.  Due to
technical problems, etc.  I'll do another mass mailing to everyone letting
them know that the list is up and how to access it.  Sorry for the delay!


MEDIA:

Some of the places you can look for information from last year include:

New Media Magazine, September 1993
InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2, #3 (Fall 1993)
Unix World, ???,
Phrack #44, #45

COST:

Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We're gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
cheapness.

contest will be announced at the DEFCON conference in Las Vegas, July 22-24,
1994. If you can be present, an official award will be bestowed on you at
that time.

         *************************************************************

                                    Details

         *************************************************************

The philosopher Friedrik Nietzsche once said that if you want to kill
something, you must laugh at it--and laugh at it deeply. So there should be
little wonder that political satire is as old as politics itself.

Is there something going on in the political arena that you abhor, that makes
you sick, that is just plain wrong? Well, here's your chance to make a
mockery of it. I've always had this idea that if someone wrote a sufficiently
witty virus that really addressed the issues the way the people (not the
press, not the politicians) saw them, it might just get passed around by
people voluntarily.

Let's find out.

Write a virus that is itself a political satire. I don't mean a virus that
simply displays a message. I mean a living entity whose every move--whose
every action--is politically motivated. If you need more than one virus to
make your point--perhaps two viruses working together, or something like that,
that is fine.

         -----------------------------------------------------------
Let me give you a simple example: The Political Correctness Virus

This virus is a spoof on the "political correctness" movement--which is just
a form of self-imposed censorship--that is sweeping American intellectual
circles, particularly colleges and universities.

This virus is a memory resident boot sector virus which maintains a list of
politically incorrect words on your computer system. It also hooks the
keyboard interrupt and monitors every keystroke you make. If you type a
politically incorrect word into the computer, the PCV springs into action.

Politically incorrect words are ranked at three different offense levels.
When the PCV encounters such a word, it determines what offense level that
word is, and acts accordingly.

The least offensive words merely register a beep. More offensive words cause
a beep to sound for 10 seconds. The most offensive words cause a siren to
sound for two minutes, locking the system for that duration. If you turn the
computer off before the two minutes are up, the virus will stop the boot
process for five minutes, with sirens, when you turn it back on. If you allow
the siren to complete, then you can proceed.

The virus has two different word lists, both stored in an encrypted and
compressed format. The list is selected at random when the system is
infected, after which it cannot be changed. The first list is the "proper"
list of political correctness no-no's. For example, a word like "sodomite" is
among the worst possible offenses. The second list is an inverted list of
no-no's.  This list trys to force you to use "sodomite" by flagging words
like "gay" and "homosexual" as no-no's.

If you allow the PCV to live in your system for three months without getting
a single flag, you are given the supreme honor of viewing the word list
assigned to you and adding a word to it. If you get more than 3000 flags in
a lifetime, the virus will force you to enter a politically correct word
before allowing you to start the computer, since you are obviously unwilling
to submit to its censorship.

The virus also uses powerful means to prevent disinfection, so that, once you
get it, you can't get rid of it without a major effort.

         ------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I know you can get a lot more creative than this--so do it! Design your
virus carefully, so that everything it does has meaning. Then send it in.

Here are the criteria we'll use:

1. Originality: Your virus must be an original work. Do not send us anything
that is not 100% yours. Your message should be original too. Do not just
ape what everybody else is saying, especially the media. Also, a refined wit
is much to be preferred over vulgarity. Vulgarity is a substitute for
original wit. Foul language, porn, etc., are out. Destructive features should
be incorporated only if they are VERY appropriate (perhaps if you are
commenting on real live genocide in your country, or something like that).
In general, though, destructive features will hurt you, not help you. The one
exception is modifying anti-virus programs. That is considered to be
CONstructive activity.

2. Creativity: Make us laugh, make us cry. Amaze us with how bits and bytes
can say something about politics and issues.  Think of it like this:
displaying a message on the screen is like reading a text file. What we want
is the equivalent of a multi-media extravaganza. Use all the system's
resources to tell your message. Don't be afraid to write a virus that has
some weird mode of infecting programs that tells a story, or to write one
that sends faxes to the White House, or sends an automatic request for reams
of free information to some government agency.

3. Functionality: The virus has to work. If it only works on some machines,
or under some versions of DOS, or what-not, then that will count against
you. The better it is at infecting systems and moving around, the better off
you will be. So, for example, if you write a file-infector, make sure it can
jump directories, and--if you're up to it--migrate across a network.

4. Political incorrectness: Since computer viruses are politically incorrect,
their message should be too. If you send us a pro-establishment virus, then
you will not win this contest. A word to the wise: think twice about what's
correct and what's not. Many positions are only superficially incorrect,
though they are really quite fashionable among the establishment. Look at it
this way: if you could get a well-written letter expressing your view
published in a big city newspaper, then it's not sufficiently incorrect.
There are a LOT of ideas that are unofficially censored by society--
especially the media and academia. They tend to make themselves out to be the
rebels, but they are really the establishment. If you can't think of anything
creatively incorrect and sufficiently obnoxious then you shouldn't be writing
viruses in the first place.

                             How to Submit an Entry

You may mail your entry to American Eagle Publications at the above address,
or you may e-mail it to ameagle@mcimail.com. Alternatively, you can submit it
by dialing the Crypt Infosystems BBS and uploading it there. To get on to the
system quickly, efficiently and anonymously, log on as VIRUS, using the
password CONTEST.

An entry consists of:

1. A complete copy of your virus, both source and executable files.

2. If the political satire isn't perfectly obvious, send a verbal description
of how the virus works and why it does what it does. This is especially
important if you are not an American and you are commenting on something that
has not received worldwide attention. I don't care if you're Bulgarian and
you're commenting on something we've never heard of--just make sure you
explain it, or we won't understand and you'll lose.

3. If you want to be recognized for your work, include your name (real or
handle), and a way we can get in contact with you.

By submitting an entry, you grant American Eagle Publications, Inc. the right
to publish your virus in any form. You agree not to make your virus public
prior to July 25, 1994. If you do, you are automatically disqualified from
the contest.

For the sake of privacy, you may encrypt your entry and send it in with the
following PGP key (which we highly recommend if you have PGP):
