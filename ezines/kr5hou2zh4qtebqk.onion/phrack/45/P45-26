The Novatel 8325 is a bag-style portable cellular telephone. It is known as a
'ProClassic' in Novatel MarketSpeak. Two different handsets (control units) are
used with the 8325 transceiver: the 4130 and 5160. My phone has the 5160.
The handsets appear very similar: I doubt there is any functional difference
between them. Earlier transceivers, such as the 8320, contain many of the same
features as the 8325, though the hidden menus are accessed with different
codes. The only other code I know of is #746, which is the code for the 8320
CFG menu.

Terms: Throughout this article, I will refer to things without explaining them
each time. If you get lost, refer to the table below.

NORMAL = the phone is in this mode when it is not locked, or in either of the
hidden menus, or in the 'user' menus accessed by the MENU key. The screen will
display either READY or SCANNING when in normal mode. This is the mode the phone
is in when it is first turned on.

LOCKED = when the phone displays LOCKED, a code must be typed to enter normal
mode. The default code is 1234. The telephone can be locked using [FCN] 1 [SND]
from normal mode. The phone must be locked before entering in any of the codes
to access the hidden menus described below.

TBL = troubleshooting mode = the hidden menu accessed with 546*. This is a
menu supposedly know only to Novatel, not even their dealers are supposed to
know about it. According to Novatel, some of the features in this menu could
destroy the phone if improperly set. Scare tactics? You decide.

CFG = configuration mode = the hidden menu accessed with 510*. This is used by
dealers to set up a subscriber's service. As far as I know, there is nothing
particularly dangerous about this mode, but Novatel is touchy about it
nonetheless. I take no responsibility for any damages.


Troubleshooting Mode - TBL

First, lock phone with [FCN] 1 [SND]
Then, enter 546* on the keypad. The phone
will not make tones for each key pressed.

TBL 8325    /___ This is what shows up on my phone.
REV NA0C    \    Yours may be different.

You are now in troubleshooting mode. You may page through the functions
by using the arrow keys, or access the functions by number, by hitting #
(The screen will display DIR PAGE ACCESS) and then the function number,
from the chart below. Note that on initially entering Troubleshooting mode,
you are on function 37. Toggle with the [SND] key, unless otherwise noted.
