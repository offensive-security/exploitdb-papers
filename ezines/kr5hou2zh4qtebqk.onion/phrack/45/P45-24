Chris,

I have enclosed the most current newsletter from FRB is this email.
Mondo 2000 just came out and has a 14 page article on Guerilla media with
a lot of information about FRB and others.  We are trying to encourage as
many people as possible to obtain transmitters and take to the air
waves.  If this happens, it will be very difficult for the FCC to do very
much, especially in areas of the country where the nearest FCC office is
500 to 1000 miles away.  It is extremely important that the stranglehold
on the free flow of ideas, information, art and culture be broken not
only here but around the world as well.  China has just clamped down on
broadcasting there, only state approved outlets and all satellite dishes
have been banned was well.  We intend on putting an international
shortwave station on the air, first broadcast will be New Years Eve.  It
will be a call for no borders, tear down the walls and party down.  We hope
to get people in the Bay Area who are in exile from their home countries
for political activity to do 10 to 20 minutes programs in their
native language which we will broadcast around the world on the 20 meter
band.  Needless to say, the FEDS and their corporate masters are going to
take a rather dim view of all this.  Their armies and police can not be
everywhere at once, however.

Anyway, good to hear from you.  Let me know if you need further information.

               ***** FCC Uses 20 SF Cops to Obtain ID *****

     In a scene resembling a French noir film, one person associated with
San Francisco Liberation Radio was detained by 20 SF police officers until
his ID could be presented to FCC agent David Doon.  At approximately 9:30
PM on Wednesday, September 22, Richard Edmondson was approached by David
Doon who asked for identification.   After refusing to produce
identification and answer any questions,  Richard drove away and was
stopped on Webster St. by SF police officers who blocked off the entire
northbound lane of the street with 8 vehicles.  A confused scene ensued
wherein the police officers had virtually no idea of what was going on or
why they such massive backup had been called.  Richard was ordered to get
out of his vehicle with his hands up and in clear sight by clearly agitated
SF police who subsequently handcuffed him.  SF police officers were heard
to say "who is this guy" and "what do we have him for" - for several
minutes these questions went unanswered.  By the time the FCC agent arrived
to examine Richard's ID there were at least 20 SF police officers on the
scene.  After learning of what was going on some of the officers were
clearly exasperated at having their time wasted by this FCC agent.  A few
were amused and asked for information regarding San Francisco Liberation
Radio's frequency and broadcast schedule.  After Richard's ID was verified
he was released without any further consequences by the SF police.
     Richard described it this way, "Before it was all over there were at
least 20 police officers on the scene.  They were all so pumped up with
adrenaline you would have thought I had committed the crime of the century.
It was clearly irresponsible for this FCC agent to call for such a massive
response without giving clear reason or instruction to the SF police.  When
police officers go into a situation not knowing the details they naturally
assume the worst.  For one dark moment I feared my life was in danger."
     Clearly, this was an obvious case of overreaction by FCC agent David
Doon who clearly endangered the life of Richard Edmondson by calling in
such a massive police response.  The FCC must be held accountable for the
actions of their agents who use such extremely excessive and reactionary
methods to suppress a growing micro power broadcasting movement.  It would
have sufficed for David Doon to have written down the license plate # of
Richard's vehicle and run a DMV check.  As more micro power broadcasters go
on the air in the Bay area and Northern California we can anticipate
further actions by the FCC to harass and intimidate those involved.
However, we shall not be moved by their threats and police state tactics.

           ***** BUSH RADIO UNDER ATTACK IN SOUTH AFRICA  *****

4 October, 1993

AMARC Solidarity Action Network received this urgent demand today
from Bush Radio, a community radio project in Cape Town, South
Africa.

An Action Alert was first issued in support of Bush Radio when its
equipment was seized in May. For a copy of that Alert, send a request
to amarc@web.apc.org.30th September, 1993

OPEN LETTER RE:  PROSECUTION OF BUSH RADIO

To Bush Radio's Members, Users Friends and Supporters

Bush Radio is being prosecuted for starting a community radio
station. We are charged on three counts:
     1.   illegal broadcasting
     2.   illegal possession of broadcast apparatus, and
     3.   obstructing the course of justice.

These charges are being leveled at two of our members, who face
stiff penalties: R10,000 and/or 3 years imprisonment each on the
first two counts alone.

The first court appearance is set for October 13. We now need
your support to stop the victimization of genuine community radio
before it even gets going.

Bush radio is a community radio initiative, owned and controlled
by its membership, a wide range of organizations and individuals.
For more than two years we planned and talked about going on air.
Our attempts to get a broadcasting license from the Ministry for
Home Affairs were repeatedly frustrated, and our membership
eventually decided that we should go ahead without one.

So from 4 - 8 pm on Sunday April 1993, listeners on the Cape
Flats heard a mix of programs produced and presented by our
"networkers" (volunteer producers from the community). Scores of
other people were there, and all of them had a chance to go on
air, most of them for the first time in their lives.

In the week that followed the state seized our transmission
equipment, effectively silencing us on the eve of our second
broadcast, scheduled for May 1st. About six weeks later we were
warned that the state was considering laying charges against us.
Last week charge sheets were served on our lawyers, to appear
before a regional court on October 13th.

For the state to take such action at this time seems to
contradict their professed commitment to a more open South
Africa. We are being charged in terms of laws inspired by
apartheid at the very same time that new legislation passes
through parliament - including bills for the transitional
Executive Council and an Independent Broadcasting Authority,
drawn up by parties at the negotiations.

The enforcement of these charges could have serious consequences
for us at Bush Radio. For an organization which employs a staff
of only two people, we do a disproportionate amount of work, and
can ill afford to be spending time on defending unnecessary legal
action. Bush Radio runs a range of training programs aimed at
bringing new voices into the broadcasting environment. We work
with a number of organizations, producing programs that are
distributed either on audio-cassette or on other radio stations.
Substantial time and energy is invested in building up a network
of volunteers, the backbone of a truly participatory community
radio. A lot of time is spent providing support to others who
want to start radio stations in their own communities.

Despite our modest resources, Bush radio has become something of
a "flagship" for the emerging community radio sector in SouthAfrica.
For us to be criminalized could weaken the growth of this
new sector which holds such real potential for communities
wanting to control their own development.

We were always open and peaceful in our methods, and feel that
this treatment is misplaced. To drag us through the courts is a
waste of time and money, not only for Bush Radio but also for the
taxpayer who foots the bill.

We hope the charges might be dropped, and seek your support in
making our case. What can you do?

At this stage we ask that you write letters. They should be:
     "To whom it may concern,"

The content of your letter would depend on your relationship with
Bush Radio.

If you are a member, we'd like you to say why you think it's
inappropriate for us to be prosecuted, and include a statement of
solidarity.

If you are a client, we'd like you to say why you think it's
inappropriate for us to be prosecuted, and include a statement of
solidarity.

If you are a client, we'd like to hear about the value of service
you have derived from Bush Radio, and we would like you to be
specific about what we did together.

If you are a friend, or supporter, please write whatever you feel
is appropriate, and we'd appreciate comments on how this kind of
action undermines confidence in the nature of change in our
country.

Please send these letters to:
                     BUSH RADIO at fax no.:
                        +(27-21) 448-5451

                     and send originals to:
                         P.O. Box 13290
                         Mowbray, 7705
                    Cape Town, South Africa

We should receive these letters by Friday 8th October, or as soon
as possible thereafter.

Thanking you in anticipation,

JEANNE DU TOIT
Secretary for the Coordinating Committee

                   ***** FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION *****


>From Zeke Teflon's book - Complete Manual of Pirate Radio

     Freedom of communication is a basic human right. Like all rights,
freedom of communication consists of being able to exercise your
abilities with- out interference. Government cannot give you your
abilities, but it sure as hell can (and will) interfere with you when
you exercise them. Government cannot give you rights. It can only
take them from you. If all governments (goons with guns forcing others
to follow their dictates through violence and coercion) were to
cease to exist, human rights would certainly not cease along with
them.

     The naive objection could be raised that while governments cannot
give you rights, they can protect them by preventing your fellow citizens
from interfering with you. That's the theory. In practice, governments
rarely 'protect' citizens' rights, and then only when it suits their
political purposes. Invariably, when governments feel the least
bit threatened, they place their own 'security' needs above the human
rights they supposedly safeguard. Through- out history the vilest
and most consistent violators of human rights have been governments.
Governments, along with their bedfellows, organized religions, have
been responsible for the overwhelming bulk of human rights violations
in every human civilization.

     We cannot look to government to protect our rights. We have to do
it ourselves, and an effective means of doing that is by exercising
our rights. Use 'em or lose 'em.

                     ***** Connecting to the Net *****

     One of the best tools for the immediate transfer of news, information
and discussion is the Internet.  With any basic computer and a modem, world
wide access is just a few keystrokes away.  In the Bay Area one of the best
Interest access providers is CRL, for a flat rate of $18 per month you will
have all the Interent resources available to you.  Resources include the
ability to send email to anyone else in the world who is on the net as
well, check out hundreds of news groups for the latest and weirdest
happenings, send breaking news and information to other community
broadcasters, etc.
     At the moment we are working on a way to digitally record and compress
5 to 15 minute audio spots into a computer file which can be sent anywhere
in the world where there is a computer to receive it.  With an inexpensive
digital recording and playback card which plugs into any basic PC system,
micro power broadcasters will be able to send and receive these spots to
and from anywhere in the world.  This completely bypasses the rather
expensive satellite feeds and makes for a much more decentralized system of
distribution.  If you are interested in this project please contact us.
To reach CRL in regards to an Internet account give them a call (415) 381-
2800.

      ***** MICRO POWER BROADCASTING, TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE *****

     With circuit board dimensions of 2" x  4 1/2", a five
watt FM micro power transmitter is capable of covering a community
3-5 miles in radius.  Such compact and inexpensive technology has
the possibility of giving each and every community its own voice.  Stephen
Dunifer with Free Radio Berkeley has been designing and developing
this unit along with a series of other transmitters, amplifiers and
antennas over the last year.  Mass produced RF transistors and
communications IC's have made it possible to design and build stable and
clean transmitters and amplifiers for a fraction of the cost of brand name
type accepted equipment.  Even the entry level 5 watt kit, using only three
transistors, is very stable once tuned and set up.
     Even more sophisticated phase lock loop (PLL) frequency
control designs are not that much more expensive to design and produce.  At
this moment, several individuals are working on low cost PLL designs
which should meet current FCC requirements for frequency stability.  When
these designs are finished they will be available in kit form and
assembled as well (for shipment outside US only).
     What does it take to put a micro power broadcasting operation
on the air ?  First off, less than $500.  A basic 5 watt FM transmitter,
output filter (very necessary to reduce output harmonics), coax cable
(50-100 ft RG8), antenna and power supply (battery or 12 volt regulated
and filtered unit) is going to cost about $125-150.  This is assuming
assembly of kit and antenna.  Next, a VHF power meter ($30-$40 at
Radio Shack), a dummy load (make from resistors or $19 at Radio Shack)
and a frequency counter ($50-150) are needed for tuning and keeping
things optimized.  Beyond those requirements one sort of audio source
(line level -10 dbm, .3 volts) or another is needed to feed the
transmitter.  This source can be a walkman type cassette unit, a mixing
board, tape deck, etc.  Granted this is not a professional studio but for
low budget community operations, it does not take top end gear.  Creativity
and determination as shown by many community stations can certainly make
up the difference.
     Once all the equipment has been assembled and arranged,
a suitable place needs to be found for the operation and setting up
the antenna.  With FM, which is line of sight transmission, the higher
the antenna the better.  Depending on the regulations and political
climate of the country in which you live, your operation may need
to be portable for rapid set-up and break down.  That seems especially
true here in the United Corporate Snakes of America.
     At the core of this is the potential to set up loosely
coupled autonomous networks of communication around entire planet,
outside the grasp of corporate/government control.  This is the goal
of the Free Communications Coalition, the umbrella organization which
is being formed to support, defend and encourage micro power broadcasting.
     Micro power technology makes this possible through a
combination of low power. inexpensive FM, AM, TV and shortwave
transmitters.  Free Radio Berkeley, San Francisco Liberation Radio and
other interested parties will be placing an international shortwave station
on the air (100-300 watts initially at 40 meters -  7.4 to 7.5 Mhz range,
increasing to 1000) sometime in November, 1993.  If we had to use
tube designs, doing such an operation would be impossible due to the
portability requirements.  Instead, relatively inexpensive transistor
designs allow to us build linear shortwave amplifiers capable of output
powers exceeding 1000 watts while running off a bank of lead acid
batteries.  Certainly, within the normal definitions, 100 to 1000
watts on shortwave is definitely beyond the usual micropower definition.
However, when right wing evangelical ranters are running 100-500 KW it
could be considered to be micropower. At the moment, Free Radio Berkeley is
offering an entire line of transmitter and amplifier kits for FM
broadcasting along with antenna and equipment designs.  Assembled
units are available for sale outside the US only.  A rather effective
antenna can be built using common hardware store parts for about $10.  Our
work will be expanding to include UHF & VHF TV, AM and shortwave designs.
     We would like to find other engineers and technically
inclined people to help increase these efforts since we are a rather
small design and development operation.  Further, we need such technically
inclined people to act as advisors and facilitators in the process
of helping people build, test, tune, and setup their transmitters
and antennas.  That way, we can create a pool of people across the
country and world who will be available to lend a technical hand to
those who wish put micropower broadcasting operations on the air.

Let a thousand transmitters bloom

                     Freedom of Broadcasting in Italy

     Just for you to know, back in 1974/75 Radio Milano International in
Milano (not associated with us) started as the first private-pirate
FM station in this country, operating from a van which kept moving
around the town to avoid the PTT authorities (equivalent of the FCC).
RMI brought the first regular stereo programs to Italy, good music
not heard before on state channels, as the other stations which came
after them did. They also went to court and fought for "free", private
radio and freedom of speech over radio and won against the old Postal
law which considered broadcasting as State Monopoly. Today RMI is
one of the major national radio networks with hundreds of repeaters
all over the Italian peninsula, while thousands of private radio and
TV stations obtained authorizations to broadcast legally over the
years.
     If you have a story to tell on pirate radio, or information to share
(voice/paper/email), please get in touch with us. On shortwave we reach
also many European Pirates who would love to hear from you. (We indeed
carried "legally" some of the pirates programs in the past in order
to offer them better coverage to their "alternative" programs. Something
we would also like to do again the future.)

Please send email to 100020.1013@compuserve.com, including a phone
number and times when we can call possibly you from Europe for an
interview. We will guarantee anonymity if so desired, since our Shortwave
transmissions may also be heard in the USA. We'll love to hear from
you! 73, Alfredo --- Alfredo E. Cotroneo, President, NEXUS-International

Notes from the Net on the FCC

One person writes about his FCC bust on the Usenet newsgroup
alt.radio.pirate:

When I was busted in 1984, the FCC used a tan-colored
buick passenger car.  The passenger seat had been ripped out and was
replaced with a rack of receiving equipment--nothing special, just
commercially-available stuff.  In the trunk was a pair of batteries
driving inverters.  The engine had a second alternator to charge the
batteries.  Beneath the vinyl roof was a direction-finding antenna
array that was connected to an indicator on the dashboard.  They'd
just drive in the direction indicated until they reached the transmitter.
     That car served 3-4 states in the Northwestern US.  How
do I know all this?  After the guy finished writing me up, I asked
him to show me his equipment.  After all, I showed him mine.  He started
to say no, but then changed his mind since there was nothing secret
involved.

Don Hackler responds:

     When I was engineering an directional AM broadcast station,
the station was inspected by two FCC engineers driving a similar car.
The roof had been removed and replaced with a fiber glass replica
of the original.  The antennae were embedded in the new roof, and
there were no indications of anything `special' about the roof, inside
or out.
     I was given a ride in the car to go check some of the
monitor points with a field-strength meter.  The passenger bucket
seat had been replaced by a 3 foot tall rack on a swivel mount, so
the driver or a passenger in back could operate the equipment.  The
rack had a slip cover made of upholstery vinyl that matched the car's
interior.  They refused (nicely) to let me see the equipment, but
said it was just standard equipment; i.e. a spectrum analyzer and
some general coverage receivers.
     I never understood why they didn't allow a peek, but
I assumed it was probably some policy they were following.  That was
my first, and so far only, FCC inspection.

             ***** Why Support Micro-Power Broadcasting? *****


     Number One:  The issue is freedom of speech.  It's truly
shocking what the Federal Communications Commission has allowed to
happen. Media access is becoming too restricted for regular people
to get their message across.  As each day passes,  radio, television,
and newspaper media gets gobbled up pac-man style by big outfits like
Sony/CBS, GE/NBC, ATT,  ABC, Time-Warner Communications, Hearst, Gannett,
Disney, Ted Turner, or even Fox.  Our local media mogul, James Gabbert,
owns an AM, FM, and television station in the same area.  Middle America
gets bombarded with religious broadcasters and urban areas get millions
of watts of commercial crap beaming out from huge towers.  Arbitron
and Neilson decide which stations have what percentage of the listening
audience.  This situation must be changed so that truly free communication
can have a chance to survive.  In the 90's we need some space on the
broadcast bands for community radio and television.  Cable TV is promising
hundreds of channels to choose from, but most of this stuff will be
generated by the existing media networks.  The problem here is that
minority opinions are not heard.  Censorship can not be tolerated
in a democratic society.  Freedom of information is what we need.
     Number Two:  The technology has changed.  It used to be very expensive
to run a radio station.  With modern electronics, however, small radio
stations can be on the air with a minimal investment.  In fact, people
in Japan have been doing micro-power broadcasting  for years.  Most
people in the U.S. just have AM, FM, and TV receivers.  To reach these
people, you usually have to buy advertising time on a commercial station.
That's assuming some station is willing to broadcast your tape!  What we
want is true public access to the airwaves for everyone, not just
the rich and powerful.  The cloud of secrecy about broadcasting has
lifted and now we know that media power has been stolen by our own
government,  and sold to the highest bidder.  People need media access
because human beings have a natural need to communicate with each
other.   Cable TV and Audio service should feature input from the
community at large.  The old concept of standing on a soap box and
calling out to your fellow citizens will not work in the computer
age.
     Number Three:  Health Concerns about Radio energy, in large doses,
it is considered by some to be a real health hazard. Incidence of
leukemia and cancer runs high among men who work on high power transmitting
towers.  People in San Francisco get blasted with literally millions
of watts of energy coming from Sutro Tower.  This is because some
radio and television stations want to be picked up 100 miles away.
Scientific opinion on the effects of exposure to radio waves varies quite a
bit, but if you're one of those people living up near Sutro Tower, maybe
you should move.  Micro-power is the sane way to use radio and tv.  The
space on the radio and tv dial should be spread around to all interested
parties, not just a small group of companies.  Broadcast power levels
for all stations should come down to safer levels.

     From San Francisco Liberation Radio:  Each SFLR program closes with
the words: "Fascists are like cockroaches.  Shine a light on them and they
scurry away.  And together, you and I can be the light."  Richard Edmondson
of SFLR, author of that slogan, said, "Well, first and foremost of all it
seemed like a truism, and it seemed like the sort of phrase to end a radio
program with - catchy."
     Stephen Dunifer with Free Radio Berkeley added, "Yes, but cockroaches
do not carry guns".  One of Free Radio Berkeley's favorite tag lines is
"Are you going to continue to live the lie or are you going to act the truth
?
     Both San Francisco Liberation Radio and Free Radio Berkeley have been
carrying a lot of very diverse and interesting programming ranging from
Food Not Bombs Radio Network programs to Jello Biafra declaring that
Urinalysis is Freedom to local street interviews to an interview with the
former program director at Pacicifa station WPFW in Washington, DC.  If you
are interested in producing programs, conducting news gathering and
interviews, etc. or have tapes of your band, performance piece, etc.  or
wish to help out in any other way, please contact either Free Radio
Berkeley or San Francisco Liberation Radio.  Tapes may be mailed to the
return address on this newsletter in care of Free Radio Berkeley.  Let your
voices and performance art be heard !

                               In the Media

     Within the last few months, a considerable amount of media attention
has been focused on Micropower Broadcasting.  Articles have appeared in the
East Bay Express, SF Weekly, Bay Guardian, Oakland Tribune, San Jose
Mercury, Daily Cal, SF Chronicle, Berkeley Voice and New York Daily News.
CNN put together a  news story about Free Radio Berkeley which aired
nationally and was picked up and rebroadcast by Channel 2 in Oakland.
     More coverage is expected to be forthcoming.  An article may appear in
the New York Times.  KQED radio is working on a story.  A fifteen page
article on guerilla media will be in Mondo 2000, due out the first of
November.  Channel 31 (Marin County) is covering one of the broadcast
operations in San Rafael.  A press and info packet is going to be sent out
around the country.  Any help you can offer in the area of community and
media outreach would be greatly appreciated.  It is our intent to build an
international movement and coalition.  Contact the Free Communications
Coalition (510) 464-3041

                        HELP TAKE BACK THE AIRWAVES
                  FREE COMMUNICATIONS COALITION MEETING

Saturday, November 13 - 5 PM
809 B Allston Way, Berkeley

     With the dramatic increase in publicity (Free Radio Berkeley made the
front page of the Sunday New York Times - Oct. 24) and response we have
experienced in the last month or so, it is rather important that all of us
who are concerned with the defense, support and promotion of micro power
broadcasting come together to plan and create a strategy which will lead to
the Free Communications Coalition (the Peoples' FCC) becoming an
international umbrella under which micropower broadcasting can flourish.

     To that end, you are invited to attend the meeting of the Free
Communications Coalition on Saturday, November 13 at 5 PM.  It will be held
at 809 B Allston Way (between 5th & 6th streets) in Berkeley.  This will be
a pot luck dinner meeting, bring a vegetarian dish to share.  Following, at
8PM will be a video benefit, see above for further details.
