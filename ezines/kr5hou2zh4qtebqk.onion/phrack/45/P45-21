What IS a UDC?!
"""""""""""""""

The Universal Data converter (UDC), by Applied Computing Devices,
was put into widespread use in 1979.  A UDC is used primarily in
connection with a variety of switches, to log everything the switch does,
and report it to the Central Office in a standard format, allowing the
monitoring and reporting of a variety of different switches by one processor
without the need of understanding each individual switch. This lets the
Telco-Trouble shooters monitor exactly how much traffic is passing
thru a given switch.  Exact number of calls, busys & fraud attempts, are
some examples.  A UDC will give detailed reports of such activity, as
well as hold it in a buffer file which you can view for your own excitement.
The real purpose of this piece of hardware is to buffer data, convert it
to a standard format, and send it on it's merry way to the Central Processor.
Information may be buffered for up to an hour, before being able to be
received by the Central Processor.

Which Switches use a UDC?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Well, apparently, nearly all switches owned by a tel-co use a UDC
for their daily reports.  Here is a list of the switches of which I know
may be connected to a converter:


       At&t Autoplex 100
       ITT/North 1210
       ITT/North NX-1E
       ITT/North "1200" Series (DSS-1)
       GTE GTD-1 (Automatic Electric no. 1 EAX)
       GTE GTD-2 (Automatic Electric no. 2 EAX)
       GTE GTD-3 (Automatic Electric no. 3 EAX)
       GTE GTD-5
       Motorola EMX-250
       NEC NEAX-61
       NEC ND-20S
       Northern Telecom DMS-10
       Northern Telecom DMS-100
       Northern Telecom DMS-200
       Northern Telecom DMS-250
       Northern Telecom DMS-300
       Northern Telecom SL-1  (Seen these around locally)
       Northern Telecom SP-1 PABX
       Stromberg Carlson DCO
       TRW Vidar ITS-4
       TRW Vidar ITS-4/5
       TRW Vidar ITS-5
       Western Electric 5 ESS
       GTE PBX's (GTD-1000, GTD-4600)



General Configurations:
"""""""""""""""""""""""

A UDC may be configured in several ways.  A UDC consists of up to 6 ports.
Port 0 is usually a dialin line, in which it is connected to a 300/1200
baud modem, so that GTE employees may call to check their switch
information in the field.

Port 0 may also be a dedicated line, which is linked to a computer somewhere
important, but if this is the case, you can't have found it anyways, so don't
worry about it. (Unless of course you another indial port possibly 1)

Port 2 is usually the line which is hardwired to the data output of the
switch.  This port receives the messages of a switch, analyses the data,
buffers it, and waits until it is told to send the data to the CP, which
may be every time the buffer flips, which of course is configured by hardware.
It is not required that port 2 be the hardwire, although it is just the
most common configuration.

Port 1 & 3-7 are also multi-use ports , which may be configured
either for a dedicated line, or a standard phone line, just like port 1.
The difference between this port and port 0 however, is that this port may
also be used to test lines other than the hardware set report line #.
(More later.)

NOTE:  ANY of these ports can be completely different depending on the
       setup of the UDC's cards, and which slot they are in...


The UDC can be configured (though I have never seen it this way) so that any
of the six ports can preform the functions instead of the first three.
If you find a UDC, be sure to check all the ports, and not just three.

The general idea of this box of tin is that it will monitor any
switch, collect data into a buffer, and store it until it need be
converted and polled by the SAC.  When the data is sent out, it is sent
in standard UDC format, regardless of the type of switch, therefore any
switch may be monitored by the SAC without having to be converted on
the spot.

Yeah Great what the ?#!$ do I do?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""'

Scan your local area for all numbers ending in 99xx or 00xx, often
(with GTE anyways) the prefix may be something like 446-9988, or something
outright obvious.  Once you find one, you will know, because you will
get one of two things.  Depending on the configuration of the UDC,
you will either begin getting a dump of data, which will go into detail
about the switch information, or you will get a prompt:

*B*>

When you receive this prompt, you can make your life easy by typing
HELP in all caps, for a menu of commands, which will seem important at
first (don't fool yourself).

Each letter between *'s represents a separate processor (yes even this tin
box has more than one!  These letters will be in the menu
when you type HELP.  To change processors, you will need to hold control
while pressing the letter of the processor you wish to change to.

Here is a list of commands for each processor:

                        The Basic processor
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*B*> DATE               Display the system Date

*B*> DATE mm/dd/yy      Set the date to mm/dd/yy

*B*> DIAGNOSTIC         This puts you in debug mode for the UDC's program
                        When typing this command the UDC will respond with
                        "PASSWORD" and will not echo letters.  If the password
                        given is correct, you will get a prompt like this:
                        *B*> DIAG
                        PASSWORD 305      > I enter the good password<
                        DEBUG 1,3         > 1,3 are the ports in use <
                        ?
                        At this point you can reboot the UDC by typing:
                        ? G
                        (ADDR)=1000       > I tell it to jmp to 1000 <
                        Then all hell will break loose...trust me!
                        O.k. well it will look like it anyway...


*B*> HELP               Duh um, a Menu

                        It IS possible to patch to modem ports, but I don't
                        recommend it...all GTE numbers have their own COS.

What is all this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RMT data is the data transmitted to the UDC by the switch.  This data
is formatted in such a way that it tells the UDC what is happening and what
has already happened since the last buffer flip.  This data is then converted
to a standard format to be transferred to the Central Processor.  For examples
of switch output, refer to the switch example list further in this article.

Here is an example of the System Output data, after being translated into
standard format by the UDC:


The first two lines of the System Output data will contain the values
of the 19 status registers as follows:

       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

000  00345 00003 00013 00000 00005 00000 00005 01903 00012 00000
001  06800 01021 01101 01065 00000 00003 00007 02435 00000 00000

       10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19

The registers are as follows:

0       UDC control program number (usually 345, newer versions may be diff.)
1       UDC control program version (1,3,5,etc.)
2       Hour at buffer flip (active to passive)
3       Minute at buffer flip (active to passive)
4       Number of buffer flips since power on (65535 maximum)
5       Power interrupt flag (99 if fewer than two intervals have occurred
        since the power interrupt or hard restart; 0 otherwise)
6       Number of reports in the buffer
7       Total number of meters in this buffer (including headers)
8       Hour at buffer flip (passive to active)
9       Minute at buffer flip (passive to active)
10-13   Strapping Card signature
14      Total number of errors since last had reset or power up
15      Number of soft restarts since last power-up or hard restart
16      Number of buffer flips since last soft restart
17      Address of last error which caused a soft restart
18-19   unused


When a traffic report is to be sent, the following header will be sent
(in the System Output) to the UDC processor(s) to tell the traffic processor
to begin buffering the report:

       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

190  65535 00008 00022 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000
191  00004 00027 00078 00700 00800 31227 00074 00000 00002 00018
192  00078 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000

       10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19

The registers for the header are as follows:

0       65535 (This signals the beginning of the switch report)
1       Message type obtained from the 'type' field of the RMT
2       The number of registers used by the message, including the
        10 registers of this header.
3-9     unused (00000)



Ok ?!  Now what?!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well now that I have explained all the commands, the data formats, etc,
of the UDC, you can now check the RMT or TRAFFIC buffers to see exactly
what type of switch you are monitoring.  Here are some examples of the
Data format for the following switches:
