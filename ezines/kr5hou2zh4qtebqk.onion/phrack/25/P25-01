     Welcome to Phrack Inc. Issue 25 -- The beginning of Volume Three of the
Phrack Inc. Newsletter.  We have been around since November 17, 1985 and we're
proud to be still going strong.

     In this issue, we feature two really decent articles that deal with Unix
and a special index file that chronicles all 25 issues of Phrack Inc. to date.
Special thanks for help in the compilation of this file goes to Prime Suspect,
Red Knight, and Hatchet Molly.  Also, more details concerning SummerCon '89
appear in Phrack World News XXV and again, further information will be released
as it develops.  We hope you enjoy it!

     As always, we ask that anyone with network access drop us a line to either
our Bitnet accounts or our Internet addresses...
