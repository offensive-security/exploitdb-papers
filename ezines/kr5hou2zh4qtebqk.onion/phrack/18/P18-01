    Well, Phrack Inc. is still alive but have changed editors again. I,
Crimson Death am now the new editor of Phrack Inc.  The reason why I am the
new editor is because of the previous editors in school and they did not just
have the time for it.  So, if you would like to submit an article for Phrack
Inc. please contact:  Crimson Death, Control C, or Epsilon, or call my BBS
(The Forgotten Realm) or one of the BBSes on the sponsor BBS listing (Found in
PWN Part 1).  We are ALWAYS looking for more files to put in upcoming issues.
Well, that about does it for me.  I hope you enjoy Phrack 18 as much as we at
The Forgotten Realm did bringing it to you.  Later...
                                                  Crimson Death
                                           Sysop of The Forgotten Realm
