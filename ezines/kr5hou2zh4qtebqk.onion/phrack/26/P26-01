     Greetings and welcome to Issue 26 of Phrack Inc.  Things are really
beginning to heat up as SummerCon '89 rapidly approaches.  Be sure to check out
Phrack World News for further information concerning this incredible event.
You do not want to miss it.

     This issue we feature The Disk Jockey's personal rendition of the events
that can occur in the criminal legal process (after all he should know).  Some
of the terms and situations may vary from state to state due to slight
differences in state laws.

     We also present to you a file on COSMOS that is written from more of a
security standpoint rather than hacker intrusion tips.  The Future Transcendent
Saga continues in this issue with a file on NSFnet and the third appendix of
the never ending series.  This particular appendix is geared to be used as a
general reference to chapter three of the FTSaga, "Limbo To Infinity."  As this
file is more of a complied directory than actual "how to" knowledge, we just
consider it a Phrack Inc. release.

     As always, we ask that anyone with network access drop us a line to either
our Bitnet or Internet addresses...
