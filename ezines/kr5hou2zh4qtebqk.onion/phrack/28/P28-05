Introduction:  After reading the earlier renditions of schematics
               for the Pearl Box, I decided that there was an
               easier and cheaper way of doing the same thing
               with an IC and parts you probably have just laying
               around the house.


What Is A Pearl Box and Why Do I Want One?

     A Pearl Box is a tone generating device that is used to make
     a wide range of single tones.  Therefore, it would be very
     easy to modify this basic design to make a Blue Box by
     making 2 Pearl Boxes and joining them together in some
     fashion.

     A Pearl Box can be used to create any tone you wish that
     other boxes may not.  It also has a tone sweep option that
     can be used for numerous things like detecting different
     types of phone tapping devices.


Parts List:

        CD4049 RCA integrated circuit
        .1 uF disk capacitor
        1 uF 16V electrolitic capacitor
        1K resistor
        10M resistor
        1meg pot
        1N914 diode
        Some SPST momentary push-button switches
        1 SPDT toggle switch
        9 Volt battery & clip
        and miscellaneous stuff you should have laying around the house.

Explanation:

     The 2 wires that lead from the main part of the circuit
     should be connected to the center poles on the toggle
     switch.  Put the 2 wires to the pot on one side and the 2
     wires going to the push-buttons to the other side.  That way
     you can switch between tone sweep and the favorite tones you
     like (the push-button side).

     To keep tones that you want to use frequently like 1850 Hz
     then all you have to do is put in a variable resistor and
     adjust it to where you have the correct tone, then just put
     a push-button switch on the line.  You can link them
     together in a chain, etc.  There are many other good
     modifications to make to the box so have fun and be smart.
