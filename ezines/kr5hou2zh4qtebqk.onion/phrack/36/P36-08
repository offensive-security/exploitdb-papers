               [Sung to the tune of Get in The Ring by G-n-f-R]

Why do you look at me when you hate me?
Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too?
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don't even understand why the fuck you even care
And I don't need you jealousy
Why drag me down in your misery
And when you stare you don't think I feel it
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I'm havin phun ya know I can't conceal it
'Cause you know you'd never cut it in my game, oh yea
And when you're talkin about our sociology
I'll be writin' down your obituary...History

You got your agents with
The Bellcore cash injections
Trumped up charges and implications
Beatin' off with your "spy" operations
Who are you to criticize our publication
Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you, I got my vices
I've got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice...PAIN!!

And that goes for all you punks in the press
That want to start shit by spreadin' lies
Instead of the things we said
That means you
Ed Schwarz at WGN Radio
Richard Sanzda
Gary Collins at Hour Magazine
Geraldo River at CBS         ** [CBS being partially owned AT&T]
What you pissed off 'cause Opra Winfrey gets more ratings that you do?
Fuck You
Suck my fuckin' dick

You be liein' to the fuckin' public
Tellin' them your doin' a such favor for society
[while crack dealers like Mayor Barry who should be tried for treason
get off with slap on the wrist. FUCK YOU!]
While they be payin thier hard earned tax dollars
Printin' lies, Startin' controversy
You want to antagonize me?
Antagonize me motherfucker
Get in the ring motherfucker
And I'll kick your bitchy little ass, punk

I don't like you, I just hate you
I'm gonna kick your ass, oh yea!

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!!!!

You may not like our integrity
We built a world out of anarchy

And in this corner weighing in at 450 lbs, Phrack Incorporated!!!!

Get in the ring!

Yea, this song is dedicated to all the Phrack fuckin' Incorporated
Fans that stuck with us through all the fucking shit
And to all those opposed...Hmm...Well

Come and and listen to my story 'bout boy named Craig.
Called "Mad-hacker", but is just pullin' your leg.
Then one day he was writin' up a Phrack.
Down came the door with a great big crack.

Foley that is, Secret Service!, FBI!

Well, now old Craig's a million in debt.
Lost his cds and his brand new 'vette.

Mitch Kapor said, "There's someplace you need to be."
So he packed up his apple and moved to DC.

Washington that is!, Lawyers!, Cash flow!

Erik B was a ham...yes a big ham.
He was born with an ego that was big as mountain was he.

Erik B was ham...yes a big ham.
And he told all the ladies he was hung like a mighty oak tree.

>From the dark sun glasses he never takes off to the heal of his K-Mart shoes.
The bitchenest, horniest, drunkenest man that a hacker ever knew.

Erik B was a ham...yes a big ham.
With a mouth like a sewer and so full of manure was he.

He wishes he was nazi serving under Herman Hess.

Been caught phreaking, once, when I was five!
I just tried phreaking, just as simple as that
Well it's just a simple fact
When I want a call and I don't want to pay for it
I dial up a code
and I dial up a code

Hey all right! I get by!
It's mine! Mine all mine!
hey!

Yea, my girl she's one too.
She gonna get on telenet, just type in microwire
Get a NUA for me
She'll call right through the outdial
Call right throught the outdial

Hey all right! I get by!
It's mine! Mine all mine!
Get c0dez!

Sat around the terminal. Sat and laughed.
Sat around the terminal and laughed
And we did it just like that, did it just like that.

Hack in the place where you live
Now dial out
Think about telnet, wonder why you have it now
Hack in the place where you work
Now dial up
Think about tymnet, wonder why you have it
If you are real board hack with SUN
Carry a lap-top to help along

A PAD is there to move you around
If You're not careful your hands will be bound

Trees would be falling

He who tries will be wasted
Feed me lies, now you've shut your trunks!

I'm the dog who phreaks
Can't shove my tones in a switch
Won't you come and save me?

     [Sung to the tune of Keep on Rockin in the Free World by Neil Young]

There's CERT on the sceen
Trying to get a clue
Hackers typin on thier screen
Phreaks with boxes that are blue
There's a warning sign in CUD ahead
There's a lot of people sayin
We'd be better of dead
Don't feel like Satan
But we are to them
So I try to forget it anyway I can

Keep on hackin in the free world (4x)

I see a phreak in night
With some trash in his hand
There's an old CO
With a garbage can
Now he takes the trash away
And he's gonna learn a lot
Goes home to hack some more
And he's not gonna a stop

Keep on hackin in the free world (4x)

Got a thousand points of light
On our modems, man
Got a brand new Lexicon in my hand
He found department stores
with carbon paper
Got Crimson Death & Dispater
They say Phrack is back
Gonna keep hope alive
Got codes to crack
Got dumpsters to dive

Keep on hackin in the free world (4x)

              [Sung to the tune of "Fade to Black" by Metallica]

Accounts just seem to fade away
Losing access every day
Getting lost within some shell
I have lost the will to hack
No more passwords left to crack
There are no more nets for me
I need virtual reality

Nets arent what they used to be
Someone's always logging me
Access Barred, this cant be real
No more packets left to steal
Now they've installed public key
And they're using Secure ID
Security awareness taking dawn
I was root, but now root's gone

Rerouted my call to save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
The SS greet me warm, now I will just say goodbye
