 |    With all this shit in the news and now a book about cyberpunks, we have|
 |a bunch of lame assholes who think they are cyberpunks running around      |
 |blackening the name.  In response to this we'd created this g-file so      |
 |everybody can tell the lamers from the real cyberpunks.  Most of these     |
 |wanna-be cyberpunks will probably be offended by what we're going to say,  |
 |because the description of what defines a real cyberpunk doesn't apply to  |
 |them.  Remember though, cyberpunk is mostly an attitude (this g-file       |
 |describes physical manifestations of this attitude), and real cyberpunks   |
 |don't get upset over something written in a g-file.                        |
