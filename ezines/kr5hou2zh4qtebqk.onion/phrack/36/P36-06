     From its explosive beginnings in the summer of 1984 to the present day,
the group known as "The Legion of Doom" has been enshrouded in secrecy.  Now
that our numbers have been corrupted, and the hope of once regaining the
immense power we wielded over the years has faded, we offer to the last
remaining fragments of the underground from which we arose the secret knowledge
that kept our members at the apex of knowledge and beyond the grasp of security
officials.

     It is our hope that through wide circulation of this material that perhaps
some future enthusiasts will seek the truth from within, and gain the knowledge
and wisdom necessary to endure the trauma of illumination.


HISTORY

Initially, the idea of combining modern technology with ancient wisdom was
formulated as a type of joke.  One particular system was proving extremely
difficult to penetrate.  One member remarked rather off-handedly, "Why not ask
the Ouija board for passwords?"  This was laughed about for several minutes but
ultimately it was decided that it should be tried.  Two members set up the
board and began concentrating on the computer system in question.  After
several minutes an entity was contacted.  When asked what the root password was
on the UNIX system we had discovered, it answered "rambo".  "Rambo" was the
password.

Several more trials were done, and more than two thirds of them ended with
positive results.  It was decided at this time that there should be an inner
order to the Legion of Doom for those members who shared an interest in
learning more about the occult and its uses in a hacking forum.  At that time
it was decided that there would be seven members admitted.  From that time
forth, there have always been seven members.  The circle will be broken upon
the incarceration of our initiates in the coming new year, and our control
over the planes will be lost.

What follows are several steps to increasing one's knowledge of the occult and
use of this information in a computer setting.


OUIJA

In our experience we have found that it is best to attempt this type of
communication with two persons.  It is extremely important that one not attempt
to contact an entity using the Ouija alone.  When there is only one psyche
involved, the spirit can fixate on it with great ease and the chances for
possession or extreme mental duress is quite high.

Sit facing a partner with the Ouija touching each lap.  Each person should keep
one hand on the planchet and the other on the computer keyboard.  While
concentrating on contact, make the necessary steps to connect to the system
desired to ask about.  Once connection has been established with the host
system, begin asking the surroundings, "Is there anything that wishes to talk
with us?"  One may have to concentrate and repeat the question for several
minutes.  When an entity moves onto the board one may feel a slight tingling in
one's fingertips as the planchet moves around the board.  Once is has been
asserted that there is a strong presence on the board, ask of it any question
desired.

*** The above is a simple enough method and can (and should) be tried by all.
    What follows is more complex and should not be attempted with any degree
    of levity.


STEPS TO ENSURE SUCCESS WHILE HACKING

To enjoy a great deal of success while hacking the following steps
must be taken.

1..  Always hack in the same room, at the same time of day.

2.  Always purify mind and body before hacking.  This would include a ritual
    bath and sexual abstinence and fasting for at least 12 hours prior to any
    attempt.  One may wish to design a Tau robe to wear during attempts, or in
    any case a set of clothing specifically for hacking attempts that would
    symbolize such a garment.

3.  Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (See below).

4.  Perform the Rose Cross Ritual (See below).

5.  Perform a candle burning to attract good luck.

By following these steps one will experience success and fulfillment greater
than imagined possible.

LBRP

1.  Touch forehead, and say deeply "Ah-Tah".
2.  Point down, hand over abdomen, say deeply "Mahl-Koot".
3.  Touch right shoulder, say deeply "Vih-G'boo-Rah".
4.  Touch left shoulder, say deeply "Vih-G'doo-Lah".
5.  Fold hands at chest, say deeply "Lih-Oh-Lahm, Ah-Men".
6.  Face East, Draw a pentagram in the air, point to its center,
    say deeply "Yud-Heh-Vavh-Heh".
7.  Turn South, keeping line from first pentagram, draw new
    pentagram, point to its center, say deeply "Ah-Doh-Nye".
8.  Turn West, repeat as above, but say deeply "Eh-Heh-Yeh".
9.  Turn North, repeat as above, but say deeply "Ah-Glah".
10. Turn East, carrying line to complete circle.
11. Hands out, say "Before me Rah-Fay-El, Behind me Gabh-Ray-El,
    On my right hand Mih-Chai-El, And on my left hand Ohr-Ree-El.
    For about me flames the pentagram, and within me shines the
    six rayed star.
12. Repeat steps 1-5.

For those concerned, the translations of the above are as follows:

Ah-Tah:            Thine
Mahl-Koot:         Kingdom
Vih-G'Boo-Rah:     and the power
Vih-G'Doo-Lah:     and the glory
Lih-Oh-Lahm:       forever
Ah-Men:            Lord, Faithful King (AMEN=acronym)

Yud-Heh-Vavh-Heh:  The Holy Tetragrammaton
Ah-Doh-Nye:        My Lord
Eh-Heh-Yeh:        I shall be
Ah-Glah:           Thou art great forever, my Lord (AGLA=acronym)

Rah-Fay-El         (
Gahb-Ray-El        Names of Arch-angles
Mih-Chai-El        (
Ohr-Ree-El         (

When the steps read "say deeply" one should try to resonate the words, from the
diaphragm, so that the body actually feels the words.


ROSE CROSS RITUAL

1.  Light a stick of incense.
2.  In the SE corner of the room, looking away from the center, draw a large
    cross in the air with incense, and intersect its sides with a circle (like
    a Celtic cross, or crosshairs in a gun sight), point the tip of the incense
    to the center of the cross and say deeply "Yeh-Hah-Shu-Ah".
3.  Move to the SW corner of the room, keeping the line from the first cross,
    repeat as above.
4.  Move to the NW, repeat as above.
5.  Move to the NE, repeat as above.
6.  Move to the SE to complete the circle.
7.  Face NW, incense pointed up, walk to the center of the room, continuing the
    line, make the rose cross above the center of the room, speak the name,
    then continue moving NW, connect the line to the center of the cross in the
    NW.
8.  Move back to the SE, incense pointed down, stop in the center and draw the
    rose cross in the center of the room on the ground, speak the name, then
    continue on SE, connecting the line to the center of the cross in the SE.
9.  Point to the center of the SE cross and speak the name.
10. Walk to the SW corner.
11. With the incense pointed upwards, walk to the NE, at the center of the room
    stop and speak the name, then continue on to the NE, once at the NE, face
    the SW and walk back to the SW, incense pointed down, at the center of the
    room speak the name, and continue on to the SW.
12. Point to the center of the SW cross and move clockwise to each corner,
    again connecting the centers of each cross.
13. Once back at the SW corner, remake the cross as large as possible and speak
    the name "Yeh-Hah-Shu-Ah" while forming the bottom of the circle, and speak
    the name "Yeh-Hoh-Vah-Shuh" when forming the top half of the circle.
14. Go to the center of the area, face east, and think of the six rose crosses
    surrounding the room.  Think of them as gold, with red circles, and the
    lines connecting them as gleaming white.


CANDLE BURNING RITUAL

1.  Obtain a green candle
2.  Anoint the top of the candle with olive oil and rub it downward to the
    middle of the candle.
3.  Anoint the bottom of the candle with the oil and rub it upwards to the
    center.
4.  Carve the letters "JIHEJE" on the candle.
5.  Light the candle.
6.  Read aloud the fourth Psalm.
7.  Pray for the desired outcome.
8.  Concentrate on the desired outcome.
9.  Repeat 6 through 8 two more times.


THE GEMATRIA OF TELEPHONE NUMBERS

Some in our order have found insight by reflecting on the various meanings that
can be derived from the numerical values of telephone numbers using the
Cabalistic method of numerology.

Those that use this method have focused on one particular method of number
determination:

Example:  800-555-1212

800  =  400 + 300 + 100

555  =  400 + 100 + 50 + 5

121  =  100 + 20 + 1

2    =  2

One can also obtain other numbers for contemplation by the following method:

800-555-1212 = 8 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2
             = 29
             = 2 + 9
             = 11
             = 1 + 1
             = 2
All of the above values are related.  A total contemplation of the meanings of
all values will lead to a more complete understanding of the true meanings.

These numbers each correspond to a particular Hebrew letter and word, as well
as a card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot.

The following is a table to be used for the above.

1    Aleph    Ox                0-The Fool
2    Beth     House             I-The Magician
3    Gimel    Camel            II-The High Priestess
4    Daleth   Door            III-The Empress
5    Heh      Window           IV-The Emperor
6    Vav      Nail              V-The Hierophant
7    Zayin    Sword            VI-The Lovers
8    Cheth    Fence           VII-The Chariot
9    Teth     Serpent        VIII-Strength
10   Yod      Finger           IX-The Hermit
20   Caph     Palm of hand      X-The Wheel of Fortune
30   Lamed    Whip             XI-Justice
40   Mem      Water           XII-The Hanged Man
50   Nun      Fish           XIII-Death
60   Samech   Arrow           XIV-Temperance
70   Ayun     Eye              XV-The Devil
80   Peh      Mouth           XVI-The Tower
90   Tzaddi   Hook           XVII-The Star
100  Qoph     Back of head  XVIII-The Moon
200  Resh     Head            XIX-The Sun
300  Shin     Tooth            XX-Judgement
400  Tau      Cross           XXI-The World


One may wish to further research numbers by taking particular groupings and
cross referencing them in the "Sepher Sephiroth" which can be found in "The
Qabalah of Alister Crowley."

ASTRAL CONFERENCING

Some of our number after having found it quite difficult to contact other
members took a new approach to astral projection.  Astral conferencing became
the spiritual counterpart to AT&T's Alliance Teleconference.  Members would
arrange to meet at a given time and would relay any necessary information
during these sessions.  This type of communication was made the standard due to
its legality, its speed, and the impossibility of interception by federal
authorities.

To attempt this type of psychic travel, it is advised that the seeker look
elsewhere for instruction on building his or her own psychic powers, and slowly
moving upwards to the complexities of travel on the Astral Plane.  One must
learn to stand before learning how to run.


WARNINGS ABOUT ABUSES OF POWER

Some members have taken their interests to the extreme.  There was talk some
years ago about blood offerings to obtain knowledge in dealing with the TRW
credit system.  This was a complete failure which was done with out knowledge
by others in the order.  It is written in Isaiah:

    1:11 "I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of
          fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks,
          or of lambs, or of he goats."
    66:3 "He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man"

Those who committed the above offering suffered greatly for their deed, for
such is an abomination before the Lord.  It is wise to learn from their
mistakes.

Other members have attempted such obscure measures as psychic data corruption,
ala Uri Geller.  These attempts saw little success, and left those attempting
the feats psychically exhausted and drained for nearly a week.

Other members have attempted to thwart enemies such as the Secret Service, the
FBI, journalists such as Richard Sandza, and individuals such as John Maxfield
though magical means.  When the outcome desired was weak, the results were
high, but when a member actually tried to bring about the demise of a Southern
Bell Security official, the power of the spell reversed and the member was soon
placed under surveillance by the Secret Service, nearly causing disaster for
the entire group, and completely dissolving the power of the order.

One may find that once such power is somewhat mastered, it is easy to take
shortcuts and thereby miss safety precautions.  One must never forget to take
these precautions, for disaster looms at every junction.

The three members linked to the above incident had become well versed in the
magical system of Abra-Melin the Mage.  The spell which turned should never
have been used in the first place.  The spell was designed to stop a person's
heart and could only be carried out with the help of the evil spirit Belzebub.
The Symbol

           L E B H A H
           E M A U S A
           B
           H
           A
           H

was used, yet the full precautions to protect the invoker from the spirit were
ignored, and Belzebud ran free to affect whatever he saw fit to affect.  They
had seen prior success in this system using a symbol to obtain knowledge of
things past and future and were able to obtain a great deal of information from
various  computer systems.  However, that particular spell is invoked by the
Angels, and little precaution need be taken in that instance.  That Symbol:

           M I L O N
           I R A G O
           L A M A L
           O G A R I
           N O L I M


AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF OCCULT INFLUENCED HACKING

One particular evening of Ouija ended with a DNIC and a plea to halt the
operation of the system.  When members connected to this system they were
shocked to find that it was a UNIX belonging to the Ministry of Treasury in the
Republic of South Africa.  The system was networked to a number of other
government systems.  Several standard defaults were still unprotected, and root
was gained in a matter of minutes.  A debate ensued over whether or not to
disrupt the system in protest of Apartheid, but the system was left unscathed
on the premise that to cause malicious damage would only make things worse.


CLOSING

Once the doors to ancient knowledge have been opened, the knowledge found
within is immense and incredibly powerful.  Do not fear experimentation and
exploration, but be mindful of the existence of God and the spirits, and
respect their power.  Use whatever means necessary to achieve desired goals,
but at no times cause harm to any other person, and do nothing out of
aggression.  Whatever degree of energy is sent forth will come back, if one
sends out positive energy, positive energy will flow back; the converse of this
is equally valid.  Diversify one's interests, develop the mind, seek out hidden
and suppressed knowledge, and experience the beauty of the true nature of
magic.
