                               Introduction...
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Well, we have made it to this, the start of a new year and the start
of a new volume of Phrack Inc.  This has taken quite a while to get the long
awaited issue out, and it's been procrastinated quite a bit, so I apologize to
those that have been patiently waiting.  We have purposely waited a bit, but
we also are releasing this Phrack approximately at the same time as the Legion
of Doom/Hackers Technical Journal, which is another high quality newsletter
working with us rather than against us, and I personally recommend the
documents as highly informative.  I really enjoyed it and hope you continue to
support both of us.
        If you wish to write for Phrack Inc., merely get in touch with myself,
Knight Lightning, Cheap Shades or Beer Wolf or anyone that knows us or is on
any of the MSP boards and we shall either get back to you or get in contact
with you in some manner.  File topics can be either telecommunications or on
operating systems or some unique aspect/flaw of security.  Be looking forward
to more Phrack issues in the near and far future.  Later
-TK
