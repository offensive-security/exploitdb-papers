--[ 1 - Preface

    This article is intended for those who know the architecture of the 
Windows NT kernel and the principles of operation of NT drivers. This
article examines issues involved in the development of kernel-mode tools 
for stealthy remote administration of Windows NT.

    Recently there has been a tendency of extending the use of Windows NT
(2000, XP, 2003) from it's classical stronghold as home and 
office OS to servers. At the same time, the outdated Windows 9x family is 
replaced by the NT family. Because of this it should be evident that remote
administration tools (backdoors) and unnoticeable access tools (rootkits)
for the NT family have a certain value. Most of the published utilities 
work in user-mode and can thus be detected by Antivirus tools or by manual
inspection.

    It's quite another matter those works in kernel-mode: They can hide 
from any user-mode program. Antivirus software will have to suplly kernel-
mode components in order to detect a kernel-mode-backdoor. Software exists
that protects against such backdoors (such as IPD, "Integrity Protection
Driver"), but it's use is not widely spread. Kernel mode backdoors are not
as widely used as they could be due to their relative complexity in comp-
arison with user-mode backdoors.

--[ 2 - Overview of existing Kernel-Mode backdoors for Windows NT

    This section briefly reviews existing kernel-mode backdoors for Windows
    NT.
    
----[ 2.1 - Ntrootkit
    
    Ntrootkit (c) by Greg Hoglund and a team of free developers [1] is a 
device driver for Windows NT 4.0 and 2000. It's possibilities (implemented
and potential):

 - Receiving commands from a remote client. The rk_packet module contains
   a simplified IP-stack, which uses free IP-address from the subnet where
   the host on which Ntrootkit has been installed is situated.

   It's MAC and IP addresses are hardcoded in the source. Connection with 
   the rootkit at that IP is carried out via a TCP connection to any port. 
   The available commands in rk_command.c are:

       ps - list processes
       help - self explainatory
       buffertest, echo and debugint - for debugging purpose
       hidedir - hide directory/file
       hideproc - hide process(es)
       sniffkeys - keyboard spy

   There are also imcomplete pieces of code: Execute commands received via
   a covert channel and starting a Win32-process from a driver (a hard and
   complicated task).

 - Encrypt all traffic using Schneier's Blowfish algorithm:
   rk_blowfish.c is present, but not (yet ?) used

 - Self-defense (rk_defense.c) - hide protected objects (in this
   case: registry keys), identified by the string "_root_"; redirect
   launched processes.

   The hiding of processes, directories and files as implemented in 
   rk_ioman.c is done through hooking the following functions: 
   
       NtCreateFile
       ZwOpenFile
       ZwQueryDirectoryFile
       ZwOpenKey
       ZwQueryKey
       ZwQueryValueKey
       ZwEnumerateValueKey
       ZwEnumerateKey
       ZwSetValueKey
       ZwCreateKey

   The way to detect this rootkit:

   Make direct request to filesystem driver, send IRP to it. There is
   one more module that hooks file handling: rk_files.c, adopted from
   filemon, but it is not used.

 - Starting processes: An unfinished implementation of it can be found
   in rk_command.c, another one (which is almost complete and good) is 
   in rk_exec.c

   The implementation suffers from the fact that Zw* functions which are
   normally unavailable to drivers directly are called through the system
   call interface (int 0x2E), leading to problems with different versions
   of the NT family as system call numbers change.

    It seems like the work on Ntrootkit is very loosely coordinated: every
    developer does what (s)he considers needed or urgent. Ntrootkit does 
    not achieve complete (or sufficient) invisibility. It creates device 
    named "Ntroot", visible from User-Mode.

    When using Ntrootkit for anything practical, one will need some means
of interaction with the rootkitted system. Shortly: There will be the
need for some sort of shell. Ntrootkit itself can not give out a shell
directly, although it can start a process -- the downside is that the
I/O of that process can not be redirected. One is thus forced to start
something like netcat. It's process can be hidden, but it's TCP-connection
will be visible. The missing redirection of I/O is a big drawback.
    
    However, Ntrootkit development is still in progress, and it will 
probably become a fully-functional tool for complete and stealthy remote 
administration.

----[ 2.2 - He4Hook

    This description is based on [2]. The filesystem access was hooked via
two different methods in the versions up to and including 2.15b6. Only one
of it works at one time, and in versions after 2.15b6 the first method was
removed.

Method A: hook kernel syscalls:
===============================

ZwCreateFile, ZwOpenFile      - driver version 1.12 and from 1.17 to 
                                2.15beta6
IoCreateFile                  - from 1.13 to 2.15beta6
ZwQueryDirectoryFile, ZwClose - before 2.15beta6

Almost all these exported functions (Zw*) have the following function
body:
  mov eax, NumberFunction
  lea edx, [esp+04h]
  int 2eh                       ; Syscall interface

    The "NumberFunction" is the number of the called function in the 
syscalls table (which itself can be accessed via the global variable
KeServiceDescriptorTable). This variable points to following structure:

typedef struct SystemServiceDescriptorTable
  {
    SSD  SystemServiceDescriptors[4];
  } SSDT, *LPSSDT;

Other structures:

typedef VOID *SSTAT[];
typedef unsigned char SSTPT[];
typedef SSTAT *LPSSTAT;
typedef SSTPT *LPSSTPT;

typedef struct SystemServiceDescriptor
  {
    LPSSTAT lpSystemServiceTableAddressTable;
    ULONG  dwFirstServiceIndex;
    ULONG  dwSystemServiceTableNumEntries;
    LPSSTPT lpSystemServiceTableParameterTable;
  } SSD, *LPSSD;

The DescriptorTable pointed to by KeServiceDescriptorTable is only
accessible from kernel mode. In User-Mode, there is something called
KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow -- unfortunately it is not exported.

Base services are in

 KeServiceDescriptorTable->SystemServiceDescriptors[0]
 KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow->SystemServiceDescriptors[0]

KernelMode GUI services are in
 KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow->SystemServiceDescriptors[1]

    Other elements of that tables were free at moment when [2] was
written, in all versions up to WinNt4(SP3-6) and Win2k build 2195.
Each element of the table is a SSID structure, which contains the 
following data:

lpSystemServiceTableAddressTable   - A pointer to an array of addresses
                                     of functions that will be called if
                                     a matching syscall is called
                                     
dwFirstServiceIndex                - Start index for the first function

dwSystemServiceTableNumEntries     - Number of services in table

lpSystemServiceTableParameterTable - An array of bytes specifying the
                                     number of bytes from the stack that
                                     will be passed through

In order to hook a system call, He4HookInv replaces the address stored in
KeServiceDescriptorTable->SystemServiceDescriptos[0].lpSystemServiceTableAddressTableIn
with a pointer to it's own table.

One can interface with He4HookInv by adding your own services to the
system call tables. He4HookInv updates both tables:

- KeServiceDescriptorTable
- KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow.

Otherwise, if it updated only KeServiceDescriptorTable, new services 
would be unavailable from UserMode. To locate KeServiceDescriptorTable-
Shadow the following technique is used:

    The function KeAddSystemServiceTable can be used to add services to the
kernel. It can add services to both tables. Taking into account that its
0-th descriptor is identical, it's possible, by scanning
KeAddSystemServiceTable function's code, to find the address of the shadow
table. You can see how it is done in file He4HookInv.c, function 
FindShadowTable(void).

    If this method fails for some reason, a hardcoded address is taken
(KeServiceDescriptorTable-0x230) as location of the shadow table. This 
address has not changed since WinNT Sp3. Another problem is the search
for the correct index into the function address array. As almost all Zw*
functions have an identical first instruction (mov eax, NumberFunction),
one can get a pointer to the function number easily by adding one byte
to the address exported by ntoskrnl.exe

Method B: (for driver versions 2.11 and higher)
===============================================

    The callback tables located in the DRIVER_OBJECT of the file system
drivers are patched: The IRP handlers of the needed drivers are replaced.
This includes replacing the pointers to base function handlers 
(DRIVER_OBJECT->MajorFunction) as well as replacing pointers to the
drivers unload procedure (DRIVER_OBJECT->DriverUnload).

The following functions are handled:

IRP_MJ_CREATE
IRP_MJ_CREATE_NAMED_PIPE
IRP_MJ_CREATE_MAILSLOT
IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL -> IRP_MN_QUERY_DIRECTORY

For a more detailed description of the redirection of file operations
refer to the source [2].

----[ 2.3 - Slanret (IERK, Backdoor-ALI)

    The source code for this is unavailable -- it was originally disco-
vered by some administrator on his network. It is a normal driver 
("ierk8243.sys") which periodically causes BSODs, and is visible as a
service called "Virtual Memory Manager".

        "Slanret is technically just one component of a
         root kit. It comes with a straightforward backdoor
         program: a 27 kilobyte server called "Krei" that
         listens on an open port and grants the hacker remote
         access to the system. The Slanret component is a
         seven kilobyte cloaking routine that burrows into the
         system as a device driver, then accepts commands from
         the server instructing it on what files or processes
         to conceal." [3]

----[ 3. Stealth on disk, in registry and in memory

    The lower the I/O interception in a rootkit is performed, the harder
it usually is to detect it's presence. One would think that a reliable 
place for interception would be the low-level disk operations (read/write
sectors). This would require handling all filesystems that might be on 
the hard disk though: FAT16, FAT32, NTFS.

    While FAT was relatively easy to deal with (and some old DOS stealth
viruses used similar techniques) an implementation of something similar
on WinNT is a task for maniacs.

    A second place to hook would be hooking dispatch functions of file-
system drivers: Patch DriverObject->MajorFunction and FastIoDispatch in
memory or patch the drivers on disk. This has the advantage of being re-
latively universal and is the method used in HE4HookInv.

    A third possibility is setting a filter on a filesyste driver (FSD).
This has no advantages in comparison with the previous method, but has 
the drawback of being more visible (Filemon uses this approach). The
functions Zw*, Io* can then be hooked either by manipulating the Ke-
ServiceDescriptorTable or directly patching the function body. It is
usually quite easy to detect that pointers in KeServiceDescriptorTable
point to strange locations or that the function body of a function has
changed. A filter driver is also easy to detect by calling IoGetDevice-
ObjectPointer and then checking DEVICE_OBJECT->StackSize.

    All normal drivers have their own keys in the registry, namely in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.

    The abovementioned rootkits can hide registry keys, but obviously,
if the system is booted "cleanly", an administrator can see anything that
was hidden. One can also load a rootkit using ZwSetSystemInformation(
SystemLoadAndCallimage) without the need to create any registry keys. An
example of this technique can be found in [6].

    A rootkit loader in a separate file is too unstealthy. It might be a
smarter move to patch that call into some executable file which is part of
the system boot. One can use any driver or user-mode program that works 
with sufficient privileges, or any DLL linked to by it. One has to ask one
question though: If the newly introduced changes need to be hidden anyway,
why make two similar but differing procedures (for hiding changes to a
file as well as hiding the existance of a file) instead of limiting our-
selves to one ?

    In most cases one can target null.sys. Implementing it's functionality
is as easy as "hello world", and that is why it is usually replaced with a 
trojan. But if we are going to have a procedure for hiding changes to a
file, we can replace ANY driver with a trojan that will substitute the 
content of the replaced file with the original content to everyone (incl-
uding the kernel). Upon startup, it will copy itself to some allocated 
memory area and start a thread there. 

    This will make the trojan almost unnoticeable in memory: No system 
utility can see the driver any more, as it is just an anonymous memory
page amongst many. We do not even need a thread, using intercepted IRP 
dispatch functions of some driver (DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_xxx]).
We can also use IoQueueWorkItem and KeInsertQueueDpc, so no additional
threads in SYSTEM will be visible in the task manager. After this is done
the trojan can unload the driver it was started from, and reload it in a
clean (unchanged) variant. As a result, high levels of stealth will be 
achieved by relatively simple means. The original content of the manipu-
lated file could for example be stored in the trojan's file after the
trojan itself.

    It will then be sufficient to hook all FSD requests (IRP and FastIO)
and upon access change the position (and size of the file).

--[ 4 - My variant: The thorny path

----[ 4.1 - Shell

    I originally intended to do something similarily simple as standard
user-mode code: Just pass a socket handle for stdin/stdout/stderr to the
newly created cmd.exe process. I did not find a way to open a useful 
socket from a driver though, as the interface with the AFD driver (kmode
core of winsock) is undocumented. Reverse-engineering it's usage was not
an option either as due to changes between versions my technique would be
unreliable. I had to find a different way.

First variant
=============

    We could start our code in the context of some process, using a shell-
code quite similar to that used in exploits. The code could wait for a TCP
connection and start cmd.exe with redirected I/O.

    I chose this way when I tired of trying to start a full-fledged win32
process from a driver. The shellcode is position-independent, searches for
kernel32.dll in memory and loads the winsock library. All that needs to be
done is injecting the shellcode into the address space of a process and 
pass control to the entry point of the shellcode. However, in the process
of doing this the normal work of the process must not be interrupted, be-
cause a failure in a critical system process will lead to a failure of the
whole system.

    So we need to allocate memory, write shellcode there, and create a
thread with EIP = entry point of the shellcode. Code to do this can be 
found in the attached file shell.cpp. Unfortunately, when CreateProcess
is called from the thread started in this way it failed, most probably 
because something that CreateProcess relies upon was not initialized pro-
poerly in the context of our thread. We thus need to call CreateProcess
from a thread context which has everything that CreateProcess needs ini-
tialized -- we're going to take a thread which belongs to the process we
are intruding into (I used SetThreadContext for that). One needs to re-
store the state of the thread prior to the interruption so it can contiue
it's normal operation.

    So we need to: Save thread context via GetThreadContext, set the EIP 
to our context via SetThreadContext, wait for the code to complete, and
then restore the original cont again. The rest is just a usual shellcode 
for Windows NT (full code in dummy4.asm).

    One unsolved problem remains: If the thread is in waiting state, it 
will not run until it wakes up. Using ZwAlertThread does not yield any re-
sult if the thread is in a nonalertable wait state. Fortunately, the 
thread in services.exe worked without a problem -- this does not imply it
will stay like this in the future though, so I continued my research:

Second variant
==============

    Things are not as easy as [4] makes them sound. Creating a full-
fledged win32-process requires it's registration in the CSRSS subsystem.
This is accomplished by using CsrClientCallServer(), which receives all
necessary information about the process (handles, TID, PID, flags). The
functions calls ZwRequestWaitReplyPort, which receives a handle of a pre-
viously opened port for connection with CSRSS.

    This port is not open in the SYSTEM process context. Opening it never
succeeded (ZwConnectPort returned STATUS_PORT_CONNECTION_REFUSED). Play-
ing with SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE didn't help. While disassembling
ntdll.dll I saw that ZwConnectPort calls were preceded by ZwCreateSection.
But there was no time and no desire to play with sections. Here is the
code that didn't work:

VOID InformCsrss(HANDLE hProcess,HANDLE hThread,ULONG pid,ULONG tid)
{
        CSRMSG                        csrmsg;
        HANDLE                        hCurProcess;
        HANDLE                        handleIndex;
        PVOID                        p;

        _asm int 3;

        UNICODE_STRING                PortName;
        RtlInitUnicodeString(&PortName,L"\\Windows\\ApiPort");
        static  SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE QoS =
                {sizeof(QoS), SecurityAnonymous, 0, 0};
        /*static  SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE QoS =
                {0x77DC0260,
                (_SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL)2, 0x120101, 0x10000};*/
        DWORD ret=ZwConnectPort(&handleIndex,&PortName,&QoS,NULL,
                                NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
                
        if (!ret) {
                RtlZeroMemory(&csrmsg,sizeof(CSRMSG));
                
                csrmsg.ProcessInformation.hProcess=hProcess;
                csrmsg.ProcessInformation.hThread=hThread;
                csrmsg.ProcessInformation.dwProcessId=pid;
                csrmsg.ProcessInformation.dwThreadId=tid;
                
                csrmsg.PortMessage.MessageSize=0x4c;
                csrmsg.PortMessage.DataSize=0x34;
                
                csrmsg.CsrssMessage.Opcode=0x10000;
                
        
        ZwRequestWaitReplyPort(handleIndex,(PORT_MESSAGE*)&csrmsg,
                                            (PORT_MESSAGE*)&csrmsg);
        }
}

    The solution to the problem was obvious; Switch context to one in
which the port is open, e.g. to the context of any win32-process. I inser-
ted KeAttachProcess(HelperProcess) before calling Nebbet's InformCsrss,
and KeDetachProcess afterwards. The role of the HelperProcess was taken
by calc.exe.

    When I tried using KeAttachProcess that way I failed though: The con-
text was switched (visible using the proc command in SoftICE), but Csr-
ClientCallServer returned STATUS_ILLEGAL_FUNCTION. Only Uncle Bill knows
what was happening inside CSRSS.
    
    When trying to frame the whole process creation function into
KeAttachProcess/KeDetachProcess led to the following error when calling
ZwCreateProcess: "Break Due to KeBugCheckEx (Unhandled kernel mode
exception) Error=5 (INVALID_PROCESS_ATTACH_ATTEMPT) ... ".

    A different way to execute my code in the context of an arbitrary
process is APC. The APC may be kmode or user-mode. As long as only kmode
APC may overcome nonalertable wait state, all code for process creation
must be done in kernel mode. Nebbet's code normally works at 
  IRQL == APC_LEVEL
Code execution in the context of a given win32-process by means of APC is
implemented in the StartShell() function, in file ShellAPC.cpp.
    
Interaction with the process
=============================

    Starting a process isn't all. The Backdoor still needs to communicate
with it: It is necessary to redirect it's stdin/stdout/stderr to our 
driver. We could do this like most "driver+app"-systems: Create a device
that is visible from user-mode, open it using ZwOpenFile and pass the
handle to the starting process (stdin/stdout/stderr). But a named device
is not stealthy, even if we automatically create a random names. This is
why I have chosen to use named pipes instead.
     
    Windows NT uses named pipes with names like Win32Pipes.%08x.%08x (here
%08x is random 8-digit numbers) for emulation of anonymous pipes. If we 
create one more such pipe, nobody will notice. Usually, one uses 2 anon-
ymous pipes r redirecting I/O of a console application in Win32, but when
using a named pipe one will be sufficient as it is bi-directional. The 
driver must create a bi-directional named pipe, and cmd.exe must use it's
handle as stdin/stdout/stderr.

    The handle can be opened in both kmode and user-mode. The final ver-
sion uses the first variant, but I have also experimented with the second
variant -- being able to implement different variants may help evade anti-
viruses. Starting a process with redirected I/O has been completely imple-
mented in kernel mode in the file NebbetCreateProcess.cpp.

    There are two main differences between my and Nebbet's code: The fun-
ctions that are not exported from ntoskrnl.exe but from ntdll, are dyn-
amically imported (see NtdllDynamicLoader.cpp). The handle to the named
pipe is opened with ZwOpenFile() and passed to the starting process with
ZwDuplicateObject with DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE flag.

    For opening the named pipe from user mode I inject code into a start-
ing process. I attached the patch (NebbetCreateProcess.diff) for edu-
cational purposes. It adds a code snippet to a starting process. The 
patch writes code (generated by a C++ compiler) to a process's stack. For
independence that code is a function which accepts a pointer to a struc-
ture containing all the necessary data (API addresses etc) as parameter.
This structure and a pointer to it are written to the stack together with
the code of the function itself. ESP of the starting thread is set 4 bytes
bellow the pointer to the parameters of the function, and EIP to it's en-
try point. Once the injected code is done executing, it issues a CALL back
to the original entry point. This example can be modified to be yet 
another way of injecting code into a working userland process from kernel
mode.

---[ 4.2 - Activation and communication with the remote client

    If a listening socket is permanently open (and visible to netstat -an)
it is likely to be discovered. Even if one hides the socket from netstat
is insufficient as a simple portscan could uncover the port. To remain 
stealthy a backdoor must not have any open ports visible locally or re-
motely. It is necessary to use a special packet, which on the one hand
must be unambigously identified by the backdoor as activation signal, yet
at the same time must not be so suspicious as to trigger alerts or be fil-
tered by firewalls. The activation signal could e.g. be a packet contain-
ing a set of packets at any place (header or data) -- all characteristics
of the packet (protocol, port etc) should be ignored. This allows for max-
imum flexibility to avoid aggressive packet filters.

    Obviously, we have to implement some sort of sniffer in order to 
detect such a special packet. In practice, we have several choices on how
to implement the sniffer:

1) NDIS protocol driver (advantage: possibility not only to receive
   packets, but also to send - thus making covert channel for
   communication with remote client possible; disadvantage: difficulties 
   with supporting all types of network devices) - applied in ntrootkit;

2) use service provided by IpFilterDriver on w2k and higher
   (advantages: simple implementation and complete independence
   from physical layer; disadvantage: receive only);

3) setup filter on 1 of network drivers, through which packets pass
   through (see [5]);

4) direct appeal to network drivers by some other means for receive
   and send packets (advantage: can do everything; disadvantage:
   unexplored area).

    I have chosen variant 2 due to it's simplicity and convenience for both
described variants of starting a shell. IpFilterDriver used only for
activation, further connection is made via TCP by means of TDI.

    An example of the usage of IpFilterDriver can be seen in Filtering.cpp
and MPFD_main.cpp. InitFiltering() loads the IpFilterDriver if it isn't 
yet loaded. Then it calls SetupFiltering, which sets a filter with 
IOCTL_PF_SET_EXTENSION_POINTER IOCTL. PacketFilter() is then called on 
each IP packet. If a keyword is detected StartShellEvent is set and causes
a shell to be started.

    The variant using shellcode in an existing process works with the
network in user-mode, thus we do not need to describe anything in detail.
    
    A Kernel-mode TCP shell is implemented in NtBackd00r.cpp. When cmd.exe
is started from a driver with redirected I/O, the link is maintained by 
the driver. I took the tcpecho example as base for the communitcation mod-
ule in order not to waste time coding a TDI-client from scratch. 
DriverEntry() initialises TDI, creates a listening socket and an unnamed 
device for IoQueueWorkItem.

    For each conenction an instance of the Session class is created. In
it's OnConnect handler a sequence of operations for creating a process.
process. As long as this handler is called at IRQL==DISPATCH_LEVEL, it's
impossible to do all necessary operations directly in it. It's even
impossible to start a thread because PsCreateSystemThread must be called
only at PASSIVE_LEVEL according to the DDK. Therefore the OnConnect 
handler calls IoAllocateWorkItem and IoQueueWorkItem in order to do any
further operations accomplished in WorkItem handler (ShellStarter 
function) at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

    ShellStarter calls StartShell() and creates a worker thread
(DataPumpThread) and 2 events for notifying it about arriving packets and
named pipe I/O completion. Interaction between the WorkItem/thread and 
Session class was built with taking a possible sudden disconnect and
freeing Session into account: syncronisation is accomplished by disabling
interrupts (it's equivalent of raise IRQL to highest) and by means of 
DriverStudio classes (SpinLock inside). The Thread uses a copy of some 
data that must be available even after instance of Session was deleted.

    Initially, DataPumpThread starts one asynchronous read operation 
(ZwReadFile) from named pipe -- event hPipeEvents[1] notifies about it's
completion. The other event hPipeEvents[0] notifies about data arrival 
from the network. After that ZwWaitForMultipleObjects executed in a loop 
waits for one of these events. In dependence of what event was signaled, 
the thread does a read from the named pipe and sends data to client, or 
does a read read from FIFO and writes to pipe. If the Terminating flag 
is set, thread closes all handles, terminates the cmd.exe process, and 
then terminates itself. Data arrival is signaled by the hPipeEvents[0] 
event in Session::OnReceive and Session::OnReceiveComplete handlers. 
It also used in conjunction with the Terminating flag to notify the thread
about termination.

    Data resceived from the network is buffered in pWBytePipe FIFO. 
DataPumpThread reads data from the FIFO to temporary buffers which are 
allocated for each I/O operation and writes data asynchronously to the
pipe (ZwWriteFile). The buffers are freed asynchronously in the ApcCallback-
WriteComplete handler.

    Data transfers from the pipe to the network are also accomplished through
temporary buffers that are allocated before ZwReadFile and freed in
Session::OnSendComplete.

Paths of data streams and temporary buffers handling algorithm:

NamedPipe -(new send_buf; ZwReadFile)-> temporary buffer

send_buf -(send)-> Network -> OnSendComplete{delete send_buf}

Network -(OnReceive)-> pWBytePipe -(new rcv_buf)-> temporary

buffer rcv_buf -(ZwWriteFile)-> NamedPipe ->
                                ApcCallbackWriteComplete{delete rcv_buf}

    In Session::OnReceive handler data is written to the FIFO and the 
DataPumpThread is notified about it's arrival. If the transport has more
data available than indicated another buffer is allocated to read the
rest. When the transport is done - asynchronously - OnReceiveComplete()
handler is called, which does the same as OnReceive.

----[ 4.3 - Stealth on disk

    I've implemented simple demo module (file Intercept.cpp) which hooks
dispatch functions of a given filesystem diver to hide the first N bytes of
a given file. To hook FSD call e.g. Intercept(L"\\FileSystem\\Fastfat").
There is only 2 FSDs that may be necessary to hook: Fastfat ant Ntfs,
because NT can boot from these filesystems.

    Intercept() replaces some driver dispatch functions
(pDriverObject->MajorFunction[...], pDriverObject->FastIoDispatch->...).

    When hooked driver handles IRPs and FastIo calls the corresponding hook
functions modifies file size and current file offset. Thus all user-mode
programs see file N bytes smaller than original, containing bytes N to
last. It allows to implement trick described in part 3.

--[ 5 - Conclusion

    In this article I compared 3 existing Kernel-Mode backdoors for
Windows NT from a programmers point of view, presented some ideas on making
a backdoor stealthier as well as my thorny path of writing my own Kernel-
Mode backdoor.

    What we did not describe was a method of hiding open sockets and TCP
connections from utilities such as netstat and fport. Netstat uses 
SnmpUtilOidCpy(), and fport talks directly with drivers
(\Device\Udp and \Device\Tcp). To hide something from these and all
similar tools, it's necessary to hook aforementioned drivers with one of
methods mentioned in section "Stealth on disk, in registry and in
memory". I did not explore that issue yet. Probably, its consideration
deserves a separate article. Advice for those who decided to move this
direction: begin with the study of IpLog sources [5].

(probably improved and supplemented), its Russian original, and full code
