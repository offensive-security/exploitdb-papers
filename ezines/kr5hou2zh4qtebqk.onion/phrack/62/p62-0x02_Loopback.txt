Subject: Very important send to editor in chief asap

I should start off buy saying I'm not a cop fed or any other kind of law en
forcement nor am i affiliated with any national local government of any kind
to be honest i don't exist anywhere but, i am not a fan nor friend either.
[ ... ] I however have the knowledge you seek but unlike you i will not
freely share the knowledge with just every one. you must deserve to know.
you must prove yourself. [ ... ] now email is not safe but I've taken the
precautions on my end to keep this message out of government hands i hope
your server is secure if not they will be looking for me of course they are
always looking for me. [ ... ] if you don't succeed which you probably wont
don't worry thousands before you have failed and thousands will after it
just makes you average.

p.s. IF THE MESSAGE IS INTERCEPTED BY ANY TYPE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT the
recipients do not know who i am and questioning them would be like
searching google.

A friend referred me to your site.  I know nothing much about what is
posted.  I don't understand what's what.

    [ This is loopback. ]

Apparently there is some basic info that should be known to understand,
but what is it?
