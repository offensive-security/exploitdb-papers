--[ 1.0 - Abstract

    PD  is  a proof  of  concept  tool being  released  to  help rebuilding
or recovering a binary file from  a running process, even if the file never
existed in  the disk.  Computer Forensics,  reverse engineering, intruders,
administrators, software protection, all share the same piece of the puzzle
in a computer. Even if the  intentions are quite different, get or hide the
real  (clean)  code,  everything  revolves  around it:  binary  code  files
(executable) and running process.

    Manipulation of  a  running application  using  code injection,  hiding
using ciphers  or  binary packers are some of the  current ways to hide the
code  being executed  from  inspectors,  as executed code is different than
stored in disk. The  last days  a new  anti forensics method  published  in
phrack  62  (Volume 0x0b,  Issue 0x3e,  phile  0x08  by  grugq)  showed  an
"user landexec module". ulexec allows the execution of a binary sent by the
network from another  host without  writing  the file  to  disk, hiding any
clue  to forensics  analysts.  The  main  intention of  this  article is to
show  a process to  success in the  recovering or rebuilding  a binary file
from a running process, and PD is a sample implementation for that process.
Tests includes  injected  code,  burneyed  file  and  the  most  exotic  of
all, rebuilding a  file executed using  grugq's "userland remote exec" that
was never saved in disk.


--[ 2.0 - Introduction

    An executable contains the data the system needs to run the application
contained  in the  file.   Some of  the data  stored  in the  file is  just
information the  system should consider before  launching, and requirements
needed by the  application binary code.  Running an  executable is a kernel
process that grabs that information from the file, sets up the needings for
that program and launches it.

However,  although  a binary file  contains  the data  needed to  launch  a
process and the program itself, there's no reason to trust that program has
not  been  modified  during execution.  One  common task  to avoid host IDS
detecting binary manipulation  is  to modify  a running process  instead of
binary stored files.  A process may be running some kind of troyan injected
code until system restart, when original program will be executed again.

In selfmodifing,  ciphered or compressed applications, program code in disk
may differ from program code in memory due to  'by design' functionality of
the file.  It's  a common task to avoid reverse engineering  and scope goes
from virus to  commercial software.  Once the program is ran,  it deciphers
itself remaining clean in memory content  of the process  until the end  of
execution.  However,  any attempt to see the program contained in the file
will require a great effort  due to complexity of the implemented cipher or
obfuscation mechanism.

In other hand,  there's no reason to keep the binary  file once the process
is started (for  example a troyan installer).  Many  forensics methods rely
their investigation in disk  MAC (modify, create, access) timeline analysis
after  powering down  the system,  and that's  the main  reason  when grugq
talked about user  land remote exec: there's no need to  write data in disk
if you  can forge  the system to  run a  memory portion emulating  a kernel
loader. This kind  of data contraception may drop any  attempt to create an
activity timeline due to the missing information: the files an intruder may
install in  the system.  Without  traces, any further  investigation would
not reveal attacker information. That's the description of the "remote exec
attack", defeated later in this paper. 

All those scenarios presented are real, and in all of them memory system of
the suspicious  process should be  analyzed, however there's  no mechanism
allowing  this  operation. There  are  several  tools  to dump  the  memory
content,   but,  in   a  "human   unreadable  -   system   unreadable"  raw
format.  Analysis tools  may need  an executable formatted file,  and  also
human analyst   may  need   a binary file   being launched  in  a  testing 
environment (aka laboratory). Raw code,  or dumped  memory  code is  useful
if  execution environment  is known,  but sometimes  untraceable.  Here  is
where  pd  (as  concept)  may help  in the  analysis process,  rebuilding a
working executable file from the  process, allowing researchers  to  launch
when and where they need, and capable of being analyzed at any time in any 
system. 

Rebuilding a binary  file from a memory process allow us  to recover a file
modified in run time or deciphered, and also recover if it's being executed
but never  was saved in the  system (as the remote  executed using ulexec),
preventing  from  data contraception  and  information  missing in  further
analysis. 

This paper  will describe  the process of  rebuilding an executable  from a
process in  memory, showing each  involved data in  every step. One  of the
main goals  of the article  is to realize  where the recovering  process is
vulnerable  to manipulation.   Knowing our  limits  is our  best effort  to
develop a better process. 

There  are  several  posts  in  internet  related  to  code  injection  and
obfuscation.   For  userland remote  execution  trick  refer  to phrack  62
(Volume 0x0b, Issue 0x3e, phile 0x08 by grugq)


--[ 3.0 - Principles

    Until this  year the most hiding  method  used for code  (malicious  or
not) hiding was  the  packing/cyphering one.  During  execution  time,  the
original code/file   should  be   rebuilt  in   disk,  in memory, or  where
the  unpacker/uncypher should need.  The disk file still  remains  ciphered
hiding it's content. 

To avoid disk  data written and Host IDS detection,  several ways are being
used until now. Injecting binary code  right in a running process is one of
them.  In a  forensics analysis some checks to  the original file signature
(or   MD5,   or  whatever)   my   fail,   warning   about  binary   content
manipulation. If this code only resides in memory, the disk scan will never
show its presence. 

"Userland Remote Exec" is  a new kind of attack, as a  way to execute files
downloaded from a  remote host without write them to  disk.  The main idea
goes  through an  implementation  of a  kernel  loader, and  a remote  file
transfer core. When "ul_remote_exec" program receives a binary file it sets
up as  much information and  estructures as needed  to fork or  replace the
existing  code  with the  downloaded  one, and  give  control  to this  new
process.   It  safes  new   program  memory  pages,  setting  up  execution
environment, and loading code and  data into the correct sections, the same
way the system kernel does. The main difference is that system loads a file
from disk, and UserLand Remote  Exec (down)"loads" a file from the network,
ensuring no data is written in the disk. 

With all these methods we have a running process with different binary data
than saved in the disk (if existing there).  Different scenarios that could
be resolved  with one technique: an interface allowing us to dump a process
and  rebuild a  binary  file that  when  executed will  recreate this  same
process. 


--[ 4.0 - Background

    Under Windows architecture  there're a  lot of useful  tools  providing
this functionality in   user space. "procdump"  is  the name of  a  generic
process dumper for this  operating  system,  although  there're  many  more
tools including application specific un-packers and dumpers. 

Under linux (*nix for x86 systems, the scope of this paper) several studies
attempt  to  help analyzing  the  memory  (ie:  Zalewski's memfetch)  of  a
process.  Kernel/system memory may give other useful information about any
of the process being executed  (Wietse's memfetch).  Also, gdb now includes
dumping feature, allowing the dump of memory blocks to disk. 

There's  an  interesting  tool  comparing  a  process  and  a  binary  file
(www.hick.org's  elfcmp). Although  I  discovered later  in  the study,  it
didn't work for me. Anyway, it's an interesting topic in this article. 
Recover a binary from a core dump is an easy task due to the implementation
of the  core functionality. Silvio Cesare  stated that in  a complete paper
(see references). 

There's also a kernel module for recover a burneyed binary from memory once
it's deciphered,  but in any case  it cares about binary  analysis. It just
dumps a memory  region where burneye engine writes  dechypered data before
executing. 

All these approximations will not finish the process of recovering a binary
file,  but they  will give  valuable information  and ideas  about  how the
process should/would/could be. 

The  program   included  here  is   an  example  of  defeating   all  these
anti-forensics  methods, attaching  to  a pid,  analyzing  it's memory  and
rebuilding a binary image allowing us to recover the process data and code,
and also  re-execute  it in  a testing environment.  It  summarizes all the
above  functionality   in an  attempt  to  create  a  rebuilding   working 
interface. 


--[ 5.0 - Requirements

    In  an initial  approach  I  fall into  a  lot of  presumptions  due to
the technology involved in the testing  environment. Linux  and  x86 32bits
intel architecture was the  selected platform with kernel 2.4*.   There was
a lot of analysis performed  in that platform  assuming some  of the kernel
constants and specifications  removed  or  modified later.   Also, GCC  was
the selected  compiler for the  binaries tested,  so instead of a  generic 
ELF format, the gcc elf implementation  has been the referral  most of the 
time. 

After some investigation it was realized that all these presumptions should
be removed from the code for compatibility in other test systems. Also, GCC
was left apart in some cases, analyzing files programmed in asm. 

The /proc filesystem  was first removed from analysis,  returning bak after
some  further investigation.  /proc  filesystem is  a useful  resource for
information gathering  about a  process from user  space (indeed,  it's the
user space kernel interface for process information queries). 

The concept of process dumping (sample code also) is very system dependant,
as  kernel  and  customs loaders  may leave  memory in  different  states, 
so there's no  a generic program ready-to-use  that could rebuild  any kind
of executable with total  guaranties of use.  A program may  evolve in  run
time loading some  code from a inspected  source, or delete the  used  code
while being executed. 

Also,  it's very  important to  realize  that even  if a  binary format  is
standardized,  every file  is built  under compiler  implementation, so the
information included in it may help or difficult the restoring process. 

In this paper  there are several user interfaces to access  the memory of a
process,  but the cheapest  one has  been selected:  ptrace.  From  now on,
ptrace should  be a requirement  in the implementation  of PD, as  no other
method to read process memory space has been included in the POC. 

In order to  reproduce the tests, a linux kernel  2.4 without any security
patch  (like grsecurity,  pax, or  other  ptrace and  stack protection)  is
recommended, as well as gcc compiled binaries. Ptrace should be enabled and
/proc filesystem would be useful.  grugq remote exec and burneyed had been
successfully compiled in this environment,  so all the toolset for the test
will be working. 

Files dynamically linked to system libraries become system dependant if the
dynamic  information  is  not  restored  to it's  original  state.   PD  is
programmed  to restore  the dynamic  subsystem  (plt) of  any gcc  compiled
binary, so gcc+ldd dynamic linked files  would be restored to work in other
host correctly. 


--[ 6.0 - Design and Implementation

    Some common tasks   had been  identified to  success in the   dump of a
process in  a generic  way.  The   design should  heavily rely  in   system
dependant interfaces  for each  one,  so an exhaustive analysis  should  be
performed in them:

 1- Get information of a process
 2- Get binary data of that process from memory
 3- Order/clean and safe binary data in a file
 4- Build an ELF header for the file to be correctly loaded
 5- Adjust binary information

Also, there's a  previous step to resolve before doing  any of the previous
tasks, it's, to get communication  with that process.  We need an interface
to read all  this information from the system memory  space and process it.
In  this  platform  there  are  some  of them  available  as  shown  below:

 - (per process) own process memory 
 - /proc file system
 - raw access to /dev/kmem /dev/mem
 - ptrace (from user space)

Raw memory  access turns hard the  process of information  locating, as run
time information  may be paged  or swapped, and  some memory may  be shared
between processes, so for the POC it's has been removed as an option. 

Per  Process method, even  if it  may appear  to be  too exotic,  should be
considered as an option. The use of this method consists in exploitation of
the execution  of the  process selected for  dump, as for  buffer overflow,
library  modifications before loading  and any  other sophisticated  way to
execute  our  code into  process  context.  Anyway  for  the  scope of  the
analysis it's been deprecated also. 

/proc and PTRACE are the available  options for the POC.  Each one has it's
own limits  based in implementation of the  system.  As a POC,  PD will use
/proc when available, and ptrace  if there's no more options.  Consider the
use of the other methods when ptrace is not available in the system. 

By  default  ptrace will  not  attach any  process  if  it's already  being
attached by another. Each process may  be only attached by one parent. This
limit is assumed as a requirement for PD to work. 


----[ 6.1- Get information of a process

    To know  all  the  information   needed to  rebuild an executable  it's
important to know  the way  a process  is being executed  by the  system. 

As  a short description, the system  will create an  entry in  the process 
list, copy all data needed  for the process  and for the  system to success
executing the binary and  launches it.    Not all the  data in  the file is
needed during execution, some parts are only used by the loader to  correct
map the memory and perform environment setup. 

Getting information about  a process involves all data  finding that could
be useful when rebuilding the  executable file, or finding memory location
of the process, it's:

 - Dynamic linker auxiliary vector array
 - ELF signatures in memory
 - Program Headers in memory
 - task_struct and related information about the process
   (memory usage,  memory permissions, ...)
 - In raw access and pre process: permission checks of memory maps (rwx) 
 - Execution  subsystems  (as  runtime  linking,  ABI  register,
   pre-execution conditions, ..)
 

Apart from the loading information (not removed from memory by default), A
process has three  main memory sections: code, where  binary resides; data,
where internal  program data  is being  written and read;  and stack,  as a
temporal memory  pool for process execution internal  memory requests. Code
and Data segments are read from the file in the loading part by the kernel,
and  stack   is  built   by  the  loader   to  ensure   correct  execution.


----[ 6.2- Get binary data of that process from memory

    Once  we have  located that  information,  we  need to get  it from the
memory. 

For  this  task  we will  use  the  interface  selected earlier:  /proc  or
ptrace. The main information we should not forget is:

 - Code and Data portions (maps) of the memory process.
 - If exists (has not been deleted) the elf and/or program headers.
 - Dynamic linking system (if it's being) used by the program.
 - Also, "state" of the process: stack and registers*

Stack and  registers (state) are useful  when you plan to  launch the same
process  in another  moment,  or  in another  computer  but recovering  the
execution point: Froze the program and  re-run in other computer could be a
real scenario for this example. One  of the funniest results found using pd
to froze processes was the possibility to save a game and restore the saved
"state" as a way to add the "save game" feature to the XSoldier game. 

Something interesting is also  another information the process is currently
handling:  file  descriptors, signals,  and  so.   With  the signals,  file
descriptors,  memory,  stack  and  registers  we could  "froze"  a  running
application  and  restore  it's  execution  in  other  host,  or  in  other
moment.  Due  to  the  design  of  the  process creation, it's possible to 
recreate in great part the state  of the process  even if  it's interacting
with  regular files.  In  a more  technical detail,  the re-create  process
will inherit all the attributes of  the parent, including file descriptors.
It's our task  if  we would   like  to  restore   a  "frozen state"  dumped
process to read the position  of the  descriptors and  restore them for the
"frozen process". 

Please  notice that  any  other  interaction  using  sockets  or pipes  for
example, require  an state analysis  of the  communicated messages so their
value, or  streamed content  may be lost.   If you  dump  a program  in the
middle  of a TCP  connection, TCP  session will  not be  established again,
neither the  sent data and  acknowledge messages received  from  the remote
system, so it's  not possible to re-run a process from  a "frozen state" in
all cases. 


----[ 6.3- Order/Clean and safe binary data in a file

    Order/Clean  and  safe  task  is   the  simplest   one.  Get  all   the
available information and remove the useless, sort  the useful, and save in
a secure storage.  It  has been separated  from  the  whole  process due to
limitations in the recovering conditions. If the reconstructed binary could
be stored in the filesystem then simply keep the  information  saved  in  a
file, but, it's interesting in some cases to  send the gathered information
to another host for processing, not writing to  disk, and not modifying the
filesystem  for  other  type   of  analysis.    This   will   avoid   data 
contraception  in  a  compromised  system if  that's  the  purpose  of  pd 
execution. 

 
 
----[ 6.4- Build an ELF header for that file to be loaded

    If finally we don't find it in memory, the best way  is  to rebuild it.
Using the ELF documentation  would be easy  enough to  setup a basic header
with the information  gathered.  It's  also necessary  to create  a program
headers table if we could not find it in memory. 

Even if the ELF header is  found in memory, a manipulation of the structure
is needed as we could miss a lot of information not kept in memory, or not
necessary for the  rebuild process: For example, all  the information about
file  sections,  debug  information  or  any kind  of  informational  data.


----[ 6.5- Adjust binary information

    At this point, all the information has  been  gathered,  and the  basic
skeleton of the executable should be ready to use. But before finishing the
reconstruction process some final steps could be performed. 

As some  binary data is  copied from memory  and glued into a  binary, some
offset and  header information  (as number of  memory maps and  ELF related
information) need to be adjusted. 

Also, if it's  using some system feature (let's  say, runtime linking) some
of the gathered information may be referred to this  host  linking  system,
and need to be rebuilt in order to work in another environments. 

As  the result  of reconstruction  we have  two great  caveats  to resolve:

 - Elf header 
 - Dynamic linking system

 The  elf header is  only used  in the  load time,  so we  need to  setup a
 compatible header to load correctly all the information we have got. 

 The dynamic system relies in host library scheme, so we need to regenerate
 a  new layout  or restore  the previous  one to  a generic  usable dynamic
 system, it's:  GOT recovering.  PD resolves  this issue in  an elegant and
 easy way explained later. 
 

----[ 6.6 - Resume of process in steps

    Now let's resume  with more granularity the steps  performed until now,
and what could be   do with all the gathered information.   As  a  generic 
approach let's resume a "process saving" procedure:

 - Froze the process  (avoid any malicious reaction of the program..).
 - Stop current execution and attach to it (or inject code.. or..).
 - Save "state": registers, stack and all information from the system.
 - Recover file descriptors state and all system data used by the process.
 - Copy process "base": files needed (opened file descriptors, libraries,
   ... ).
 - Copy data from memory: copy code segments, data segments, stack,
   libraries..

With all this information we can now do two things:
 
    - Rebuild the  single executable: reconstruct a binary  file that could
    be launched  in any host (with  the same architecture,  of course), or
    executable  only in  the same  host, but  allowing complete  execution 
    from the start of the code. 
 
    - Prepare a package allowing to re-execute the process in another host,
    or in any other moment, that's, a "frozen" application that will resume
    it's state  once launched.   This will allow  us to save  a suspicious
    process and relaunch in other host preserving it's state. 


If it's  our intention to  recover the state  in other moment, even  if its
recovery is not  totally guaranteed (internal system workflow  may avoid 
its correct execution) the loading process will be:

 - Set all files used by the application in the correct location
 - Open the files  used by the program  and move handlers to  the same
   position (file handlers will be inherited by child process)
 - Create a new process.
 - Set "base" (code and data) in the correct segments of memory.
 - set stack and registers.
 - launch execution.
 

But for the purpose  of this paper, the final stage is  to rebuild a binary
file, a single  executable presumed to be reconstructed  from the image of
the process  being executed  in the  memory. These are  the final  steps we
could see later, labeled as pd implementation:
 
 - Create an ELF header in a file: if it could not be found.
 - Attach "base" to the file (code and data memory copies)
 - Readjust GOT (dynamic linking).


----[ 6.7 - pd (process dumper) Proof of concept.

    At the time of writing this paper, a simple process dumper is included 
for  testing  purposes.  Although it  contains  basic  working code, it's 
recommended to download  the latest version  of  the   program   from   the
http://www.reversing.org  web site.  The  version included  here is  a very
basic stripped version  developed two years ago. This PD is  just a POC for
testing the process described in this article supporting dynamically linked
binaries.  This is the description  of the different tasks it will perform:

   - Ptrace attach to a pid: to access memory (mainly read memory) process.

   - Information  gathering: Everytime  a program  is executed,  the system
 will create  an special  struct in  the memory for  the dynamic  linker to
 success  bind  functions of  that  process.   That  struct, the  "Auxiliar
 Vector" holds  some elf  related information of  the original file,  as an
 offset  to the  program  headers  location in  memory,  number of  program
 headers  and so  (there  is some  doc  about this  special  struct in  the
 included source package). 

 With the program headers information recovered, a loop  for  memory  maps 
 being  saved to  a file  is  started.   Program header  holds  the loaded 
 program segments.  We'll  care in  the  LOAD  flag  of the  mapped  memory
 segment in  order to save it. Memory  segments not marked as  LOAD are not
 loaded from  that file for  execution. This version  of PD does  not use 
 /proc filesystem at any time. 

 If the  program  can't find the  information, some of  the arguments  from
 command line may  help to finish the process. For  example, with "-p addr"
 it's possible  to force  the address of  the program headers  in memory. 
 This  value for  gcc+ldd built  binaries is  0x8048034.  This argument may
 be used  when the program outputs  the message "search failed" when trying
 to locate  PAGESZ. If PAGESZ  is not  in the stack  it indicates  that the
 "auxiliar vector  array" could not  be located, so program  headers offset
 would neither  be found (often  when the file  is not launched  from the
 shell  or  is   loaded  by   other   program  instead   of  the  kernel). 
	 
   - File dumping:  If the information is  located the data is  dumped to a
 file,  including the  elf  header if  it's  found in  memory (rarely  it's
 deleted  by any  application).   This version  of  pd will NOT create  any
 header for the file (it's done in the lastest version). 

 This dump should work for the  local host,  as dynamic information  is not
 being rebuilt.  There's a simple method  to recover  this information with
 files built with gcc+ldd as shown below. 
   
   - GOT rebuilding

   The runtime  linker should had modified  some of the GOT  entries if the
 functions had  been called during execution.  The way pd  rebuilds the GOT
 is  based in GCC  compiling method.   Any binary  file is  very compiler
 dependant (not  only system), and a fast analysis about  how GCC+LDD build
 the GOT of  the compiled binary, shows the way  to reconstruct  it  called
 "Aggressive GOT reconstruction".  Another compilers/linkers  may need more
 in depth  study.  A  txt is  included  in the  source about Aggressive GOT
 reconstruction. 
   
 The option -l tagged as "local  execution only" in the command line will
 avoid GOT reconstruction. 
 
   In this  version of PD,  PLT/GOT reconstruction is only  functional with
 GCC  compiled binaries.  To  make that  reconstruction,  the .plt  section
 should be  located (done by the program usually).  If the location  is not
 found by the PD, the argument -g addr in the command line  may help.  Even
 if it has been tested against several files, this so simple implementation
 may fail  with  files  using hard  dynamic  linking in  the system.

 Once  again I  remember this  is a test  code.  For better results please 
 download latest version of PD. 

   -- Aggressive reconstruction of GOT --
   
   GCC in  the process  of compiling a  source code  makes a table  for the
 relocation entries  to link with ldd. This table grows as  source file  is
 being analyzed.  Each  relocatable object  is then pushed  in  a table for
 internal manipulation. Each  table entry  has a size  of 0x10 bytes,  each
 entry is located 0x10 bytes from  the last, so there are 16 bytes  between
 each   object.    Take   a   look    at   this   output    of   readelf. 
   
  Relocation section '.rel.plt' at offset 0x308 contains 8 entries:

  As shown  below, each of  the entries from  the table is just  0x10 bytes
  below than  the next  in memory  . When one of this  objects is linked in
  runtime, it's  value will show a library space memory address out  of the
  original segment.   Rebuilding this  table is done  locating at  least an
  unresolved  value from this  list (it's  symbol value must be inside it's
  program  section memory space). Original address  could then  be obtained
  from It's position. 

  The  next  step  is  to  perform  a replace  in  all  entries  marked  as
  R_386_JUMP_SLOT with the calculated address for each modified entry. 
  Note: Other  compilers may  act very different, so the  first step  is to
  fingerprint the compiler before doing any un-relocation task. 

  Some options  are manipulable in  command line to pd. See readme for more
  information.  Also,  some demos are included  in  the src package, and a 
  simple todo  with help to launch each them: simple process  dump, packed 
  dump (upx or burneye), injected code dump and grugq's ulexec dump. 

  Here is, for your information a simple dump of a netcat process connected
  to a host:

In this  example the  program netcat with  pid 5114  is dumped to  the file
nc.dumped. The  reconstructed binary is only  part of the  original file as
show in these lists:

This version of  pd does all the  tasks of rebuilding a binary  file from a
process. The pd concept was  re-developed to a more useful tool performing
two  steps. The first  should help  recovering all  the information  from a
process in a single package. With all this information a second stage allow
to rebuild  the executable  in more relaxed  environment, as other  host or
another moment. The option to save  and restore state of a process has been
added thus  allowing to re-lauch an  application in other host  in the same
state as it was when the  information was gathered. Go to reversing.org web
site to get the last version of the program. 



--[ 7.0 - Defeating PD, or defeating process dumping.

    The  process   presented   in  this  article  suffers   from  lots  of 
presumptions: tested  with gcc compiled  binaries, under  specified  system
models,  its workflow simply  depends  on  several  system  conditions and 
information that could be forged by the program.   However  following  the
method would be easy to defeat further antidump research. 

In each recovering  process task, some of the  information is presumed, and
other is obtained  but never evaluated before. Although  the process may be
reviewed for  error and  consistency checking a  generic flow will not work
against  an specific  developed program.   For example,  it's very  easy to
remove  all  data information  from  memory to  avoid  pd  reading all  the
needings in the rebuild process. Elf header could be deleted in runtime, or
modified, as the auxiliar vector in the stack, or the program headers. 

There are  other methods to get  the binary information:  asking the kernel
about  a  process or  accessing  in raw  format  to  memory locating  known
structures and so,  but not only it's a very hard  approach, the system may
be forged by an intruder. Never forget that.. 

Current issues known in PD are:

 - If the program is being ptraced, this condition will prevent pd
 attaching process to work, so program ends here (for now).
 
   Solution: enable a kernel process to dump binary information even if
   ptrace is disabled.
 
 - If a forged ELF header is found in the system, probably it will be used
 instead of the real one.
 
   Solution: manually inspect ELF header or program headers found in the
   system before accepting them.
 
 - If no information about program headers or elf is found, and if /proc is
 not available in that user space, and aux_vt is not found the program will
 not work, and..
 
   Solution: perform a better approach in pd.c.  PD is just a POC code to
   show the process of rebuild a binary file.  In a real
   
 - Some kernel patches remove memory contents and modify binary file prior
 to execution: Unspected behavior.


Anyway, PD  will not  work well  with programs where  the data  segment has
variables  modified  in runtime,  as  execution  of  the recovered  program
depends in  the state of these  variables. There's no  history about memory
modified by a process, so return to a previous state of the data segment is
impossible, again, for now. 


--[ 8.0 - Conclusion

    "Reversing" term reveals a funny feature:  every time a  new  technique
appears, another one defeat it,  in both sides.  As in the virus  scene, a
new patch will  follow to  a new  development. Everytime  a new  forensics
method is released, a  new anti-forensics  one appears.   There's  a  crack
for almost every protected application, and a new version of  that  program
will protect from that crack. 

In  this  paper,  some of  the  methods  hiding  code  (even if  it's  not
malicious)  were defeated  with simply  reversing how  a process  is built.
Further investigation may leave this  method inefficient due to load design
of the kernel in the studied system.  In fact, once a method is known, it's
easy to defeat, and the one  presented in this article is not an exception
