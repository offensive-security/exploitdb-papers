--[ I.    Introduction


Nowadays there are many exploit prevention mechanisms for windows but each 
of them can by bypassed (according to my information). Reading this 
article keep in mind that codes and information provided here will 
increase security of your system but it doesn't mean you will be 
completely safe (cut&paste from condom box user manual).


--[ II.   Known protections


Like I said before, today there exist many commercial prevention 
mechanisms. Here we will get a little bit deeper inside of most common 
ring3 mechanisms. 


II.A   Hooking API functions and stack backtracing
--------------------------------------------------

Many nowadays buffer overflows protectors are not preventing the buffer 
overflow attack itself, but are only trying to detect running shellcode. 
Such BO protectors usually hook API functions that usually are used by 
shellcode. Hooking can be done in ring3 (userland) or kernel level (ring0, 
mainly syscalls and native api hooking). Lets take a look at example of 
such actions:


stack backtracing
-----------------

Lets check the NGSEC stack backtracing mechanism, now imagine a call was 
made to the API function hooked by NGSEC Stack Defender.

So when a call to any of hooked APIs is done, the main Stack Defender 
mechanism stored in proxydll.dll will be loaded by the hooked function 
stored in .reloc section. Then following tests will be done:


Generally this comes up as params for the proxydll function (all of the 
arguments are integers):
assume:	 argument 1 = [esp+0ch] - its "first" passed argument to the 
		      function this is always equal to the stack address 
                      0xC bytes from the ESP.
         argument 2 = address from where hooked api was called 
         argument 3 = some single integer (no special care for this one)
	 argument 4 = stack address of given param thru hooked API call
         

MAIN STEPS:
- I. 	- execute VirtualQuery [1] on [esp+0Ch] (stack address)-LOCATION1
- II. 	- execute VirtualQuery [1] on call_ret address - LOCATION2
- III.	- if LOCATION1 allocation base returned in one of the members of
	  MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION [2] is equal to the LOCATION2 
          allocation base then the call is comming for the stack space. 
          Stack Defender kills the application and reports attack probe to 
          the user. If not next step is executed.
- IV. 	- call IsBadWritePtr [3] on location marked as LOCATION2 (addres 
          of caller). If the API returns that location is writeable Stack 
          Defender finds it as a shellcode and kills the application. If 
          location is not writeable StackDefender executes the original 
          API.





hooking exported API functions 
------------------------------

When module exports some function it means that it's making this fuction 
usable for other modules. When such function is exported, PE file includes
an information about exported function in so called export section. 
Hooking exported function is based on changing the exported function 
address in AddressOfFunctions entry in the export section. The great and 
one of the first examples of such action was very infamous i-worm.Happy 
coded by french virus writter named as Spanska. This one hooks send and 
connects APIs exported from WSOCK32.DLL in order to monitor all outgoing 
messages from the infected machine. This technique was also used by one of 
the first win32 BO protectors - the NGSEC's Stack Defender 1.10. The NGSEC 
mechanism modifies the original windows kernel (kernel32.dll) and hooks 
the following functions:

(the entries for each of the exported functions in EAT (Export Address 
Table) were changed, each function was hooked and its address was 
"repointed" to the .reloc section where the filtering procedure will 
be executed)

- WinExec
- CreateProcessW
- CreateProcessA
- LoadLibraryExA
- LoadLibraryExW
- OpenFile 
- CreateThread
- CreateRemoteThread
- GetProcAddress
- LoadModule
- CreateFileA
- CreateFileW 
- _lopen
- _lcreat
- CopyFileA
- CopyFileW
- CopyFileExA 
- CopyFileExW 
- MoveFileA 
- MoveFileExW
- LockFile
- GetModuleHandleA
- VirtualProtect
- OpenProcess
- GetModuleHandleW
- MoveFileWithProgressA
- MoveFileWithProgressW 
- DeleteFileA 




inline API hooking
------------------

This technique is based on overwritting the first 5 bytes of API function
with call or unconditional jump. 

I must say that one of the first implementations of such "hooking" 
technique (well i don't mean the API hooking method excatly) was described
by GriYo in [12]. The feature described by GriYo was named "EPO" - 
"Entry-point Obscuring". Instead of changing the ENTRYPOINT of PE file [9]
GriYo placed a so called "inject",a jump or call to virus inside host code
but far away from the file entry-point. This EPO technique makes a virus 
detection much much harder...

Of course the emulated bytes must be first known by the "hooker". So it 
generally must use some disassembler engine to determine instructions 
length and to check its type (i think you know the bad things can happen 
if you try to run grabbed call not from native location). Then those 
instructions are stored locally and after that they are simply executed 
(emulated). After that the execution is returned to native location. Just
like the schema shows.

Inline API hooking feature is also present in Detours library developed 
by Microsoft [4]. Here is the standard sample how hooked function looks 
like:

	BEFORE:
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	CreateProcesA: 		push ebp		; 1 bytes
			        mov ebp,esp		; 2 bytes
			        push 0			; 2 bytes
			        push dword ptr [ebp+2c]
				...
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

	AFTER (SCHEMA):
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	CreateProcessA:		jmp hooked_function
	where_ret:		push dword ptr [ebp+2c]
				...


	hooked_function:	pushfd			; save flags
				pushad			; save regs
				call do_checks		; do some checks
				popad			; load regs
				popfd			; loadflags
				
				push ebp		; emulation
				mov ebp,esp		; of original
				push 0			; bytes

				push offset where_ret	; return to
				ret			; original func.


	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

Such type of hooking method was implemented in Okena/CSA and Entercept
commercial mechanisms. When the hooked function is executed, BO prevention
mechanism does similiar checks like in described above.

However BO preventers that use such feature can be defeat easily. Because 
I don't want to copy other phrack articles I suggest you looking at
"Bypassing 3rd Party Windows Buffer Overflow Protection" [5] (phrack#62).
It is a good article about bypassing such mechanisms.

II.B   Security cookie authentication (stack protection)
--------------------------------------------------------

This technique was implemented in Windows 2003 Server, and it is very
often called as "build in Windows 2003 Server stack protection". In
Microsoft Visual C++ .NET Microsoft added a "/GS" switch (default on)
which place security cookies while generating the code. The cookie
(or canary) is placed on the stack before the saved return address 
when a function is called. Before the procedure returns to the caller 
the security cookie is checked with its "prototype" version
stored in the .data section. If the buffer overflow occurs the cookie
is overwritten and it mismatches with the "prototype" one. This is the
sign of buffer overflow.


Bypassing this example was well documented by David Litchfield so I
advice you to take a look at the lecture [6].


II.C   Additional mechanisms - module rebasing
----------------------------------------------

When we talk about buffer overflow prevention mechanism we shouldn't 
forget about so called "module rebasing". What is the idea of this 
technique? Few chapters lower you have an example code from "searching for
kernel in memory" section, there you can find following variables:


	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	; some of kernel base values used by Win32.ls
	_kernells           label
	dd 077e80000h - 1   ;NT 5
	dd 0bff70000h - 1   ;w9x
	dd 077f00000h - 1   ;NT 4
	dd -1
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

Like you probably know only these kernel locations in the table will be
searched, what happens if shellcode doesn't know the imagebase of
needed module (and all the search procedures failed)? Answer is easy
shellcode can't work and it quits/crashes in most cases.

How the randomization is done? Generally all PE files(.exe/.dlls etc. etc)
have an entry in the PE record (offset 34h) which contains the address 
where the module should be loaded. By changing this value we are able to 
relocate the module we want, of course this value must be well calculated 
otherwise your system can be working incorrectly.

Now, after little overview of common protections we can study the
shellcode itself.


--[ III.  What is shellcode and what it "must do"

For those who don't know: Shellcode is a part of code which does all the 
dirty work (spawns a shell / drops trojans / bla bla) and it's a core of 
exploit. 

What windows shellcode must do? Lets take a look at the following sample 
schema:

1) - getting EIP
2) - decoding loop if it's needed
3) - getting addresses of kernel/needed functions
4) - spawning a shell and all other dirty things

If you read assumptions (point II) and some other papers you will 
probably know that there is no way to cut third point from shellcode 
schema.  Every windows shellcode must obtain needed data and that's a step
we will try to detect.

Of course shellcode may use the hardcoded kernel value or hardcoded API 
values. That doesn't mean that shellcode will be not working, but 
generally things get harder when attacker doesn't know the victim machine 
(version of operating system - different windows = different kernel 
addresses) or when the victim machine works with some protection levels 
like image base rebasing. Generally hardcoding those values decreases the 
success level of the shellcode.



--[ IV.   Getting addresses of kernel/needed functions - enemy study

This chapter describes shortly most common methods used in shellcodes. To 
dig more deeply inside the stuff I advice you to read some papers from the 
Reference section

--[ IV.A   - getting kernel address (known mechanisms)

IV.A.A  -  PEB (Process Environment Block) parsing
--------------------------------------------------

PEB (Process Environment Block) parsing - the following method was first 
introduced by the guy called Ratter [7] from infamous 29A group. By 
parsing the PEB_LDR_DATA we can obtain information about all currently
loaded modules, like following example shows:

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

	mov eax,dword ptr fs:[30h]	; EAX is now PEB base
	mov eax,dword ptr [eax+0ch]	; EAX+0Ch = PEB_LDR_DATA
	mov esi,dword ptr [eax+1ch]	; get the first entry

	mov ebx,[esi+08h]		; EBX=ntdll imagebase

	module_loopx:
	lodsd
	mov ebx,[eax+08h]		; EBX=next dll imagebase
	test ebx,ebx
	jz @last_one_done
	int 3
	mov esi,eax			; continue search
	jmp module_loopx

	;----------SNIP---------------------------------------------



IV.A.B  -  searching for kernel in memory   
-----------------------------------------

searching for kernel in memory - this example scans/tries different kernel 
locations (for different windows versions) and searches for MZ and PE 
markers, the search progress works together with SEH frame to avoid access 
violations. 

Here is the example method (fragment of Win32.ls virus): 


	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
      
	cld                                       
	lea esi,[ebp + offset _kernells - @delta] ; load the kernel 
                                                  ; array

	@nextKernell:
	lodsd                ; load on base to EAX
	push esi             ; preserve ESI (kernel array location)
	inc eax              ; is this the last one ? (-1+1=0)
	jz @bad              ; seems so -> no kernel base matched

	push ebp             ; preserve EBP (delta handler)
	call @kernellSEH     ; check the loaded base

	mov esp,[esp + 08h]  ; restore the stack
          
	@bad1:
	pop dword ptr fs:[0] ; restore old SEH frame
	pop eax              ; normalize the stack
	pop ebp              ; load delta handle
	pop esi              ; go back to kernel array
	jmp @nextKernell     ; and check another base…

	@bad:
	pop eax              ; no kernel found, virus
	jmp @returnHost      ; returning to host
 
	; some of kernel base values used by Win32.ls
	_kernells           label
	dd 077e80000h - 1   ;NT 5
	dd 0bff70000h - 1   ;w9x
	dd 077f00000h - 1   ;NT 4
	dd -1
 
	@kernellSEH:
	push dword ptr fs:[0]         ; setup new SHE handler
	mov dword ptr fs:[0],esp
	mov ebx,eax                   ; EBX=imagebase
	xchg eax,esi     
	xor eax,eax
	lodsw                         ; get first 2 bytes from imagebase
	not eax                       ; is it MZ?
	cmp eax,not 'ZM'              ; compare
	jnz @bad1                     ; it isn't check next base
	mov eax,[esi + 03ch]          ; MZ is found now scan for PE sign
	add eax,ebx                   ; normalize (RVA2VA)
	xchg eax,esi                  
	lodsd                         ; read 4 bytes
	not eax		
	cmp eax,not 'EP'              ; is it PE?
	jnz @bad1                     ; nope check next base
          
	pop dword ptr fs:[0]          ; return (setup) old SEH
	pop eax ebp esi               ; clear stack
	                              ; EBX is now valid kernel base
     
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------


--[ IV.B   - getting API addresses (known methods)


IV.B.A  -  export section parsing 
---------------------------------

export section parsing - when the module (usually kernel32.dll) base is 
located, shellcode can scan export section and find some API functions 
needed for later use. Usually shellcode is searching for GetProcAddress() 
function address, then it is used to get location of the others APIs. 

Following code parses kernel32.dll export section and gets address of 
GetProcAddress API:

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	; EAX=imagebase of kernel32.dll

	xor ebp,ebp		      ; zero the counter
	mov ebx,[eax+3ch]	      ; get pe header
	add ebx,eax		      ; normalize

	mov edx,[ebx+078h]	      ; export section RVA
	add edx,eax		      ; normalize

	mov ecx,[edx+020h]            ; address of names
	add ecx,eax                   ; normalize
	mov esi,[edx+01ch]            ; address of functions
	add esi,eax	              ; normalize

	loop_it:
	mov edi,[ecx]                 ; get one name
	add edi,eax                   ; normalize
	cmp dword ptr [edi+4],'Acor'  ; is it GetP-rocA-ddress ?? :)
	jne @l                        ; nope -> jump to @l

	                              ; yes it is
	add esi,ebp	              ; add out counter
	mov esi,[esi]                 ; get the address
	add esi,eax	              ; normalize
	int 3	                      ; ESI=address of GetProcAddress

	@l:
	add ecx,4                     ; to next name
	add ebp,4                     ; update counter (dwords)
	jmp loop_it	              ; and loop it again

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------



IV.B.B  -  import section parsing 
---------------------------------

import section parsing - 99% of hll applications import 
GetProcAddress/LoadLibraryA, it means that their IAT (Import Address 
Table) includes address and name string of the mentioned functions. 
If shellcode "knows" the imagebase of target application it can easily 
grab needed address from the IAT. 

Just like following code shows:


	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	;following example gets LoadLibraryA address from IAT

	IMAGEBASE 		equ 00400000h 

	mov ebx,IMAGEBASE
	mov eax,ebx
	add eax,[eax+3ch]                     ; PE header

	mov edi,[eax+80h]                     ; import RVA
	add edi,ebx                           ; normalize
	xor ebp,ebp

	mov edx,[edi+10h]                     ; pointer to addresses
	add edx,ebx                           ; normalize

	mov esi,[edi]                         ; pointer to ascii strings
	add esi,ebx                           ; normalize

	@loop:
	mov eax,[esi]
	add eax,ebx
	add eax,2
	cmp dword ptr [eax],'daoL'            ; is this LoadLibraryA?
	jne @l
	
	add edx,ebp                           ; normalize
	mov edx,[edx]                         ; edx=address of 
	int 3				      ; LoadLibraryA

	@l:
	add ebp,4                             ; increase counter
	add esi,4                             ; next name
	jmp @loop                             ; loop it

        ;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------


After this little introduction we can finally move to real things.


--[ V.    New prevention techniques


While thinking about buffer overflow attacks I've noticed that methods
from chapter IV are most often used in shellcodes. And thats the thing
I wanted to prevent, I wanted to develop prevention technique which acts 
in very early stage of shellcode execution and here are the results of 
my work:

Why two Protty libraries / two techniques of prevention? 

When I have coded first Protty (P1) library it worked fine except some
Microsoft products like Internet Explorer, Explorer.exe (windows manager) 
etc. in thoose cases the prevention mechanisms eat all cpu.
I simply got nervous and I have rebuilt the mechanisms and that's how 
second Protty (P2) library was born. Im describing them both because 
everything that gives any bit of knowledge is worth describing :) Anyway 
Im not saying the second one is perfect each solution got its bad and
good points.

What I have done - the protection features:
- protecting EXPORT section - protecting function addresses array 
  (any exe/dll library)
- IAT RVA killer (any exe/dll library)
- protecting IAT - protecting functions names array (any exe/dll library)
- protecting PEB (Process Environment Block)
- disabling SEH/Unhandled Exception Filter usage
- RtlEnterCrticialSection pointer protector


NOTE: 	All those needed pointers (IMPORT/EXPORT sections) are found in 
	similiar way like in IVth chapter.



FEATURE: EXPORT SECTION PROTECTION (protecting "function addresses array")
-------

Every shellcode that parses EXPORT section (mainly kernel32.dll one) want
to get to exported function addresses, and that's the thing I tried to
block, here is the technique:

Algorithm/method for mechanism used in Protty1 (P1):
---------------------------------------------------

1. Allocate enough memory to handle Address Of Functions table from
   the export section.

     Address of Function table is an array which cointains addresses 
     of exported API functions, like here for KERNEL32.DLL:

     D:\>tdump kernel32.dll kernel32.txt & type kernel32.txt


	(...snip...)
	Name                   RVA       Size  
    	------------------  --------  --------
    	Exports             0006D040  00006B39
	(...snip...)


	Exports from KERNEL32.dll
        942 exported name(s), 942 export addresse(s).  Ordinal base is 1.

     	Ordinal RVA       Name
     	------- --------  ----
     	0000    000137e8  ActivateActCtx
     	0001    000093fe  AddAtomA
     	0002    0000d496  AddAtomW
     	0003    000607c5  AddConsoleAliasA
     	0004    0006078e  AddConsoleAliasW
     	0005    0004e0a1  AddLocalAlternateComputerNameA
     	0006    0004df8c  AddLocalAlternateComputerNameW

    	(...snip...)


   	Where RVA values are entries from Address of Functions table, so 
        if first exported symbol is ActivateActCtx, first entry of Address
        of Function will be its RVA. The size of Address of Functions 
        table depends on number of exported functions.

	All those IMPORT / EXPORT sections structures are very well 
        documented in Matt Pietrek, "An In-Depth Look into the Win32 
        Portable Executable File Format" paper [9].


2. Copy original addresses of functions to the allocated memory.
3. Make original function addresses entries writeable.
4. Erase all old function addresses.
5. Make erased function addresses entries readable only.
6. Update the pointer to Address of Functions tables and point it to our
   allocated memory:
   - Make page that contains pointer writeable.
   - Overwrite with new location of Address of Function Table
   - Make page that contains pointer readable again.


7. Mark allocated memory (new function addresses) as PAGE_NOACCESS.

   We couldn't directly set the PAGE_NOACCESS protection to original 
   function addresses because some other data in the same page must be 
   also accessible (well SAFE_MEMORY_MODE should cover all cases even when
   protection of original page was changed to PAGE_NOACCESS - however such
   action increases CPU usage of the mechanism). The best way seems to be
   to allocate new memory region for it.

   What does the PAGE_NOACCESS protection? :

   - PAGE_NOACCESS disables all access to the committed region of pages. 
     An attempt to read from, write to, or execute in the committed region
     results in an access violation exception, called a general protection
     (GP) fault.

   Now all references to the table with function addresses will cause an
   access violation exception, the description of the exception checking 
   mechanism is written in next chapter ("Description of mechanism 
   implemented in ...").


   

Just like the schema shows (A. - stands for "address"):

What have I gained by switching from the first method (real arrays) to the 
second one (decoys)?

The answer is easy. The first one was pretty slow solution (all the time i
needed to deprotect the region and protect is again) in the second one i 
don't have to de-protect and protect the real array, the only thing i need
to do  is update the register value and make it point to the orginal 
requested body. 



FEATURE: IMPORT SECTION PROTECTION (protecting "functions names array" + 
-------  IAT RVA killer)

IAT RVA killer mechanism for both Protty1 (P1) and Protty2 (P2)
---------------------------------------------------------------

All actions are similar to those taken in previous step, however here we 
are redirecting IMPORTS function names and overwriting IAT RVA (with 
pseudo random value returned by GetTickCount - bit swapped).

And here is the schema which shows IAT RVA killing:

  (*) - the IMPORT RVA is overwritten with value returned by GetTickCount
        swaped one time, generally it's kind of idiotic action because 
        many of you can assume such operation can give a drastic effect 
        with application stability. Well you are wrong, overwritting the 
	IMPORT RVA >after< successful loading of any pe module has no 
        right to cause instability (atleast it worked in my case, remeber
	this is windows and you are messing a lot ...)

FEATURE: Disabling SEH / Unhandled Exception Filter pointer usage.
-------

Description for both Protty1 (P1) and Protty 2 (P2)
---------------------------------------------------

Every time access violation exception occurs in protected program, 
prevention mechanism tests if the currently active SEH frame points 
to writeable location, if so Protty will stop the execution. 

If UEF_HEURISTISC is set to TRUE (1) Protty will check that actual
set Unhandled Exception Filter starts with prolog (push ebp/mov ebp,esp)
or starts with (push esi/mov esi,[esp+8]) otherwise Protty will kill
the application. After this condition Protty checks that currently
active Unhandled Exception Filter is writeable if so application
is terminated (this also stands out for the default non heuristisc
mode).

Why UEF? Unhandled Exception Filter is surely one of the most used
methods within exploiting windows heap overflows. The goal of this
method is to setup our own Unhandled Filter, then when any unhandled
exception will occur attackers code can be executed. Normally attacker
tries to set UEF to point to call dword ptr [edi+78h], because
78h bytes past EDI there is a pointer to the end of the buffer.
To get more description of this exploitation technique check point [8] 
from Reference section.

NOTE: Maybe there should be also a low HEURISTICS mode with 
      jmp dword ptr [edi+78h] / call dword ptr [edi+78h] occurency
      checker, however the first one covers them all.



FEATURE: RtlEnterCrticialSection pointer protector
-------

Description for both Protty1 (P1) and Protty 2 (P2)
---------------------------------------------------

Like in above paragraph, library checks if pointer to 
RtlEnterCriticalSection pointer has changed, if it did, prevention 
library immediately resets the original pointer and stops the program 
execution. 

RtlEnterCritical pointer is often used in windows heap overflows 
exploitation. 

Here is the sample attack:

	(sample scenerio of heap overflow)
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	; EAX, ECX are controled by attacker
	; assume: 
	; ECX=07FFDF020h (RtlEnterCrticialSection pointer)
	; EAX=location where attacker want to jump

	mov     [ecx],eax		; overwrites the pointer
	mov     [eax+0x4],ecx		; probably causes access 
                                        ; violation
					; if so the execution is 
                                        ; returned to "EAX"
	
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

You should also notice that even when the access violation will not
occur it doesn't mean attackers code will be not excuted. 
Many functions (not directly) are calling RtlEnterCriticalSection 
(the address where 07FFDF020h points), so attacker code can be 
executed for example while calling ExitProcess API. To find more 
details on this exploitation technique check point [10] from Reference 
section.


FEATURE: position independent code, running in dynamicaly allocated memory
-------

Protty library is a position independent code since it uses so called
"delta handling". Before start of the mechanism Protty allocates memory
at random location and copy its body there, and there it is executed.

What is delta handling? Lets take a look at the following code:

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	call delta			; put delta label offset on the 
                                        ; stack
	delta: 	pop ebp			; ebp=now delta offset
		sub ebp offset delta	; now sub the linking value of 
                                        ; "delta"
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

As you can see delta handle is a numeric value which helps you with 
addressing variables/etc. especially when your code do not lay in native 
location. 

Delta handling is very common technique used by computer viruses. Here is
a little pseudo code which shows how to use delta handling with
addressing:

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	;ebp=delta handle
	mov eax,dword ptr [ebp+variable1]
	lea ebx,[ebp+variable2]
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	
Of course any register (not only EBP) can be used :)

The position independent code was done to avoid easy disabling/patching by 
the shellcode itself.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|Description of mechanism implemented in Protty1 (P1)|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: That all features written here were described above.
      You can find complete descriptions there (or links to them). 	

Mechanism takeovers the control of KiUserExceptionDispatcher API (exported
 by NTDLL.DLL) and that's where the main mechanism is implemented. From 
that point every exception (caused by program) is being filtered by 
our library. To be const-stricto, used mechanism only filters all Access 
Violations exceptions. When such event occurs Protty first checks if the 
active SEH (Structured Exception Handler) frame points to good location
(not writeable) if the result is ok it continues testing, otherwise it 
terminates the application. After SEH frame checking, library checks the 
address where violation came from, if its bad (writeable) the program 
is terminated. Then it is doing the same with pointer to Unhandled 
Exception Filter. Next it checks if pointer to RtlEnterCriticalSection 
was changed (very common and useful technique for exploiting windows based
heap overflows) and kills the application if it was (of course the pointer
to RtlEnterCriticalSection is being reset in the termination procedure).
If application wasn't signed as BAD and terminated so far, mechanism must
check if violation was caused by reference to our protected memory 
regions, if not it just returns execution to original handler. 
Otherwise it checks if memory which caused the exception is stored 
somewhere on the stack or is writeable. If it is, program is terminated. 
When the reference to protected memory comes from GOOD location, mechanism
resets protection of needed region and emulates the instruction which 
caused access violation exception (im using z0mbie's LDE32 to determine 
instruction length), after the emulation, library marks requested region 
with PAGE_NOACCESS again and continues program execution. That's all - 
for more information check the source codes attached and test it in 
action. (Take a look at the "catched shellcodes" written in next section)

In the time of last add-ons for the article, Phrack stuff noticed me that
single stepping will be more good solution. I must confess it really can
do its job in more fast way. I mark it as TODO.



Few words about the emulation used in P1:
----------------------------------------

Generally I have two ways of doing it. You already know one. I'm going to 
describe another one now. 

Instead of placing jump after instruction that caused the access violation 
exception I could emulate it locally, it's generally more slower/faster
more weird (?), who cares (?) but it should work also. Here is the short 
description of what have to be done:

(optional algorithm replacement for second description written below)
STEP 1   - Get instruction length, copy the instruction to local buffer
STEP 2   - Deprotect needed region
STEP 3   - Change the contexts, of course leave the EIP alone :)) save
           the old context somewhere
STEP 4   - Emulate the instruction
STEP 5   - Update the "target" context, reset old context
STEP 6   - Protect all regions again
STEP 7   - continue program execution by NtContinue() function


And here is the more detailed description of currently used 
instruction emulation mechanism in Protty:

STEP 1   - Deprotect needed region
STEP 2   - Get instruction length
STEP 3   - Make the location (placed after instruction) writeable
STEP 4   - Save 7 bytes from there
STEP 5   - Patch it with jump 
STEP 6   - use NtContinue() to continue the execution, after executing
           the first instruction, second one (placed jump) returns 
           the execution to Protty.
STEP 7   - Reset old 7 bytes to original location (un-hooking)
STEP 8   - Mark the location (placed after instruction) as 
           PAGE_EXECUTE_READ (not writeable)
STEP 9   - Protect all regions again, return to "host"



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|Description of mechanism implemented in Protty2 (P2)|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The newer version of Protty library (P2) also resides in 
KiUserExceptionDispatcher,where it filters all exceptions like the 
previous version did. So the method of SEH/UEF protection is the same as
described in Protty1. What is the main difference? Main difference is that
current mechanism do not emulate instruction and do not deprotect regions.
It works in completely different way. When some instruction (assume it is
GOOD - stored in not writeable location) tries to access protected region
it causes access violation. Why so? Because if you remember the ascii 
schemas most of them point to DECOY (which is not accessible memory) or 
to a minus memory location (invalid one). This causes an exception, 
normally as described earlier the mechanism should de-prot the locations
and emulate the intruction, but not in this case. Here we are checking 
what registers were used by the instruction which caused fault, and then
by scanning them we are checking if any of them points somewhere inside
"DECOYS" offsets.

How the mechanism know whats registers are used by instruction!?
----------------------------------------------------------------
To understand how the prevention mechanism works, the reader should
know about so called "opcode decoding", this !IS NOT! the full tutorial
but it describes the main things reader should know (for more check
www.intel.com or [8]). I would also like to thank Satish K.S for 
supporting me with great information which helped me to make the 
"tutorial" suitable for human beings (chEERs ricy! :))

The instructions from Intel Architecture are encoded by using subsets of 
the general machine instruction format, like here:

 									
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 A                 A                 A     * * *       A                 A
 A 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 A 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 A 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 A 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 A
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
   A A A A A A A A   A A A A A A A A   A A A A A A A A   A A A A A A A A
   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
                   A                          A                 A
                   A                          A                 A
                Opcode                    ModR/M Byte        SIB Byte
             1 or 2 Bytes         


Each instruction consists of an Opcode, a Register and/or Address mode 
specifier (if required) consisting of the ModR/M byte and sometimes the 
scale -index-base (SIB) byte, a displacement (if required), and an 
immediate data field (if required).

Z0mbies ADE32 engine can disassembly every instruction and return the 
DISASM structure which provides information useful for us. 
Here is the structure:


struct disasm_struct
{
 IN OUT BYTE  disasm_defaddr;       -- specify 4 for 32-bit code
 IN OUT BYTE  disasm_defdata;       -- specify 4 for 32-bit code
 OUT DWORD    disasm_len;           -- total length of opcode or 0
 OUT DWORD    disasm_flag;          -- bitset of C_xxx
 OUT DWORD    disasm_addrsize;      -- size of address (or 0 if no addr)
 OUT DWORD    disasm_datasize;      -- size of data    (or 0 if no data)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_rep;           -- REP prefix value (if C_REP)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_seg;           -- SEG prefix value (if C_SEG)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_opcode;        -- opcode value (present if no error)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_opcode2;       -- 2nd opcode value (if C_OPCODE2)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_modrm;         -- MODRM value (if C_MODRM)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_sib;           -- SIB value (if C_SIB)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_addr[8];       -- address (if disasm_addrsize!=0)
 OUT BYTE     disasm_data[8];       -- data (if disasm_datasize!=0)
};


To get the registers used by the instruction, we need to check the
disasm_modrm value. Of course there are few exceptions like one-bytes 
intructions (no ModR/M) like "lodsb/lodsw/stosb" etc.etc. Protty2 is doing
manual check for them. Sometimes encoding of the ModR/M requires a SIB 
byte to fully specify the addressing form. The base+index and scale+index
forms of a 32bit addressing require the SIB byte. This, due to lack of 
free time, wasn't implemented in P2, however when the mechanism cannot find
the "registers used" it does some brute-scan and check all registers in
host context (this should cover most of the unknown-cases).


But lets go back to ModR/M-s:

Lets imagine we are disassembling following instruction:
- MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EBX]

The value returned in disasm_modrm is equal to 03h. By knowing this the
library checks following table (look for 03):

As you can see 03h covers "[EBX], EAX/AX/AL". And that's the thing we 
needed.Now mechanism knows it should scan EAX and EBX registers and update
them if their values are "similiar" to address of "DECOYS". Of course the
register checking method could be more efficient (should also check more
opcodes etc. etc.) - maybe in next versions.

In the mechanism i have used the table listed above, anyway there is also
"another" ("primary") way to determine what registers are used. The way is
based on fact that ModR/M byte contains three fields of information (Mod,
Reg/Opcode, R/M). By checking bits of those entries we can determine what
registers are used by the instruction (surely interesting tables from
Intel manuals: "...Addressing Forms with the ModR/M Byte") I'm currently
working on disassembler engine, so all those codes related to "opcode 
decoding" topic should be released in the nearest future. And probably if
Protty project will be continued i will exchange the z0mbie dissassembler
engine with my own, anyway his baby works very well. 

If you are highly interrested in disassembling the instructions, check the
[8].



To see how it works, check following example:

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------	
	mov   eax,fs:[30h]
	mov   eax,[eax+0ch]
	mov   esi,[eax+1ch] 	; value changed by protector,ESI=DDDDDDDDh
	lodsd			; load one dword <- causes exception		
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

This example faults on "lodsd" instruction, because application is trying
to load 4 bytes from invalid location - ESI  (because it was changed by 
P2). 

Prevention library takeovers the exception and checks the instruction. 
This one is "lodsd" so instead of ModR/M byte (because there is no such
here) library checks the opcode. When it finds out it is "lodsd" 
instruction, it scans and updates ESI. Finally the ESI (in this case) is
rewritten to 0241F28h (original) and the execution is continued including
the "BAD" instruction.

So that's how P2 works, a lot faster then its older brother P1.


--[ VI.   Action - few samples of catched shellcodes

If you have studied descriptions of all of the mechanisms, it is
time to show where/when Protty prevents them.

Lets take a look at examples of all mechanisms described in paragraph IV.

PEB (Process Environment Block) parsing
---------------------------------------

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	mov eax,dword ptr fs:[30h]	; EAX is now PEB base
	mov eax,dword ptr [eax+0ch]	; EAX+0Ch = PEB_LDR_DATA

	mov esi,dword ptr [eax+1ch]	; get the first entry
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
               |
                ---- [P1-I1]

	mov ebx,[esi+08h]		; EBX=ntdll imagebase
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		|	
		 ------- [P2-I1]

	<rest code of PEB parser>
	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------


- Description for P1

In this example Protty catches the shellcode when the instruction marked
as [P1-I1] is executed. Since Protty has protected the PEB_LDR_DATA
region (it's marked as PAGE_NOACCESS) all references to it will
cause an access violation which will be filtered by Protty.
Here, shellcode is trying to get first entry from PEB_LDR_DATA structure,
this causes an exception and this way shellcode is catched - attack
failed.


- Description for P2


The mechanism is being activated when [P2-I1] instruction is being
executed. ESI value is redirected to invalid location so every
reference to it cause an access violation exception, this is
filtered by the installed prevention mechanism - in short words:
attack failed, shellcode was catched.



searching for kernel in memory
------------------------------

I think here code is not needed, anyway when/where protty will act in
this case? As you probably remember from paragraph IV the 
kernel search code works together with SEH (structured exception handler)
frame. Everytime shellcode tries invalid location SEH frame handles the
exception and the search procedure is continued. When Protty is active
shellcode doesn't have any "second chance" - what does it mean? It means
that when shellcode will check invalid location (by using SEH) the 
exception will be filtered by Protty mechanism, in short words shellcode
will be catched - attack failed.

There are also some shellcodes that search the main shellcode in memory
also using SEH frames. Generally the idea is to develop small shellcode
which will only search for the main one stored somewhere in memory. Since
here SEH frames are also used, such type of shellcodes will be also 
catched.



export section parsing 
----------------------

We are assuming that the attacker has grabbed the imagebase in unknown
way :) (full code in IV-th chapter - i don't want to past it here)


	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	; EAX=imagebase of kernel32.dll

	xor ebp,ebp		      ; zero the counter
	mov ebx,[eax+3ch]	      ; get pe header
	add ebx,eax		      ; normalize

	<...snip...>

	loop_it:
	mov edi,[ecx]                 ; get one name
	add edi,eax                   ; normalize
	cmp dword ptr [edi+4],'Acor'  ; is it GetP-rocA-ddress ?? :)
	jne @l                        ; nope -> jump to @l

	                              ; yes it is
	add esi,ebp	              ; add out counter
	mov esi,[esi]                 ; get the address
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              |
               ---[I1]

	add esi,eax	              ; normalize
	int 3	                      ; ESI=address of GetProcAddress

	@l:
	<...snip...>

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

- Description for P1 and P2

Following example is being catched when [I1] instruction is being
executed - when it tries to read the address of GetProcAddress
from array with function addresses. Since function addresses array
is "protected" all references to it will cause access
violation exception, which will be filtered by the mechanism (like in
previous points). Shellcode catched, attack failed.


import section parsing 
----------------------


	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------
	;following example gets LoadLibraryA address from IAT

	IMAGEBASE 		equ 00400000h 

	mov ebx,IMAGEBASE
	mov eax,ebx
	add eax,[eax+3ch]                     ; PE header

	mov edi,[eax+80h]                     ; import RVA
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              |
               ----[I1]

	add edi,ebx                           ; normalize
	xor ebp,ebp

	mov edx,[edi+10h]                     ; pointer to addresses
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              |
               ----[I2]

	add edx,ebx                           ; normalize

	<...snip...>

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

- Description for P1 and P2

After instruction marked as [I1] is executed, EDI should contain the 
import section RVA, why should? because since the protection is 
active import section RVA is faked. In next step (look at instruction
[I2]) this will cause access violation exception (because of the fact
that FAKED_IAT_RVA + IMAGEBASE = INVALID LOCATION) and the shellcode
will be catched. Attack failed also in this case.

There is also a danger that attacker can hardcode IAT RVA. For such
cases import section array of function names is also protected.
Look at following code:

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

	<...snip...>

	@loop:
	mov eax,[esi]
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		|
	         --[I1]

	add eax,ebx
	add eax,2
	cmp dword ptr [eax],'daoL'            ; is this LoadLibraryA?

	<...snip...>

	;----------SNIP--------------------------------------------

Instruction [I1] is trying to access memory which is not accessible 
(protection mechanism changed it) and in the result of
this exception is generated. Protty filters the access violation
and kills the shellcode - this attack also failed.

And the last example, some shellcode from metasploit.com:

[!!-P1] - protty (P1) takeovers the program execution when instruction
          at 0012FDE7h (MOV ESI,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+1C]) is being
          executed, application is terminated, attack failed.

[!!-P2] - P2 works like above, but the execution is redirected when lodsd
	  instruction is executed.




--[ VII.  Bad points (what you should know) - TODO

I have tested Protty2 (P2) with: 

- Microsoft Internet Explorer
- Mozilla Firefox 
- Nullsoft Winamp
- Mozilla Thunderbird
- Winrar
- Putty 
- Windows Explorer

and few others applications, it worked fine with 2-5 module protected 
(the standard is 2 modules NTDLL.DLL and KERNEL32.DLL), with not much 
bigger CPU usage!  You can define the number of protected modules etc. 
etc. to make it suitable for your machine/software. The GOOD point is
that protected memory region is not requested all the time, generally
only on loading new modules (so it don't eat CPU a lot).

However there probably are applications which will not be working stable
with protty. I think decreasion of protection methods can make the 
mechanism more stable however it will also decrease the security level. 

Anyway it seems to be more stable than XP SP2 :)) I'm preparing for 
exams so I don't really have much time to spend it on Protty, so while 
working with it remember this is a kind of POC code.


TODO:

!!! DEFINETLY IMPORTANT !!! 

- add SEH all chain checker 

- code optimization, less code, more *speeeeeed *

- add vectored exception handling checker

- add some registry keys/loaders to inject it automatically to 
  started application

(if anybody want to play with Protty1):

- add some align calculation procedure for VirtualProtect, to describe 
  region size more deeply.

  Anyway I made SAFE_MEMORY_MODE (new!), here is the description:

  When protty reaches the point where it checks the memory region
  which caused exception, it checks if it's protected.

  Due to missing of align procedure for (VirtualProtect), Protty region 
  comparing procedure can be not stable (well rare cases :)) - and
  to prevent such cases i made SAFE_MEMORY_MODE.

  In this case Protty doesn't check if memory which caused exception
  is laying somewhere inside protected region table. Instead of this
  Protty gets actual protection of this memory address (Im using
  VirtualProtect - not the VirtualQuery because it fails on special
  areas). Then it checks that actual protection is set to 
  PAGE_NOACCESS if so, Protty deprotects all protected regions and
  checks the protection again, if it was changed it means that 
  requested memory lays somewhere inside of protected regions.
  The rest of mechanism is the same (i think it is even more
  better then align procedure, anyway it seems to work well)

  (you can turn on safe mode via editing the prot/conf.inc and rebuilding
  the library)


--[ VIII. Last words

In the end I would like to say there is a lot to do (this is a concept),
but I had a nice time coding this little thingie. It is based on pretty 
new ideas, new technology, new stuffs. This description is short and not 
well documented, like I said better test it yourself and see the effect. 
Sorry for my bad english and all the *lang* things. If you got any 
comments or sth drop me an email.
