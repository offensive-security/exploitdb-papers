                                                             March 1993


                         Recent Internet Books

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does

   unlimited.

Abstract

   This article originally appeared in Volume 2 Number 12, (December
   1992) of Matrix News, the monthly newsletter of Matrix Information
   and Directory Services, Inc. (MIDS).

1.  Which Books

   Here is a list of books related to using the Internet, which is the
   global and exponentially growing network of more than a million
   computers that communicate by interactive use of the TCP/IP
   protocols, for the use of millions of users.  This article was
   prompted by the recent publication of nine or ten books on the
   Internet in the space of a year (some are so new they aren't even
   published yet).  I have also included some books that have been
   around for quite a long time (as long ago as the dim past of 1984).
   I think all of them contain useful information for people new to the
   Internet.

   Some of the books included here are about more than the Internet.
   Some of them are about the Matrix, which is the set of all computer
   networks worldwide that exchange electronic mail.  The Matrix
   includes FidoNet, UUCP, BITNET, USENET, the Internet, and many
   others, but is not limited to any one of those networks.  This
   particular bibliographic collection is oriented around the largest
   computer network in the world, the Internet, because of all the
   recent books about that network.  Matrix News continues to publish
   information about the Matrix, including but not limited to the
   Internet.

                     Table 1. Network Books Summarized


   I have excluded from this article books that are solely about
   technical aspects of technology, such as the TCP/IP protocols.
   Instead, I have included books about the resources and users of the
   Internet.  I have grouped them in rough classifications for
   convenience of presentation.  Several of these books fit several
   classifications.  For that reason and others, the classifications
   should be taken as illustrative, not definitive.  Table 1 summarizes
   some features of all the books described.

   Thanks to various people for input; especially David Bridge.  Much of
   the detailed bibliographic information came from the Library of
   Congress catalog server supported by Digital Research Associates,
   Inc., accessed via gopher and Telnet over the Internet.

   Please note that prices may change, as may electronic mail addresses,
   telephone and fax numbers, and postal addresses.  The price you pay,
   in particular, may be less because of a discount, or more because of
   shipping, or because you buy the book outside of the United States.
   The information included here is accurate to the best of my
   knowledge, but your mileage may vary.  Use at your own risk.  But
   please do report errors, changes, and additions to mids@tic.com.

   Some bibliographic citations end in a line of the form

                  domain.name:path/name

   This means you can retrieve further information by connecting to
   domain.name with FTP, logging in as user anonymous, using your
   electronic mail address as a password, and changing to path/name as a
   directory, or retrieving it as a file, whichever works.

   Some citations end in a line of the form

                  local@domain

   This is a domain address for further email inquiries.


2.  Introductions

   New user guides and information on getting connected fill most of the
   new books about the Internet.

      LaQuey & Ryer:

               Tracy LaQuey, and Jeanne C. Ryer, The Internet
               Companion: A Beginner's Guide to Global
               Networking, p. 208, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA,
               October 1992.
               $10.95. ISBN 0-201-62224-6.
               Book Review: Internet Society News, 1(3):34.
               Summer 1992.
               Book Review: Link Letter, 5(3):4. Nov. 1992.
               Book Review: Matrix News, 2(9):8-9. Sept. 1992.
               companion@world.std.com

      This is the least expensive introductory guide for new users of
      the Internet, and perhaps the only one aimed at the general
      public.  It is also being made available online by anonymous FTP
      from world.std.com, two chapters a month.

      Kehoe:

               Brendan P. Kehoe, Zen and the Art of the Internet:
               A Beginner's Guide, p. 112, Prentice-Hall,
               Englewood Cliffs, NJ, July 1992.
               $22.00. ISBN 0-13-010778-6.
               Book Review: Link Letter, 5(3):3. Nov. 1992.
               Book Review: MicroTimes, 102:3, Nov. 23, 1992.
               simsc.si.edu:networks/zen.ad

      The first edition of this book was and is available only online,
      from various anonymous FTP servers.  This second edition is
      somewhat enlarged and updated, yet is still the shortest
      introductory Internet book.

      Krol:

               Ed Krol, The Whole Internet User's Guide &
               Catalog, p. 376, O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.,
               Sebastopol, CA, 13 September 1992.

               Book Review: MicroTimes, 102:3, Nov. 23, 1992.

      Perhaps the most ambitious of the new crop of books, this one is
      both a user's guide and a catalog of resources in one.  It is
      aimed at graduate students who want to use the Internet for
      research.

      Kochmer:

               Jonathan Kochmer, and NorthWestNet, The Internet
               Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World
               Online, 4th ed., p. 450, NorthWestNet, Bellevue,
               WA, 1993.
               $39.95. ISBN 0-9635281-0-6.
               info@nwnet.net

      A forthcoming guide and catalog, not yet seen.  It is
      paradoxically both the fourth edition of and the successor to the
      other NorthWestNet book listed later.

      Marine:

               April Marine, ed., Internet: Getting Started, p.
               380, SRI International, Menlo Park, CA, September
               1992.
               $39.00.  ISBN [none].
               Book Review: Internet Society News, 1(3):33.
               Summer 1992.
               Book Review: Link Letter, 5(3):4. Nov. 1992.
               Book Review: Matrix News, 2(12). Dec. 1992.
               ftp.nisc.sri.com:netinfo/internet-getting-
               started-contents

      How to join the Internet, and some context so you will know why.
      This book is not a guide, and not a catalog, but it does contain
      numerous contact listings.

      Dern:

               Daniel P. Dern, The New User's Guide to the
               Internet, McGraw-Hill, New York, forthcoming in
               1993.  ISBN 0-07-016510-6 (hc). ISBN 0-07-16511-4
               (pbk).

      A forthcoming new user guide, not yet seen.

      Lane & Summerhill:

               Elizabeth S. Lane, and Craig A. Summerhill, An
               Internet Primer for Information Professionals: A
               Basic Guide to Networking Technology, p. 200,
               Meckler Corp., Westport, CT, forthcoming in 1992.
               $37.50. ISBN 0-88736-831-X.

      This book, not yet seen, is apparently aimed at information
      professionals, presumably meaning librarians and others.


3.  Travelogs

   This category has only one book in it so far.

      Malamud:

               Carl Malamud, Exploring the Internet: A Technical
               Travelogue, p. 376, Prentice-Hall, Englewood
               Cliffs, NJ, August 1992.
               $26.95. ISBN 0-13-296898-3.
               Book Review: Internet Society News, 1(3):34.
               Summer 1992.
               Book Review: Network Computing, 3(11):46. October
               15, 1992.
               Book Review: Matrix News, 2(9):9,11. Sept. 1992.

      Many fine lunches and dinners with users, administrators, and
      developers of the Internet in many countries around the world,
      with accurate technical background.  Certainly the most wickedly
      funny of all the books about the Internet.  Contains a subplot
      about how and why ITU and ISO do not publish their standards
      online.


4.  Standards

   The seemingly obscure topic of standards is actually illuminating
   when the subject is Internet Standards, because the processes that
   produce them reflect how the whole network works: by the efforts of
   its users and engineers.

      Quarterman & Wilhelm:

               John S. Quarterman, and Susanne Wilhelm, UNIX,
               POSIX, and Open Systems: The Open Standards
               Puzzle, p. 446, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1993.
               $42.50. ISBN 0-201-52772-3.
               Book Review: Internet Society News, 1(3):34.
               Summer 1992.

      Context about open systems standards.  Includes a very brief
      history of the Internet, comments on the effects of networks on
      standards and the reverse, commentary on the benefits of
      publishing standards online, and an in-depth examination of the
      IETF standards process used to produce Internet Standards.  Also
      includes an Internet growth graph.

      Lynch & Rose:

               Daniel C. Lynch and Marshall T. Rose, eds., The
               Internet System Handbook, p. 822, Addison-Wesley,
               Reading, MA, 1993.  $40, ISBN 0-201-56741-5.

      A description of the process that produces Internet Standards, and
      some other user level material in addition to protocol material.


5.  Textbooks

   This category includes a textbook on using the Internet, and some
   other books that could be used as textbooks for sociology or policy.

      Tennant:

               Roy Tennant, John Ober, Anne G. Lipow, and
               Foreword by Clifford Lynch, Crossing the Internet

      Includes the entire text of the High Performance Computing Act
      (HPCA) of 1991 that authorized the forthcoming National Research
      and Education Network (NREN), as well as numerous examinations of
      what it does and should mean.  Papers from a workshop at Harvard's
      Kennedy School of Government.  Tough sledding in spots, but very
      rewarding in others.

6.  Hacking and Cracking

   Hacking is skillful programming.  Cracking is breaking and entering.
   If you don't know the difference, read the first two books below.  If
   you don't think it matters, read the last book below, which examines
   how law enforcement agencies confused about computers and networks
   did some very strange things.

      Levy:

               Steven Levy, Hackers: Heroes of the Computer
               Revolution, p. 473, Anchor Press/Doubleday, Garden

               $4.95 ISBN 0-440-13405-6 (pbk).

      Tales of the real hackers who invented the modern computer
      industry.  Some of these people are still quite active on the nets
      today.

      Raymond & Steele:

      Internet Worm.  Also includes information on viruses.  Has quite a
      bit of material on the cultures of the networks, and on social,
