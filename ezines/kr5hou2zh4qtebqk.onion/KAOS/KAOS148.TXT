40Hex Number 6 Volume 2 Issue 2                                     File 000


    Welcome to 40Hex issue 6.  If this is your first time reading an issue of
40 Hex, I welcome you, but recommend that you start with an earlier issue.
This issue will have a Virus Spotlite on Creeping Death(Dir-2).  It isn't in
the normal Hex Dump format, and it is fully commented.

- Landfill is temporarily down(again!).  This is due to several [NuKEd]
  hard drive controllers... we are down but NOT out. Hopefully we should be
  up within several weeks of the release of this issue.  Hellraiser is still
  unable to edit the magazine, hopefully next issue he will be back in
  charge.

- I think we must discuss one problem.  Recently, we have been verbally
  "attacked" by some lamers in the virus scene who like to jerk off on
  Fidonet.  To clear up the issue at hand, we personally don't use all of
  the methods found in the articles.  For example, we don't sit around all
  day and PKLite infected files and then remove the PKLite header.  We let
  you people do it.  As a matter of fact, we made it a hell of a lot easier
  due to this month's article called NoLite.  No self-respecting virus
  group would do it.  Not everyone that reads this magazine is a virus
  programmer, but wants to learn.  Ya gotta start somewhere.  Another person
  who has been insulting us on FidoNet is Sara Gordon.  I do not know the
  whole story behind her hatred, but I know it stems from a phone
  conversation between her and Hellraiser.  From what I understand, they
  disagreed on many topics, and HR may have gotten insulting (I don't
  know the whole story)

- Anyone that would like to submit articles feel free to do so, as long as
  what you write is not stolen from another source and is of good quality.
  If you would like to write articles contact any PHALCON/SKISM member or
  upload them to either Digital Warfare or PHUN LINE.

                    Memory Resident Anti-Virus Detection
                              and Removal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of ways to see if anti-viral utils are present in memory.
I got the list out of PC interupts, a book by Ralph Brown.  Here they are:

F.-DRIVER.SYS (Part of the F-Protect virus package by Fridrik Skulason.)
              This program "grabs" the INT 21 monitoring code, if it was not
              already taken by another program.
              INT 21h, Function 4Bh, Sub Function EEh
              AX must = 4BEEh at call, and call returns AX=1234h if F-Prot
              sucessfully grabbed INT 21, and AX=2345h if the grab failed.

F-DLOCK.SYS  (A HD access restrictor, part of F-Protect Package)
              Call INT 2Fh, Funct. 46h, SubFunct 53h
              At call, AX must = 4653h, CX=0005h, BX= 0000h
              If present in ram, AX will return FFFFh.  To uninstall, call
              with AX & CX the same as above, but BX= 0001h.  AX, ES, & BX
              will be destroyed.

F-LOCK.EXE  (Part of F-Protect package, looks for "suspicious" activity)
            INT 2Fh, Funct 46h, SubFunct. 53h
            To call:  AX = 4653h, CX=0002h, BX=0000h (installation check)
                                            BX=0001h (uninstall)
                                            BX=0002h (disable v1.08 & below)
                                            BX=0003h (enable v1.08 & below)
            Call returns AX=FFFFh if installed ( BX=0000h at call)
            AX, BX, and ES destroyed, if uninstalled (BX=0001 at call)

F-POPUP.EXE (Pop up menu for F-Protect)
          INT 2Fh, Funct. 46h, SubFunct. 53h
          To call: AX=4653h, CX=0004h, BX= 0000h, 0001h or 0002h
                                       (See above - BX same as F-Lock)
          Returns: Same as F-LOCK.EXE

F-XCHK.EXE (Prevents execution of any progs which don't have self-checking
            code added by F-XLOCK)
           INT 2Fh, Funct. 46h, SubFunct 53h
           To Call: Registers = same as F-Popup, except CX=0003h, and
                    BX = 0000h (installation check) or 0001h (uninstall)
           Returns: same as F-LOCK, above.

TBSCANX (Resident Virus scanning Util by Frans Veldman)
        INT 2Fh, Function CAh, SubFunct 00h
        Call: AX=CA01, BX=5442h ("TB")
        Returns: AL=00h if not installed, AL=FFh if installed
                 BX=7462h ("tb") if BX was 5442h during call

        INT 2Fh, Function CAh, Subfunction 02h (Set state of TBSCANX)
        Call: AX=CA02h, BL = new state (00h=disabled, 01h=enabled)

VDEFEND (Part of PC-tools.  Works on v7.0)
        INT 21h, Function FAh
        To call: AH=FAh, DX=5945h, AL=subfunction (01h to uninstall)
        returns: CF set on error, DI = 4559h (?)

DATAMON (PC Tools 7.0 file protection)
        INT 2Fh, Funct 62h, Sub Funct 84h
        Call: AX=6284h, BX=0000h (for installation check), CX=0000h
        Returns: AX=resident code segment, BX & CX = 5555h

Flu Shot, or Virex PC
        INT 21h
        Call: AX=0ff0fh
        Returns if either is installed: AX=101h

If anyone has any more Anti-Viral IDs, post 'em on Digital Warfare and I'll
update this list.

Concealment:      Keep Your Code Hidden From Prying Eyes
                                        by Demogorgon/PHALCON/SKISM


  Recently, I have been experimenting with a few new programming techniques
that should be of great interest to the virus writing community. It is always
our top priority to keep our code out of the hands of lamers in order to
prevent the dreaded 'text change' and above all, to cause the anti-virus
community as much grief as possible. In order to do this, we must put a great
deal of effort into concealing our code.  That is the focus of this article.

This file is divided into two parts.  The first part is devoted to developing
'debug resistant' code, and the second part deals with defeating disassem-
blers.  I will not cover encryption, because methods of encryption are
commonly known and there is really not much further I can go with that.
For a complete review of self encryption methods, take a look at Dark Angel's
Funky Virus Writing Guide (number three, the one that hasn't been released
yet.)

Part_I: The debugger is NOT your friend

     The basic idea behind writing debug ressistant code is finding a way to
make your code behave differently when it runs under a debugger.  With a real
mode debugger, this is simplicity itself.  All that is necessary is a little
knowledge of how a debugger works.  A debugger, such as debug or TD traces
through a program by setting handlers to int 1 and int 3.  These are called
after every instruction is executed.  A virus that wishes to avoid being
debugged can simply replace the handlers for these interrupts, and the
results will be just about whatever you want.  Here is some code to do this:

eat_debug:
        push    cs
        pop     ds
        mov     dx, offset eat_int
        mov     ax,2501h
        int     21h
        mov     al,03h
        int     21h
        ...                     ;rest of code
eat_int: iret

  As you can see, this requires minimal space in your code, and is certainly
worth the effort.  You can experiment by placing something else at 'eat_int'.
Another commonly used tactic is to disable the keyboard interrupt while
certain parts of the code are being executed.  This will surely keep lamers
baffled, though a pro would recognize what was going on immediately.  I am
sure McAfee's programmer's scoff at code such as this.  Also note that while
this will defeat the average real mode debugger, any protected mode debugger
will step through this as if it weren't there.  Playing with interrupts will
not help you when your program will be running in a virtual cpu anyway.  One
method I found which will work nicely against td386 is to throw in a hlt
instruction.  This will give TD an exception 13 error, and terminate the
program.  Anyone who is aware of this will just step over a hlt instruction,
so therefore methods must be used to conceal its presence, or to make it a
necessary part of the code.  This will be covered in part II.

  Another trick you can play is to call int3 within your program.  If
someone tries to run your program under a debugger, it will stop each time
int3 is called.  It is possible to trace through it, but it will be annoying
if there are many int3's thrown in.

Part_2: Kill your disassembler

  No matter how well you mess up debuggers, your program is entirely at the
mercy of a programmer armed with a good disassembler.  Unless, of course, you
use techniques that will confuse disassemblers.  My favorite method for
baffling them is to create code that overlaps.  Overlapping code may seem a
little bit too complicated for most of us at first, but with the knowledge of
a few instruction hex translations, you too can make effective overlapping
code without sacrificing too much code size.  Overlapping code can get as
complex as you would like, but this file will only deal with the simplest
examples.


eat_sr: mov     ax,02EBh
        jmp     $-2             ;huh?
        ...                     ;rest of code

This may confuse you at first, but it is fairly simple. The first instruction
moves a dummy value into ax.  The second instruction jmps into the value that
was just moved into ax. '02EB' translates into 'jmp $+2' (remember that words
are stored in reverse).  This jump goes past the first jmp, and continues on
with the code.  This will probably not be sufficient to defeat a good
disassembler like Sourcer, but it does demonstrate the technique. The problem
with this is that Sourcer may or may not just pick up the code after
commenting out the 'jmp $-2'.  It is difficult to predict how Sourcer will
respond, and it usually depends on the bytes that appear directly after the
jmp.  To severely baffle Sourcer, it is necessary to do some stranger things.
Take a look at this example.

erp:    mov     ax,0FE05h
        jmp     $-2h
        add     ah,03Bh
        ...                     ;rest of code

This code is quite a bit more useful than the previous listing.  Let us
simulate what would happen if we were to trace through this code, showing a
hex dump at each step to clarify things.

B8 05 FE EB FC 80 C4 3B   mov     ax,0FE05h       ;ax=FE05h
^^ ^^ ^^
B8 05 FE EB FC 80 C4 3B   jmp     $-2             ;jmp into '05 FE'
         ^^ ^^
B8 05 FE EB FC 80 C4 3B   add     ax,0EBFEh       ;05 is 'add ax'
   ^^ ^^ ^^
B8 05 FE EB FC 80 C4 3B   cld                     ;a dummy instruction
            ^^
B8 05 FE EB FC 80 C4 3B   add     ah,3Bh          ;ax=2503h
               ^^ ^^ ^^

   The add ah,03Bh is there simply to put the value 2503h into ax. By adding
five bytes (as opposed to simply using 'mov ax,2503h') this code will confuse
disassemblers pretty well.  Even if the instructions are disassembled
properly, the value of ax will not be known, so every int call after this
point will not be commented properly, as long as you never move a value into
ax.  You can conceal the value from the disassembler by using 'add ax' or
'sub ax' whenever possible.

   If you examine this closely, you can see that any value can be put into
ax.  Two of the values can be changed to whatever you want, namely the FE in
the first line, and the 3B in the last line.  It is helpful to debug through
this chunk of code to determine what values should be placed here in order to
make ax what you would like it to be.

   Back to the subject of killing debuggers, it is very sneaky to hide
something like a hlt instruction inside another instruction, such as a jmp.
For example, take a look at this:

glurb:  mov     cx,09EBh
        mov     ax,0FE05h ;-\
        jmp     $-2       ;  >--this should look familiar to you
        add     ah,03Bh   ;-/
        jmp     $-10
        ...             ;rest of code

The three lines in the middle are a repeat of the previous example.  The
important part of this code is the first line and the 'jmp $-10'.  What
happens is, the jmp goes back into the 'mov cx' instruction.  The '09EB'
translates into 'jmp $+9'.  This lands in the '$-10' part of the first jmp.
The $-10 just happens to be stored as 0F4h, the hlt instruction.  By making
the hlt part of another instruction, it is not visible when it is being
traced through by td386.  It is also not possible to remove it without
altering the code.

   The purpose of this article is not to supply code to be thrown into your
own programs.  The purpose is to get you to think about new ways to avoid
having your code looked at and modified by others.  The most important thing
is to be original.  It is pointless for you to simply duplicate this code,
because anyone else who has read this file will already know what you are
trying to do.

                END     concealment

40Hex Number 6 Volume 2 Issue 2                                    File 003


    Well, there have been plenty of busts in 1992 so here is the run down
to the best of my knowledge for anyone who is interested:

Asphi: Busted by MCI on January 20 for hacking on 476's. Had to pay $2700 for
       the phone calls he made.  From what I found out MCI Wants to nail him
       to the wall.  Charges include: Unlawful use of a computer, Credit Card
       Fraud, Theft of Services, Criminal Conspiracy and some more I can't
       think of, 10 or so total.  And of course they took his system.  He is
       going to have a trial, but a date has not yet been set.

Axiom Codex:  Billed $2000 for equal access codes.

Cold Steel:  Billed $40.00 for 476's

Count Zero: Yet another that got nailed for 476's.  Billed $86.63 and had to
            tell his parents.

Deathblade:  Billed $100 for 476's.

Dekion: Also nailed for 476's.  Not sure if he will be charged.  Billed
        somewhere between $100 - $1000.

Genghas Khan: Nailed for CBI and for 733's.  Not sure about what will happen
              to him, but I heared from his friend that he is really screwed.

Instigator:  I got nailed in the 476 ring too.  They took my system but gave
             it back.  I got billed for $1970.17.  I got charged with 1 count
             of Theft of services.  They dropped the other 8 charges.  I am
             going to be on informal probation for a short period.

Marauder:  Raided last year by GBI, they took his computer equipment and
           never gave it back.  They finally decided to charge him with
           some misdemeanors.

Netrunner:   Billed $100 for 476's.

Terminal:  Arrested same time as Genghas Kahnvict.  He is NOT a minor...

VenoM:  476's again.  Billed $75.00 and had to tell his parents.

*** AND the LAMEST bust of the month award goes to:

DecimatoR - for sitting in his car along a main road while using the beige
box!  He ran up a wopping $0.81 phone bill before the cop came by and asked
him  if he was having car trouble and saw the wires running from the car
into the telephone pole.  He was arrested, then released. No charges have
been filed.... yet!

*** AND the second LAMEST bust of the month award goes to:

Hot Rize - for wizely running his neighbors phone line into his own house.
No one would notice that one, eh?  We also recieved confirmed reports that
he is a dweeb.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All 4 PHALCON/SKISM joints went down between January and March.  The Landfill
for security reasons, Digital Warfare because of me getting busted, PHUN LINE
for security reasons, and USSR because Time Lord may be getting busted.
Digital Warfare went back up though, with DecimatoR as sysop.

**  Apparently the head of the 476 operations is Terry Oakes. He is the phone
    Fraud investigator in charge of the TeleConnect Investigations.  Give him
    a ring at 800-476-1234 Ext. 3045.  Thank you.

**  References to 476's are refering to 800-476-9696 owned by Teleconnect, a
    subsidary of MCI. (6 Digit Calling Cards  - Get a LAMER to hack 'em)

**  Make sure you change your passwords if you use the same one on Digital
    Warfare as you do on other boards.  They have the OLD user list.

**  Additions to the list will be on a first busted first added basis.

40Hex Number 6 Volume 2 Issue 2                                    File 004

                              NOLITE v1.0
                             By DecimatoR
                            of PHALCON/SKISM
                      PD War Collection Program 1

This program will remove the PKLITE header from .EXE and .COM for
two reasons.

A) To make the file un-decompressable, which dosen't mean much if
   you have the registered version of PKLITE.

B) More importantly, makes the PKLITEd file unscannable to virus
   scanners, such as McAfees' Virus Scan etc...

Does this by overwriting the header with random text from memory.

Parameters are simple:

NOLITE filename.ext (Extension MUST be included!)

Will remove the header from PKLITEd files.  It will not remove the
header if it is not a genuine PKLITE file.

Note:  This program is based on PKSMASH, which was written by Hellraiser.
            Unfortunately, a bug surfaced in that program, which caused it
            to lock up sometimes.  So I wrote this to replace PKSMASH, and
            stole HR's dox.  <sorry dude>

                                                   ---DecimatoR

Cut out the following code, call it NOLITE.HEX, then DEBUG < NOLITE.HEX
