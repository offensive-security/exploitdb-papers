40Hex Number 5 Volume 2 Issue 1                                     File 000

        Welcome to Issue 5 of 40Hex, the monthy semi-annual magazine
published for all those interested in learning more about computer viruses.

        Lots of new news:

1) Well, Hellraiser has lost computer and housing temporarily, so DecimatoR
   had taken over the magazine.  There has been so much new stuff, a lot got
   changed since the time I received this issue.  Special BIG ASS greets to
   him for all of his work on this issue.
2) Digital Warfare is down, as Instigator got busted for phreaking.  We will
   let you know more when we know more.  Before its demise, its virus
   collection had grown incredibly, thus stocking 40Hex for life.
3) LandFill BBS went back up. I am back in the scene again.  Give it a ring.
4) As of the release of this file, I have heard of more busts, specifically,
   Gengis Kahn and Rain Man.... could be rumor.

   BTW, for those of you who have the "Anti-FiRe" virus, SCAN 86 catches
   it as "Infinity"... probably due to the text it contains.  Course, it was
   distributed on a VGA loader for the InFiniTy boards... heh heh heh...

                         Instigator --- Busted!

At 2:40 pm EST, Jan 20, '92 a local cop pulled Instigator (me) out of my very
entertaining Social Studies class and informed me he, 1 other local cop and
2 MCI phone fraud investigators were gonna serve a warrant on my house and
confiscate my computer shit.  So the cop takes me to my house and they start
disassembling all of my computer stuff, and take all of my notes and shit.
They filmed all this.  They informed me I would be charged with theft of
services, credit card fraud and a bunch of other shit, like 3 felonys and
5 misdimeanors till they were done.  Anyways its about a week and a half
after the incident now and they only formally charged me with theft of
services.  So the worst that is gonna happen is I will get 1 year of
probation.  The best thing is they are thinking of only giving me a citation
or totally dropping the charges.  I am suppose to get my system back after
the DA comes to my house so I can show him how I did it.  As for Digital
Warfare I wanna give to someone to set up.  Anyway I made it to the front
page of 3 local newspapers so here is one of the articles:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

               (Shit inside the ***( )*** are my comments)

                       From the front page of the
                         Intelligencer Journal

               2 "Hackers" caught stealing phone service

  Using sophisticated computers and telephones, two Lancaster County
computer hackers touched MCI, a Washington-based telephone communications
network, for approximately $4,700 last year. ***( Sophisticated phones? )***

  Their activities represent "only the tip of the iceberg" of
telecommunications fraud, which carries an annual $1 billion to $1.5 billion
price tag, according to John Houser, a MCI spokesman. ***( Dick )***

  The two are accused of accessing MCI's computer and obtaining "25 card
numbers, thet we know about," Houser said.  "We know they made calls all over
the United Sates, to Canada, Great Britain, and West Germany"

  "None of the card numbers have been issued to Lancaster subscribers,"
Houser said.

  Columbia police are charging an 18 year old borough resident with credit
card fraud, unlawful use of a computer, theft of services, and criminal
conspiracy according to Sgt. C. Joseph Smith. Police are withholding his
identity until he is formally charged, Smith said.

  West Donegal Township chief Charles R. Bronte said a fifteen year old
suspect ***( that's me! )*** living in his jurisdiction was being refered to
juvenile authorities by the department investigator, Cpl. Kenton Whitebread.

  Officers with both departments said this was an entirely new kind of
criminal case for them.

  "I'm still going over our suspectes statement," said Smith, "and even when
I'm done, I don't think I'm going to understand (all the technical jargon).
We're getting a lot of help from MCI."

  "If our juvenile hadn't cooperated, it's possible we'd still be looking at
his equipment", Bronte said.  "He went into the computer, using his access
codes," ***( He means I logged on my board )*** " to retrieve the information
necessary to continue the investigation".

  Police confiscated computer telephone equipment, whose value is estimated
***( Estimated - Gimme a break!)***  in the thousands of dollars, when they
executed search warrants at the residences of both suspects, Jan. 20.

  "It was a real United Nations collection," said Bronte, "There were a
number of different manufacturers" of the equipment taken in West Donegal.
***( United Nations collection? )***

  Most of the equipment taken in Columbia was made by Tandy, Smith said.

  Both posessed programs and equipment which allowed their computers to
generate thousands of random numbers.

  Houser said that once an individual had knowledge of MCI's calling card
format "they could access our computer switching equipment, and begin
generating random numbers. ***( they make it sound so technical )*** They
could allow their equipment to run 24 hours a day."

  Houser declined discussing the company security, but acknowledged "We
became aware of an unusual number of calls coming into our computer line. We
eventually were able to trace those calls back to the originating telephone
equipment." ***( ANI )***

   Bronte said MCI investigators arrived at his department early Monday
afternoon.  The warrant was executed at 2 pm, Bronte said.  "We took
investigators to the suspects home, while Cpl. Whitebread picked up the
boy at his school.

     Smith said the Columbia warrant was served at 5:18pm on Monday.
The suspect and another individual were working on his computer at the time.
"They weren't doing anything illegal," he said.

     Smith said MCI first became aware of the two local hackers "about
Dec. 14".  They were monitoring them since."

     The officers said they did not believe either of the two profited
from their activities. ***( Free Phone calls! )***

     "I think it was just a case of him getting involved in someting that
was entirely over his head, Bronte said.  ***( Yeah, right )***

     Houser said MCI's investigation was continuing.

     "We have reason to believe they shared some of their information with
others," he said. "At this time I can tell you we have no other suspects in
Pennsylvania, but that could change tomorrow."

     He said investigators were unsure at present if any of the computer
data had been transmitted to other hackers. ***( They said one paragraph up
that they thought we shared some of the information.. Duh )***

    Update --
    ++++++

  Here is the current casualties on the 476-9696 system, which is owned by
  TeleConnect, a subsidiary of MCI.

   Apparently the head of the operations is Terry Oakes.  He is the phone
   Fraud investigator in charge of the TeleConnect Investigations.  Give him
   a ring at 800-476-1234 Ext. 3045.  Thank you.

(*) In both cases parents were notified.

                           Virus Spotlight:
                       The Ambulance Car Virus

Here's a debug script of the Ambulance Car virus.  I've tested the virus
created from this, and it works.  Ambulance Car is a parasitic, non-resident
.COM infector.  It spreads rapidly, and has one of the neatest graphic
displays that I've seen yet in a virus.  When it activates, a little ambulance
drives across the bottom of the screen, from left to right, and a siren is
heard over the PC speaker.  Other than that, all this thing does is replicate.

To create the virus from the debug script, cut between the dotted lines and
type:

                               The 1963 Virus

        Here's a debug script of 1963.  It's classified as an overwriting
virus, but it attaches the code it overwrites onto the end of the file it
infects...  so it overwrites, but it doesn't.  Sort of.

                           Forty Hex 5
                            Presents

                    An Alliance Interview with
                     John McAfee + Jon Dvorak
                               and
                 Hellraiser, Garbageheap, DecimatoR,
                  Count Zero, CRoW MeiSTeR, Instigator,
                   Demogorgon, Dark Angel, Night Crawler,
                    VenoM, Time Lord, Darkman.

On Feb. 2nd of 1992, an alliance was run with members of PHALCON/SKISM,
NuKE, and Ex-RABiD.  We started the conference by trying to call Patti
Hoffman, who had a shit fit, and denied being the author of VSUM.  Nice
of her to insult our intelligence.  But anyways, we then called McAfee,
who was surprisingly a nice guy.  He was interested in what we had to say.
Some of the topics covered were which viruses we had written, what types
of viri they were(i.e. MemRes, Stealth...).  Another important topic
covered the Bob Ross Virus which an associate of McAfee had misnamed the
Beta Virus(it was first spread on a false version of BNU(1.90Beta)).

On the following day, we started a second alliance, this time involving
Count Zero, CRoW MeiSTeR, Dark Angel, Demogorgon, Garbageheap(moi!),
Hellraiser, Instigator, Night Crawler and Time Lord.  Also in the
conference were John Markoff(New York Times), Michael Alexander(Computer
World), and John McAfee.  A variety of topics were covered, I won't go into
specifics here, because in a future issue we will have a full transcript,
and in this issue we will have the article from the Feb. 10,1992 Vol.XXVI
No. 6 issue of COMPUTERWORLD.

CHALLENGE, NOTORIETY CITED AS IMPETUS FOR VIRUS DEVELOPERS(*Catchy title*)
                    By: Michael Alexander/CW STAFF

     What motivates a programmer to write a virus?  The thrill, declared
Hell Raiser,(* that is supposed to be Hellraiser *) a self-styled virus
author and a member of Phalcon/Skism, a group of about a dozen computer
hackers scattered across North America.

     In an unusual telephone conference call to COMPUTERWORLD last week, 10
callers who said they were members of Phalcon/Skism claimed to be
responsible for writing several of the viruses now on the
loose.(* CLAIMED?!?!?!!  Well, I suppose that he couldnt know if we were the
real McCoy *)

     To protect their identities, the callers used such handles as Garbage
Heap(* Grabbin' top billin'! *), Nightcrawler, Demogorgon, Dark Angel, and
Time Lord.  They said their ages range from 15 to 23 years old, although
COMPUTERWORLD could not independantly verify their identities.

GETTING ATTENTION
+++++++++++++++++

     The virus authors, as they called themselves, said they arranged the
teleconference to air their side of the story, and to talk about their
unorthadox and contradictory brand of computer ethics. (* Well... close,
we were real bored... of course, who wants to talk to bored virus
authors... *)  "For the most part, virus authors are seen as a lot more
malicious than we actually are," Garbage Heap said.

     His compatriots said they write viruses mainly for the thrill but
also for the challenge and the status it brings within the computer
underground.  The group said it is not interested in doing harm, and
seldom creates viruses that are deliberately designed to cause damage.
"It's sort of like graffiti  -  getting our name across  -  and damage
happens in the process," he claimed.(* Hellraiser *)

     As an example of the type of virus they write, the group took credit
for writing the Bob Ross Virus, named after the painter of the same name on
who hosts a show on Public Broadcasting Service.

     "What it does is infect files and randomly displays 'Bobisms,' which
are messages Bob Ross would say," Hell Raiser said.  "It doesn't format
the hard drive or do any damage."

     However, other alleged members of Phalcon/Skism later admitted to
writing viruses that are clearly intended to damage or destroy programs
and data.(* Hellraiser again... *)

     The callers contended that they are virus "authors," not virus
"spreaders," and that they are not responsible for the problems their
creations cause.

     "The main difference is that an author may write a virus and may even
upload that virus to a virus board, a [bulletin Board system] oriented to
virus programmers and spreaders," one virus author explained.

     "People, like a disgruntled employee who may have a gripe with
someone else, download it and spread it that way," this virus author said.

NOT LAWBREAKERS
+++++++++++++++

     The virus authors also pointed out that since the act of writing a
virus is not prohibited by law, they should not be viewed as criminals.

     The callers claimed that even if the group stopped writing viruses,
the number of infections would not decline.  The problem of viruses has
grown so large that new viruses have no impact overall, one said.

     "Our effect is fairly little," he asserted.

     The callers said that they have been writing viruses for about a
year, and would probably continue for at least another year.  Eventually,
they hope to find jobs as full time programmers, several said.

     There is no way to verify the callers' claims.  However, many of the
monikers the callers used, as well as the name "Phalcon/Skism," have shown
up in perhaps as many as half  -  about 100  -  of the viruses to appear
in the past six or seven months, said John McAfee, president of McAfee
Associates, an antivirus software publisher based in Santa Clara,Calif.

     The quality of the viruses is "mediocre," Mcafee said. (* Cant win
'em all can we, John? *)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

My thoughts on the article was that it was neutral, Mr. Alexander could
have easily ripped us apart.  We didnt expect to come out looking like
heros, so why should we bitch.  Next month prepare for the official
transcript of the interview.  Then we can truly establish what was said.
