MEDIATION INFORMATION.


Introduction to meditation; CRASH COURSE IN INTRODUCTORY MEDITATION

Meditation is old and comes from India and China and places like that.
Basically western countries have developed a society based on accumulation
of things, while eastern countries, which are quite accumulated already,
have developed techniques for relaxing, and focusing, the mind to
appreciate what is already there.  As the U.S. becomes more overpopulated,
the need for relaxation techniques and self discovery through meditation
will become much more important.


Goal of meditation:
  Short Term: 
    Relaxation
  Long Term:
    To search for the true "self" by learning to control our perceptions.

Three "B"s
          Relax the body,
          Slow the blood flow,
          relax the brain.


Beginning Technique

        Find a comfortable sitting position. A lawn chair will do or
any chair pillow on the floor etc.  This is meditation, NOT yoga, so
don't go out and buy incense and shave your head just yet.

        Breathing is very important.  Breath slowly.  Pay close attention
to your breathing.  When you exhale, have your mind relax a specific part
of your body.  Exhale and physically realax your foot, then your leg, then
your arm, etc every time you exhale learn to relax a part of your body. This
step is easy and very interesting and beneficial to relieve stress. 

        Eyes closed.  Keep your eyes closed while learning to breath.
You will be seeing the inside of your eye lids of course, but work on
breathing. Breathing is good for your lympathic system. (body's sewage
system). 

        As you learn how easy it is to relax various parts of the body,
feeling the stress leave a specific body part as your breath leaves your
lungs, then move towards relaxing internal organs as well. Just as you
can exhale and relax your leg, work on exhaling and relaxing your internal
organs.  Your adrenal glands are in the back near the kidneys. Work on
those in paticular.  They are part of a feed back loop between the mind
and body that keeps us tense once we get tense, or keeps us depressed when
we get depressed.


         Once the body is relaxed, try relaxing the brain as well.
As you exhale "think of nothing" or "do not think". If you think of
"nothing" you may drive yourself mad, perhaps "do not think" is a better
term for western people to grasp. Since nothing, emptiness, is something
real in the western mind. As you exhale, relax the brain, just as you
would your leg or arm each time you exhale. think.. "do not think".

        Between each thought, is a microsecond where we don't think about
anything.  When we veg on a campfire, or some relaxing primevil thing,
the space between thoughts grows, and we benefit.  Good meditation lets
us look at our "self" which is inbetween the thoughs, telling us what
we really want to think about, what we truly are inside. 

        So.
        1. Find a comfortable place.
        
        2. Close your eyes.
        
        3. Concentrate on breathing.

        4. Each time you exhale, relax a body part, feel the tension
           in that body part leave your body. You can actually feel
           the bad energy leave.

        5. When the body is relaxed, do the same to your brain. Relax
           the brain each time you exhale.

        6. "do not think", or "think of nothing" whichever works for you.

        7.  Try relaxing the internal organs, especially the adrenal
            glands.

        8.  At first you will see the inside of your eye lids and your
            eyes will try to focus on them. "do not think" and allow
            the space between thought to increase, slowly increase the
            time space between thoughts.


      During meditation, the body functions slow down, yet the brain
does not.  After meditation, you will feel more relaxed and peaceful 
than before.  The human is not designed for prolonged stress, and
meditation allows the mind time to heal itself, and enhances the body's 
ability to heal itself.  This is a basic introduction to fundamental
introductory technique.  Try this and see where it takes you.  Don't
be too surprised if you loose the physical sensation of your physical
body and see, not the insides of your eye lids, but the infinite
rhelm of your own mind.  As outter space, is a void, a vacuum, you will
soon see that the human mind is exactly the opposite.

                     INTERMEDIATE MEDITATION TECHNIQUE

MEDIATION INFORMATION.


INTERMEDITE MEDITATION TECHNIQUE; CRASH COURSE IN INTERMEDIATE MEDITATION

        
        Finding a comfortable place is important in learning meditation
   since distractions at first, make it harder to meditate.  Some people
   picture meditation being performed in the lotus position, with sticks
   of incense making the room smell like a head-shop.  Well the opposite
   is true. Meditation is fun to do in a big comfortable chair in your
   living room, or a simple lawn chair in the back yard.  

        Close your eyes when you begin to meditate, and at first you see
   the inside of your eye lids, then you begin to see beyond that. The most
   fundamental thing I notice when I begin to relax and meditate, is that
   I hear sounds around me that I was previously unaware of.  Just as during
   normal activity I am unaware of my "true self", during meditation I 
   become dramatically more aware of sounds around me. Especially outdoors,
   I hear the sounds of birds and the wind through the trees, and the
   drone of traffic in the distance becomes less and less.

        As I concentrate on breathing, it gives my mind something singular
   to do. The opposite of meditation is the state in which our mind 
   flows continously with random thoughts and pictures.  Concentrating
   on breathing and relaxing our muscles and internal organs and brains
   each time we exhale, also slows down the number of thoughts that
   normally fire randomlly across our frantic minds.  

        Each time you exhale, relaxing a body part, feeling the tension
   in that body part leave your body is actually healthy and allows blood
   to flow more freely, yet more slowly throughout.  Relaxing the mind
   as we exhale also relaxes the small blood vessles, allow blood and
   the oxygen it carries to penetrate the brain blood barrier more
   successfully.  The goal is to "not think" for a change.  Turn off 
   that thought machine.  If a thought bounces out from someplace, ignore
   it and don't bounce it back.
         
        "do not think", or "think of nothing" whichever works for you.
   Sometimes when we meditate, the mind is a jumble of thoughts.  These
   thoughts are the outter most and most frantic and most unimportant
   thoughts.  The mind is perhaps like a large corporation.  On the outter
   most levels are workers. They work and work and work, and dream up
   more work and work, without real insightful thought. As you see further
   and further into the inner most workings of the company, you see folks
   doing less and less, yet they are more important to the success of the
   company.  At the very inner most workings of the company is one man 
   who really does the least amount of work, or so it appears.

        Our mind is something like that.  As your whirling thoughts begin
   to slow, and true relaxations and absence of though follows, we can
   begin to look inward. Thoughts still flow, but in less frantic and
   more important forms.  As we peer deeper and deeper between all the
   frantic thought factories, we are allowing the inner most voices in
   our mind a chance to be seen.  To get in touch with our "true self"
   like the president of the company, we must turn off all thoughts,
   and look deeper and deeper within until we reach our true self.  And
   only by "not thinking" in our very aware state are we able to turn
   off all the noise that prevents from hearing what our true self has 
   to say.  Our true self may not instantenously say anything, but it now
   knows that we want to hear what it has to say. Thus the insight we
   achive through meditation may not happen during meditation, but maybe
   days later, when we least expect it, the pieces of ourselves, have
   shut-up long enough finally for the rest of our "true self" to hear
   what we really want.

        I have heard peering into the mind described as "tip toeing
   through sleeping elephants" so immense are our normal thought processes.
   Have you ever gone camping, and had no radio, no idiots pissing beer
   into the fire.  Have you ever been able to stare at the fire.  It's
   energy draws one out of the deepest corners of our minds.  When we
   sit by on a fire, it feels relaxing, because it helps us to quiet our
   normal frantic thought processes that are necessary for survival
   in a split second dangerous world. Frantic thoughts are hard to turn off
   once they start.

   THE MANTRA:
        Some people use tricks to help in meditation. Just as quietly
   watching a peaceful warm campfire relaxes the mind and helps us to 
   focus our thoughts, and turn off the frantic unneeded noise in our
   minds, so does The Mantra.  Some people are aided in meditation by
   humming some deep, low, primevil sounding chanting sounds, or by
   staring at an imaginary object in their relaxed state.  If this helps
   you than it's great.  If ANYTHING help you meditate than it is good,
   but everybody's mind is different, so although hearing a Mantra 
   sound inside your mind, or actually vocalizing it outloud may be
   worth trying sometime, it may or may not actually help you. 

        Meditation is so simple to do, and is so valuable to us as 
   humans, but yet it's difficult to find sane information on the subject.
   I've looked for good books on the subject, but most just seem to be
   hippies playing their own drum.  Meditation is very valuable and a
   personal thing we mustn't let wierdos scare us away from.  The human
   body is a temple, but hell, I sure like to smoke a cigar once in a while
   and eat a cheese burger at MacDonalds. After all, there is more to 
   life than TV and traffic.  I don't consider living in a old VW bus to
   be anybody's answer to life. It sounds more to me like running away from
   life.  If you want to take a trip, try taking one into your own mind
   through meditation and visiting your true self for a change.  You'll
   probably like what you see :)

                   DEPRESSION 
                ****************

        There are two types of depression.  

        1.  BI-POLAR. (or Manic Depression) 
                     This means one day you feel like killing yourself,
            and the next day you feel like painting the house purple. 
            Bi-polar depression is characterized by INTENSE mood swings,
            from feeling super super super super great, to feeling lower
            than slug shit.  

            Bi-Polar depresssive is also called MANIC-DEPRESSION. Manic
            means you want to go out a run up 8,000 $ on your credit
            card and just might do it too.  Manic means you feel like
            taking clocks apart, putting them back together, and then
            writing a 3,000 page novel about it.  Then the next day you
            might mood "swing" back and feel like killing yourself and 
            feeling afraid to leave your bed for a month or two. Manic
            depression can cause hallucinations and other scary shit
            in some folks.

            Lithium.
                    Lithium is a mineral salt, like... salt.  People
            who are manic depressives, (or bi-polar), can have their
            mood swings slowed and even stopped by the proper daily dose
            of lithium.  Lithium can poison the system if too high a dose
            is given, so people have to be tested while their lithium
            dosage levels are being adjusted.  Too little lithium and the
            effects aren't felt correctly, and too much lithium and they
            get physically ill from the stuff.  TONS of people take lithium
            every day.  Manic depression doesn't affect one constantly,
            it may lay dormant for years and years.  People with manic or
            bi-polar depression should take their lithium even when their
            depression or manic behavior is dormant just as a preventative
            to keep it from coming back.

            SSRI's.  (prozac, paxil, zoloft)
                     SSRI's are Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, are drugs
            that have been almost as revolutionary in the treatment of
            depression and lithium was when it was introduced.  SSRI's are
            pretty new to the scene.  The theory is that feeling good, is
            caused by serotonin, and feeling bad is caused by serotonin
            being cleaned out of the brain to quickly by the brain. These
            drugs keep serotonin from being cleaned out of the brain as 
            quickly as it normally would be during a depressive phase.
                   

*****************************************************************************
        2.  Strait depression.
                
                Another type of depression, perhaps much much more common
            than bi-polar depression, is what I call strait depression. 
            This is where you just feel depressed all the time, or worse
            feel like killing yourself continously.  SSRI's are very helpful
            to many people who feel this way, and others aren't helped by
            them as well, but the beneficial effect of SSRI drugs can be
            so dramatic that their use is certainly worth experimenting with.
            Some people are helped tremendously by one SSRI, and not by 
            another type at all.  The effect takes several days to weeks
            to be fully felt.  If you feel depressed like this, even a little
            you should go see a doctor or councelor immediately before
            it gets worse, and tell them you want to try a SSRI. It's not
            like pain killer and they will be happy to try to help you out.

            Head Chef's theories on depression.

       Our mind is under continous stress from the outside world. Living
       in traffic, sucking down car exhaust, it never ends.  Some depression     
       can be triggered when we are exposed to seemingly unsolable stress
       for a prolonged period, such a job search, not finding a sexual
       partner, living with a drunk, etc.  We may form pictures in our
       mind that motivate us. We see a picture in our minds of living
       like Ozzie and Harriet, or making tons of money at a great rewarding
       job, but as this picture of a possible future is so vivid, yet 
       as each day goes by that it seems that more unobtainable... well
       we reach a point where we either say "fuck this picture" and 
       form new pictures in our mind, or we get profoundly depressed
       mentally and physically as well.

       Intelligence also plays a roll.  People who constantly blame others
       for their problems are probably less likely to become depressed. 
       When something bad happens to us, we either blame.
          
          1. Ourselves or Somebody else.
          2. Something temporary or somthing permanent.

       If we blame something on somebody else, as less intelligent persons
       always do, we are less likely to be depressed because we have no
       responsibility for the situtation if it's completely somebody elses
       fault. But if that person isn't around to be blamed, and we blame
       all or even a small part of the blame on ourselves... well it's
       not fair to ourselves and ads to worries that cause depression.

       Again, if we blame something permanent like ourselves or the
       government or a giant corporation, we see less hope for ourselves, 
       than if we were to blame something temporary. This is flawed because
       even though we may see fault in ourselves as being permanent, we in 
       fact are continously changing. Personal changes happen continously
       but inpercievably because they are in us, and because, well you can't
       watch a flower bloom if it's right in front of your face the whole
       time. Personal change is like a flower blooming. Give it a chance
       and cut yourself some slack.
******************************************************************************

     What to do.

     1. See a doctor and try SSRI's, or other drugs and see if they help.
        Most psychiatric offices have counselors you can talk to who
        can get the head shrink to prescribe you medications. This is
        probably the way to go. 
     
     2. Learn about depression by reading everything you can get your
        hands on about depression and feeling better.  

     3. If your doctor wants you to come in more than you think is necessary
        just call and cancel the appointment and ask for a refill of your
        medication over the phone.  They should be happy to oblidge.

     4. Slow down your mind.  Once the mind starts thinking about solving
        what is perceives as an unsolbable problem... well it's like
        telling a computer to divide something by zero.. it just blows up
        eventually.  Take a hot bath, try camping and having a campfire
        etc.  

     5. Let your friends in on how you're feeling. If they call and ask
        you to do something you feel freaked out about doing because of
        your depression, tell them why and thank them for asking. You
        DONT want to isolate yourself from your friends. Explain to them
        that you feel really really really wierd right now, and that you
        really really appreciate them asking you to do something and that
        you really really would appreciate if they would not hesistate to
        ask you to do something again. Don't dwell on WHY you feel depressed.
        It can be contagious and make folks less likely to enjoy your
        company.  

      6. DEPRESSION IS TEMPORARY no matter what your temporarily sick
         mind tells you.  Hang in there, dig in your heels and kick
         your fucking depression in it's stupid depressing ass!

      7. You have NO idea how many people are affected by depression. It's
         like 50% of the population at one time or another.

      8. Try meditation. This may be a hopeless effort at first, but as
         you begin to get your shit back together this can really help 
         speed-up the healing process.  Our mind is flooded with wierd
         thoughts that mess us up sometimes.  Meditation is relaxed
         concentration, where the person meditating turns off thoughts
         and just peers into the blackness of the mind.  In a relaxed mind,
         there is a pause between thoughts during which time the deep
         parts of our soul do the thinking. But when we're stressed out,
         there is no time between thoughts.  Relax and tell the mind to
         shut up for a while and it lets the quieter parts of the mind
         come forth and help us out.

             to describe some techniques which have been helpful to me
             personally. If you cripple yourself accept responsiblity 
             for it. When in doubt see a chiropractor. They do great stuff.
             Your problem may be more serious and the following exercises
             may cause more problems.

Problem: Computer Neck, also know as Military Neck.

Cause: Sitting in a cheap chair while using a computer.


CHEAP CHAIR
BackGround:        
        A "Cheap Chair" causes strain on the neck when the top of the 
chair-back leans back too far.  If you lean back in the chair and
your face is 1.Pointed at the ceiling, or 2.Too far to see the moinitor,
then you have a cheap chair. A good chair should have lots of right angles
while a cheap chair is for watching TV and slouching in. 
        Go to an office supply house and get a real chair. Don't spend 
over a hundred bucks, but it will be the best investment you can make 
since a sore neck affects all the rest of your life.  Look for one with
a adjustable height lever on the side, a back, and arms. Don't buy a used
one because it was probably put on the market to keep some cheap ass company
from spending more money on workers compensation claims due to bad chair
design.

Helpful exercises:
        
SHOULDERS
Sitting or standing, point your arms strait up into the air then
move them to point behind you and outwards. This will make your shoulders
crack.
        
NECK CRACK
Sitting or standing, relax your neck, slowly letting it fall back
wards, slowly, slowly, CRACK!  Try letting it slowly fall forwards, or
to the sides too SLOWLY. Moving around a sore neck to much will make it 
worse!
        
Sitting or standing, shrug your shoulders backwards and together.
Crunch!

Middle Back Pain and lower back pain:

CAR SEAT
Sitting in a well designed chair that swivels, or on the seat
of your car, rotate your shoulders with your torso from side to side.
Crack.

MONEKEY BARS
Go to the park, hang with your hands from the moneky bars over your head 
taking the weight off your legs so you feet don't touch the ground. Release 
and return CAREFULLY to the ground.  Do this regularily. This is helpfull
for many conditions but works slowly. Be carefull when returning to the 
ground. Bend your knees considerably when landing to absorb shock and 
prevent further damage to your back. This is my favorite but should be
done regularily and be very carefull when letting yourself back down from
hanging.

SWINGERS
While you're at the park, try the swings. They are very good for your
back and kind of fun too. The swings that are made of pieces of rubber
that grip your butt are better than the old wooden ones. Great exercise.

STEPS
Go to some steps. Carpeted is best. Sit near the bottom of the steps.
Lay back against the steps and relax. Experiment.

WALK
Go for a walk. Take long steps with your torso turned to one side or the 
the other. Experiment. If it hurts more one way than the other. Do it the
way that hurts the least. These exercises SHOULD NOT HURT if THE EXERCISE
HURTS, DO NOT DO THAT EXERCISE! Proper chirporactic exercise should feel
relief, not pain!

STAIRS
Find a staircase you can get underneath and hang by your arms taking the
weight off your back and relax. This works like monkey bars. Helps lower
back pain.

BATHTUB
Find a bathtub. If it has a shower door rack on the rim, put a soft towel
over it.  Stand on the bathroom floor with your back to the tub. Bend
your knees and do a deep knee bend with your back barely touching the
side of the bathtub, then slowly lean backwards with your lower back
pressing against the top/side of the tub. Put your hands behind you on the
tub floor if necessary and slowly bend your spin backwards. Maybe turn
your head from side to side. 

BICYCLE
Get a bicycle and go for a short ride regularily, every day up and down
the street is great.  This is a great preventative for the back and an
outstanding cardiovascular exercise.  Exercise should raise the heart beat
SLIGHTLY for a prolonged period of time.  Running isn't aerobic exercise,
while fast walking is.  Avoid exercises that are hard on the joints, like
running.

Deterimine what causes your pain and remedy it if possible.  Don't be 
embarassed to do brief calestenics before lifting a heavy object or doing
heavy work. Ten million Chinese can't be wrong!

Middle Back Pain. Get somebody to pick you up from behind, have your
arms crossed across your chest first like a dead guy. Have them pick you
up from behind then quickly drop you and jerk you back up very slightly.

Lower Back Pain. Try laying on the floor, with a large pillow to support
your head while you watch TV. Take a very small pillow and put underneath
your lower back while you lay there.

Sleeping causing you pain?
Try a different pillow. Too fat of one is bad as it bends the neck during
sleep. Try an old flat one before trying one of those high tech ones.

Don't be afraid to visit a chiropractor. They have done wonders for millions
of people. Beware that many will try to get you to come in 8 times a week
for the rest of your life. Don't be afraid to cancel an appointment. A 
friend of mine had a sore back and her doctor recommended surgery. A friend
suggested another doctor who recommended a chiropractor who recognized that
one of her legs was much longer than the other (this is very common) and
adjusted her back for a couple weeks and had her get special shoes. Her pain
went away and no surgery was required.

Going to a chiropractor will help you realize the ways he or she helps the
problem that you may be able to do yourself.

Some folks go to a (non-sexual) massage place and for less money have
better results than a chiropractor. Don't knock something you haven't
tried. Chiropractors make their money on prolonged visitors, so you
shouldn't be afraid to cancel appointments and go less than they suggest.
Find what works for you.  Find an old established chiropractor. The one's
that advertise on TV are often fly-by-night outfits.  

A regular doctor can give you pills but that won't make the pain go away 
will it really. He can also send you to a surgeon who will recommend
surgery.  Try a chiropractor FIRST before surgery.  Some surgery is a fucking
racket.  The dangers of sugery are very understated by surgeons and 
hospitals.

So start living without pain.  Recognize what you can do, and get help from
a reputable chiropractor if you can't figure it out and correct it 
completely with a new chair or whatever. 

Good luck.
