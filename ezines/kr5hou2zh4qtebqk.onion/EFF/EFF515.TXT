Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet
*********************************

EFF is proud to announce that the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet is now
available for free download from our ftp site.  The Big Dummy's Guide is a
user guide for novices on all the Internet has to offer.

The genesis of the Big Dummy's Guide was a few informal conversations,
which included Mitch Kapor of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and
Steve Cisler of Apple Computers, in June of 1991.  With the support of
Apple Computers, EFF hired a writer (Adam Gaffin) and actually took on the
project in September of 1991.

The idea was to write a guide to the Internet for folks who had little or
no experience with network communications.  The Guide is currently posted
to "the 'net" in ASCII and Hypercard (Mac) formats.  We have been giving it
away on disk at conferences, and we hope to have a print edition available
for a nominal charge soon.  We're hoping to update this Guide on a regular
basis, so please feel free to send us your comments and corrections.

EFF would like to thank the folks at Apple, especially Steve Cisler of the
Apple Library, for their support and gentle prodding in our efforts to
bring this Guide to you.  We hope it helps you open up a whole new world,
where new friends and experiences are sure to be yours.  Enjoy!

The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet can be downloaded by anonymous ftp
from ftp.eff.org.  The ASCII version is located at
/pub/EFF/papers/big-dummys-guide.txt.  The Hypercard stack is located at
/pub/EFF/papers/big-dummys-guide.sit.hqx.

New EFF T-Shirts, Hot Off the Presses
*************************************

EFF has just received a shipment of 1000 new t-shirts.  The design on the
back of the shirt was submitted as part of our t-shirt contest by Steve
Sheinkin, who will receive a free t-shirt and membership into EFF.

The shirts themselves are white with red and black lettering.  On the
front, a small EFF logo is printed on the left.  The back is split into
four blocks and is labelled "Pioneers Throughout History."  The first block
contains a cowboy on a horse looking off into the sunset and is labelled
"The Western Frontier."  The second block contains John F. Kennedy at a
podium and is labelled "The New Frontier."  The third block contains a
starship and is labelled "The Final Frontier."  And the fourth block
contains the EFF logo and is labelled "The Electronic Frontier."

Shirts are available in small and extra-large.  To order the new t-shirts,
send a check for $10 for each shirt to EFF T-Shirts, 1001 G Street, NW,
Suite 950 East, Washington, DC  20001.

Computers, Freedom & Privacy '94
********************************

                    Conference Announcement 
              Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 1994 
                        23-26 March 1994

     The fourth annual conference, "Computers, Freedom, and
Privacy," (CFP'94) will be held in Chicago, Il., March 23-26, 1994. 
The conference is hosted by The John Marshall Law School; George B.
Trubow, professor of law and director of the Center for Informatics
Law at John Marshall, is general chair of the conference. (E-Mail:
<7trubow@jmls.edu>). The program is sponsored jointly by these
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Groups:
Communications (SIGCOMM); Computers and Society (SIGCAS); Security,
Audit and Control (SIGSAC).

     The advance of computer and communications technologies holds
great promise for individuals and society.  From conveniences for
consumers and efficiencies in commerce to improved public health
and safety and increased participation in government and community,
these technologies  are fundamentally transforming our environment
and our lives.

     At the same time, these technologies present challenges to the
idea of a free and open society.  Personal privacy is at risk from
invasions by high-tech surveillance and monitoring; a myriad of
personal information data bases expose private life to constant
scrutiny; new forms of illegal activity may threaten the
traditional barriers between citizen and state and present new
tests of Constitutional protection; geographic boundaries of state
and nation may be recast by information exchange that knows no
boundaries in global data networks.

     CFP'94 will present an assemblage of experts, advocates and
interest groups from diverse perspectives and disciplines to
consider freedom and privacy in today's "information society." A
series of pre-conference tutorials will be offered on March 23,
1994, with the conference program beginning on Thursday, March 24,
and running through Saturday, March 26, 1994.

     The Palmer House, a Hilton hotel located in Chicago's "loop,"
and only about a block from The John Marshall Law School, is the
conference headquarters.  Room reservations should be made directly
with the hotel after September 1, 1993, mentioning John Marshall or
"CFP'94" to get the special conference rate of $99.00, plus tax.

      CALL FOR CFP'94 PARTICIPATION AND PROGRAM SUGGESTIONS

     It is intended that CFP'94 programs will examine the potential
benefits and burdens of new information and communications
technologies and consider ways in which society can enjoy the
benefits while minimizing negative implications. 

     Proposals are requested from those who desire to present an
original paper in a relevant area of technology, policy analysis or
law, or to suggest a program presentation.  Any proposal (1) should
not exceed three typewritten double-spaced pages; (2) must state
the title of the paper or program; (3) briefly describe its theme
and content; and (4) set out the name, address, credentials and
experience of the author or suggested speakers. If a proposed paper
has already been completed a copy should be attached to the
proposal.

                    STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION

Full time college or graduate students are invited to enter the
student paper competition.  Papers must not exceed 2500 words and
should address the impact of computer and telecommunications
technologies on freedom and privacy in society.  Winners will
receive a scholarship to attend the conference and present their
papers. All papers should be submitted by November 1, 1993 (either
as straight text via e-mail or 6 printed copies) to:

                      Prof. Eugene Spafford
