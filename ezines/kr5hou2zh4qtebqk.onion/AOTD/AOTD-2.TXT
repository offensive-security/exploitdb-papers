GATEWAY/WINDO Action Notice:

ALERT! ALERT! ALERT!

The Congress is running out of time to consider S. 2813, the GPO
Gateway to Government, and H.R. 2772, the GPO Wide Information
Network for Data Online (WINDO), legislation this year. These
bills would provide for single point on-line access to government
information through the Government Printing Office (GPO).

The House Committee on Administration and the Senate Committee on
Rules and Administration will likely meet to mark up these bills
before the scheduled August 13 congressional recess.

It is critical that members of these committees, and their
staffs, hear from supporters of the legislation over the next two
weeks if these bills are to pass the Congress this year.

Phone calls to members and their staff are most needed, but
written letters are appropriate as well.  All communication
should emphasize the need for expanded public access to federal
data bases and the simple and efficient good government approach
incorporated in these two bills.

Members of congress can be reached by phone through the Capitol
switchboard at 202/224-3121.  Mail to Senators should be
addressed:  The Honorable ______, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC
20510.  Mail to Congressmen/women should be addressed: The
Honorable _______, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515.

Subject: Article 3--Jerusalem virus part 2 (CVP)
Date: 23 Jul 92 23:50:00 GMT

HISVIR4.CVP   920714
 
                   The "Jerusalem" virus - part 2
 
The history of the Jerusalem virus is every bit as convoluted as its
functionality and family.  The naming alone is a fairly bizarre tale. 
As mentioned before, it was originally called the Israeli virus. 
Although considered unfair by some, it was fairly natural as the
virus had both been discovered and reported from Israel.  (Although
the virus was reported to slow down systems that were infected, it
seems to have been the "continual growth" of EXE files which led to
the detection of the virus.)  In an effort to avoid anti-semitism, it
was referred to by its "infective length" of 1813 bytes.  For COM
files.  For EXE files it was 1808 bytes.  Sometimes.  It varies
because of the requirement that the header of an EXE file is
divisible by 16.  (All quite clear?)
 
One of the early infections was found to be in an office belonging to
the Israeli Defence Forces.  This fact was reported in an Associated
Press article, and, of course, made much of.  It also gave rise to
another alias, the I.D.F. virus.
 
When the virus was first discovered, it was strongly felt that it had
been circulating prior to November of 1987.  The "payload" of file
deletion on Friday the 13th gave rise to conjecture as to why the
logic bomb had not "gone off" on Friday, November 13th, 1987. 
(Subsequent analysis has shown that the virus will activate the
payload only if the year is not 1987.)  The next following "Friday
the 13th" was May 13th, 1988.  Since the last day that Palestine
existed as a nation was May 13th, 1948 it was felt that this might
have been an act of political terrorism.  This led to another alias,
the PLO virus.  (The fact that Israel celebrates its holidays
according to the Jewish calendar, and that the independence
celebrations were slated for three weeks before May 13th in 1988 were
disregarded.  The internal structure of the virus, and the existence
of the sURIV viral programs seems to indicate that any political
correspondence is merely coincidence.)
 
Yet another alias is "sUMsDos", based upon text found in the virus
code itself.  This was, on occasion, corrupted to "sumDOS".
 
The name "Jerusalem" has gained ascendancy, possibly due to the
McAfee SCAN program identification.  (He certainly must be
responsible for the "B" designation for the "original" version.)  Of
course, the great number of variants have not helped any.  Because a
number of the variants are very closely based upon each others code,
the signatures for one variant will often match another, thus
generating even more naming confusion.  This confusion is not unique
to the Jerusalem family, of course, and is an ongoing concern in the
virus research community.

have it no later than the early part of next week. Included
within is the latest on Bellcore's lawsuit threat against us,
as well as a complete guide to the different kinds of
telephone signalling systems used throughout the world
(written by a real heavyweight in the phone phreak world),
a review of the Dutch demon dialer, a tutorial on "portable
hacking", tips on defeating call return (*69), a guide to
voice mail hacking, plus letters, news updates, revelations
of an interesting nature (more Bellcore stuff) plus a whole
lot more.

On Friday, August 7th, we'll be having meetings in six American
cities. We expect all of these meetings to continue on a
monthly basis. Please spread the word. NEW YORK: Citicorp
Center (between Lexington and 3rd) downstairs in the lobby
by the payphones. Payphone numbers: 212-223-9011, 212-223-8927,
212-308-8044, 212-308-8162. WASHINGTON DC: Pentagon City mall.
CHICAGO: Century Mall, 2828 Clark St, lower level, by the
payphones. Payphone numbers: 312-929-2695, 2875, 2685, 2994,
3287. ST. LOUIS: At the Galleria, Highway 40 and Brentwood,
lower level, food court area, by the theaters. LOS ANGELES: At
the Union Station, corner of Macy St. and Alameda. Inside main
entrance by bank of phones. Payphone numbers: 213-972-9358, 9388,
9506, 9519, 9520, 213-625-9923, 9924, 213-614-9849, 9872,
9918, 9926. SAN FRANCISCO: 4 Embarcadero Plaza (inside).
Payphone numbers: 415-398-9803,4,5,6.

There is no agenda at a 2600 meeting, no formalities of any
kind, no dress code (except maybe in St. Louis), and no
constraints other than common sense. People generally get
together, trade information, meet people, look for feds, and
do whatever else comes to mind (all legally, of course).
Each meeting runs approximately from 5 pm to 8 pm local time
on the first Friday of the month. Anyone wanting to organize
a meeting in another city should contact 2600 at our office:
(516) 751-2600.

Our voice mail system is now a voice bulletin board system
every night beginning at 11 pm Eastern time. You can reach
it at 0700-751-2600 through AT&T. If you're using another
long distance carrier, preface that number with 10288.
It costs 15 cents a minute and all of the money goes to AT&T.
Whoopee.

Subject: Article 5--Encrypted Communications
Date: 29 Jul 92 16:20:06 GMT

In general, I think laws making encrypted communications illegal 
are wasteful, stupid and oppressive, for the following reasons:

1)	They would be a violation of free speech rights.
2)	They would be a waste of time and effort, since 
	determining violation can be impossible.

3)	They would be a further waste of time and effort, 
	since such laws are impossible to enforce.

4)	They would allow a government to apply enforcement
	selectively, singling out a few (for arbitrary
	reasons) and prosecuting them under the vague
	suspicion that some communication contained en-
	crypted matter.

Point 1) seems self-evident to me.

Regarding Points 2) - 4):

A few examples and demonstrations come to mind.  One of the
most interesting and illuminating is the old 'Bacon cipher' 
controversy:  the notion that Shakespeare's folios contained 
subtle typeface variations that amounted to an encipherment 
of text written by Francis Bacon, text which indicated that 
Bacon was actually the author of the Shakespeare plays.

As I remember it, there was a heated scholarly controversy 
over this idea for many years, which had all the earmarks of 
crankdom making an assault on basic literary understanding.  
Both sides of the debate attracted large numbers of followers.  
It was all put to rest (at least from a scientific point of 
view) when one researcher who understood cryptography quite 
well managed to demonstrate that by reading the supposed 
typeface variations in different ways and supplying some 
additional overlays or adjustments of data (which the pro-
Bacon people said was necessary to read the hidden text), he 
could make Shakespeare's folio produce any hidden text he 
wanted it to!

Admittedly the cryptographic methods assumed by the pro-Bacon
group were faulty, and modern cryptanalysts would not make
the mistake of inserting a text-decryption overlay that in 
effect would be inserting the encrypted message they wanted 
to find.  Any astute analyst would spot this immediately. 
The trouble is that not everyone involved in trying to make
determinations of violation of anti-encryption law is quali-
fied either to avoid making such an analytical error or to
catch one being made.  And this statement makes no assump-
tion of malice.  What if malice IS the motive?

So perhaps someone might count the characters in each line in
this posting, convert the counts to characters with some 
simple arithmetic function, apply some transformation (either
transposition or substitution, with some arbitrary key) and
decide that I am a dangerous subversive because of the resul-
ting "content" emerging from this process.  There is in fact
no such content.

Another such someone might profess to have found another
message of mine which, when used as a key, produces a plain-
text from selected words in this message.  Between selecting
another message, and selecting the words, they could put
any concealed text in my message that they wanted to find.

Behind all this is the greasy odor of pseudoscience.  Once
a pseudoscientist sets mind on getting a result, all evidence
leads to it.  Or, as one wag put it, "When the theory does not
agree with the facts, the facts must be disposed of."  Mix
the pseudoscientists with the oppressive or manipulative 
politicians, and the results can be explosive.

It is a dangerous farce.  It could be worse law.

Turning to the other end of things, can any REAL concealed
ciphertext be detected?  The answer is, simply, no.  The
reason, strangely enough, is virtually the same as the reason
that the Bacon-cipher people thought they had succeeded.  
All the correspondents need to do is to establish two entirely
independent communications pathways, sending the apparent
plaintext message over one channel, and a key for extracting 
other messages from it over the other.  Unless a cryptanalyst
has access to both channels, no encrypted message sent on one 
channel can be decrypted if the encryption was done with a 
key based on a one-time pad (a once-used series of characters 
or values) sent over the other channel.  The Bacon-cipher
people did this unwittingly when they created the data 
overlays, which amounted to the key.

The channels need not occupy the same medium, nor the same
place or time.  A private conversation can serve as one
channel, and the public network(s) the other.  So if I wanted
to plant an encrypted message in this message, I would only
have to set up a key to produce it, and send the key via let-
ter, radio, telephone, carrier pigeon, whisper, etc. to the
intended recipients of the hidden message.  If I took care
with that communication, no one would have a clue.

And I could make this message contain two entirely contra-
dictory encryptions for two different recipients, just by
sending them different keys.

As an aside, this is how some people who tell fortunes or 
interpret holy scriptures make a living.  I'm not referring 
to honest students of scripture or human nature, only to the 
folks with an axe to grind or money to be made.  Such people 
can be extremely dismissive of scientific argument and 
evidence.


Hoping my recollections of the Bacon cipher controversy are 
basically accurate,

Subject: Article 6--NNTP 1.6 CLIENT KIT RELEASED
Date: 3 Aug 1992 06:30:26 GMT

The NNTP Client tool kit has been released. This kit contains the nntp
client routines that can be used to link into news reader and news posting
software. This client kit has been tested with a number of unix systems
as well as three IBM-PC TCP/IP stacks (Lan WorkPlace for DOS, PC-NFS and
PC/TCP).

There are two files in the kit. You can get them from lib.tmc.edu
via anonymous ftp in /public/nntp1.6/client or from bcm.tmc.edu in
/nntpclnt. They can also be retreived by sending mail to the archive server
address "archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu" with the following body in the message:

send nntpclnt kit1
send nntpclnt kit2

Send bugs and comments to "nntp@tmc.edu"

Subject: Article 7--Linux 0.97 Released

finger torvalds@kruuna.Helsinki.FI
[kruuna.Helsinki.FI]

                   Free UNIX for the 386
The current version of linux is a 0.97, released 92.08.01.  There is a
0.96 rootdisk that should be used with the new versions: it fixes a lot
of things with the old rootdisks and contains more programs due to the
shared libraries.
0.97 supports X11r5 and the new gcc-2.1 (and newer) libraries with
multiple shared libs - as well as any old binaries (except the 0.12
version of gdb which used the older ptrace() interface).  0.96c also
contains support for debugging (core-dumping and attach/detach) as well
as profiling (use gcc-2.2.2 for the profiling code)
Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused.
There are now a lot of other sites keeping linux archives. Some of them
are:
	tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
		directory /pub/linux
	banjo.concert.net (192.101.21.6):
		directory /pub/Linux
	yagi.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp (130.34.222.67)
	
(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)
There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'.
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'.
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).
There is also a newsgroup that contain linux-related questions and
information: comp.os.linux.
Mail me for more info:

0.97 has these major new things relative to 0.96
 - select() through the VFS routines
 - easily installable IRQ's
 - bus-mouse driver
 - msdos filesystem (alpha)
 - extended filesystem (alpha)
 - serial line changes (faster, changeable irq's etc)
 - dynamic buffer-cache
 - new and improved SCSI drivers
