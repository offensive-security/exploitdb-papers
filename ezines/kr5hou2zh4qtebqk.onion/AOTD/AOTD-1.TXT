Welcome to the first issue of Art of Technology Digest!!
AoT Digest is an open forum dedicated to sharing information among
computerists and to the presentation and debate of diverse views.
AoT-D material may be reprinted as long as the source is cited.
Some authors do copyright their material, and they should be contacted
for reprint permission.  It is assumed that non-personal mail at the
moderators may be reprinted unless otherwise specified.  Readers are
encouraged to submit reasoned articles relating to computer culture
and communication.  Articles are preferred to short responses.
The idea (and the format and one of the articles) of AoT Digest
is from Cu-Digest. Anyways this newsletter is for discussion of
the computer underground. It is NOT a hack/phreak newsletter, just
a rip-off of CuD with different information. Make a new file base and you're
set. I want to make this a weekly newsletter but since it's very small now,
expect something each few weeks or so.  Many of the things you should expect
to find are CPSR press releases and various other Usenet articles and responses 
from our readers.  Hmm.. I am also hoping to make a newsgroup for AoT Digest
but I can't find the FAQ response. "Frequently Asked Question: Where do I get
the response from the 'how to start a newsgroup' FAQ???".  You may also be
wondering what I moderate.  Well, I assemble the whole thing, take out any
high-ASCII and replace it with normal ASCII and put in references.  Words
in the articles are not changed.  We REALLY want responses, either posted
on Live Wire (See DISTRIBUTION in the beginning for the phone number) or
E-Mailed to me (ccappuc@caticsuf.cati.CSUFresno.EDU).  If you have anything
to say, PLEASE respond!

                          ARE YOU A HACKER?
                          by Robert Bickford

Are you a Hacker?  How would you know?  If all you know about the word
is what you've seen on the evening news, or read in a magazine, you're
probably feeling indignant at the very question!  But do those
magazine-selling headlines really describe what a Hacker is?

Some time ago (MicroTimes, December 1986) I defined a Hacker as "Any
person who derives joy from discovering ways to circumvent
limitations." The definition has been widely quoted since that time,
but unfortunately has yet to make the evening news in the way that a
teenager who robs a bank with his telephone does.

Does that teenaged criminal fit my definition?  Possibly.  Does that
fact make all, or even most, Hackers criminals?  (Does that fact make
all or most Hackers teenagers?)  Of course not!  So why is there such
widespread misinformation about Hackers?  Very simply, it's because
the criminal hackers, or 'Crackers', have been making news, while the
rest of us are virtually invisible.  For every irresponsible fool
writing a virus program, there are at least twenty software engineers
earning a living "...discovering ways to circumvent limitations."
When the much-publicized InterNet worm was released by an
irresponsible hacker, hundreds of other Hackers applied their
considerable talents to the control and eradication of the problem:
the brilliance and creativity brought to this task are typical of the
kind of people --- Hackers ---that my definition is meant to describe.

Working on the yearly Hackers Conferences has been a mixed experience:
on the one hand, helping to bring together 200 of the most brilliant
people alive today, and then interacting with them for an entire
weekend, is immensely rewarding.  On the other hand, trying to explain
to others that the Hackers Conference is not a Gathering of Nefarious
Criminals out to Wreak Havoc upon Western Civilization does get a bit
wearing at times.  Also, trying to convince a caller that repeatedly
crashing his school district's computer from a pay phone will not,
emphatically not, qualify him for an invitation to the conference can
be a bit annoying.  None of this would be a problem if we hadn't let a
small minority --- the Crackers --- steal the show, and become
associated with the word 'Hacker' in the minds of the general public.
The attendees at the Hackers Conferences --- many of whom hold PhDs,
and/or are Presidents or other upper management of Fortune 500
companies --- are (quite understandably) very indignant at being
confused with these Crackers.

Taking myself as an example --- no, I don't have a PhD, my only degree
is from the School of Hard Knocks, and no, I'm not working in
management ---when this article was first published [1989] I was
writing software for a company that builds medical image processing
equipment.  My code controls a product that can, and often does,
either improve the quality of medical care, reduce the cost, or both.
When I develop a piece of software that goes around some limit I feel
very happy, and can often find myself with a silly grin plastered
across my face.  When some ignorant reporter writes a story that
equates the work I do with expensive but childish pranks committed by
someone calling himself a "Hacker", I see red.

Are you a Hacker?  If you want to break rules just for the sake of
breaking rules, or if you just want to hurt or "take revenge" upon
somebody or some company, then forget it.  But if you delight in your
work, almost to the point of being a workaholic, you just might be.
If finding the solution to a problem can be not just satisfying but
almost an ecstatic experience, you probably are.  If you sometimes
take on problems just for the sake of finding the solution (and that
ecstatic experience that comes with it), then you almost certainly
are.  Congratulations!  You're in good company, with virtually every
inventor whose name appears in your high school history book, and with
the many thousands of brilliant people who have created the "computer
revolution."

What can we do about all that bad press?  Meet it head on!  Tell the
people you work with that you're a Hacker, and what that means.  If
you know somebody whose work habits, style, or personality make them
pretty clearly a Hacker, tell them so and tell them what you mean by
that.  Show them this article!

Meanwhile, have fun finding those solutions, circumventing those
limitations, and making this a better world thereby.  You are an
Artist of Technology, a Rider of the Third Wave, and at least you can
enjoy the ride!

Subject: Article 3--New! 386BSD Release 0.1!

[[ED: This is edited notes from the installation docs and distribution list
      Remember that 386BSD is a FREE operating system, if you have a 386/486
      and 50 megs to spare, I strongly recommend that you get this. At the
      end is the list of anonymous FTP sites to get 386BSD. Have fun!!]]

     Welcome to 386BSD Release 0.1, the	second	edition  of
the  386BSD  operating	system	created by William and Lynne
Jolitz. Like its predecessor, 386BSD  Release  0.0,  Release
0.1  comprises	an  entire  and complete UNIX-like operating
system for the 80386/80486-based AT Personal Computer.

     386BSD Release 0.1 is an enhanced version of the origi-
nal  release  done  by	William	F. Jolitz, the developer of
386BSD. 386BSD Release	0.0  was  based	on  the  Networking
Software,  Release  2  from  the University of California at
Berkeley EECS Department, and included much  of	the  386BSD
work  done  earlier  by	Bill  and  contributed by us to the
University.  The latest release, 386BSD	Release  0.1,	con-
tains  new  work  by  the developer and many new items which
have been freely contributed by	other	software  developers
for  incorporation  into 386BSD (see the file CONTRIB.LIST).
These contributions have  increased  the  functionality	and
made  it more robust.

     386BSD is intended for  research,	development,  educa-
tion,  and just plain exploration. Source, Binary, Installa-
tion, and Fix-It floppies are available at a large number of
sites.	There are many user groups, support groups, computer
societies and individuals  who	are  supplying	and  running
386BSD and they are good sources of information and support.

     386BSD Release 0.1 is intended to	be  widely  used  by
those  interested in "pushing the envelope" towards the for-
mation and development of innovative ideas in computer tech-
nology.	As such, we have spent considerable time developing
a system which	is  simple  to	partition  and	install	and
emphasizes stability and completeness.


     Among the many new features of 386BSD (from release 0.0):


*    New "Tiny 386BSD" System Installation Floppy

*    Simplified installation procedures.

*    386BSD partitioning for use on an MS-DOS system.

*    Compressed,    multivolume	CPIO     dump     format
     binary/source/other  distribution	sets on MS-DOS flop-
     pies.

*    387 emulation.

*    SCSI support.

*    CD-ROM support.

*    NFS, TCP/IP and full networking.

*    New 386BSD "Fix-It" System Maintenance Floppy.

*    New "Additional User Software" MS-DOS floppy dump.

                        Free UNIX for the 386
The current version of linux is a 0.96c, released 92.07.04.  There is a
0.96 rootdisk that should be used with the new versions: it fixes a lot
of things with the old rootdisks and contains more programs due to the
shared libraries.  Patch 2 to 0.96c was released 92.07.18, and
implemented the msdos filesystem as well as correcting some problems
with the IRQ code.
0.96c supports X11r5 and the new gcc-2.1 (and newer) libraries with
multiple shared libs - as well as any old binaries (except the 0.12
version of gdb which used the older ptrace() interface).  0.96c also
contains support for debugging (core-dumping and attach/detach) as well
as profiling (use gcc-2.2.2 for the profiling code)
Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' (128.214.6.100)
in the directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  This directory structure contains all
the linux OS- and library-sources, and enough binaries to get going.  To
install linux you still need to know something about unices: it's
relatively straightforward to install, but the documentation sucks raw
eggs, and people with no previous unix experience are going to get very
confused.
There are now a lot of other sites keeping linux archives. Some of them
are:
	tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
		directory /pub/linux
	banjo.concert.net (192.101.21.6):
		directory /pub/Linux
	yagi.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp (130.34.222.67)
	
(and many additional sites: there are now sites in the uk, japan etc
that carry linux, but I have lost count)
There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'.
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'.
It's no use mailing me: I have no actual contact with the mailing-list
(other than being on it, naturally).
There is also a newsgroup that contain linux-related questions and
information: comp.os.linux.
Mail me for more info:
		Linus Torvalds (torvalds@kruuna.Helsinki.FI)
		Pietarinkatu 2 A 2

		Finland
0.96c.pl2 has these new features (relative to unpatched 0.96c)
 - select() through the VFS routines
 - faster and more general sleep/wakeup routines
 - easily installable IRQ's
 - bus-mouse driver
 - msdos filesystem
0.96c has these new features (relative to 0.96b)
 - alpha-testing code of the extended filesystem
 - serial line changes (changeable irq's etc)
 - pty/console fixes.

Subject: Article 6--Sysop Arrested For Selling Porno Files To Juveniles
 
             **SYSOP ARRESTED FOR PORNO FILES TO JUVENILES**
                 Mark Lehrer, sysop of AKRON ANOMALY BBS
 
 
         MUNROE FALLS OH, July 21, 1992.  Munroe Falls Police Chief
    Steve Stahl knows computers are big with kids these days, but he
    never thought he'd see the day when a healthy 15-year-old boy would
    choose a floppy disk over a Playboy centerfold.
 
         But now that Stahl's seen some of the floppy disks popular
    with local youths, he understands the fascination.
 
         "Give me any kid, I know what he's going to download," Stahl
    said.

         In May, Munroe Falls Police received a complaint from a
    resident who feared that a local computerized community BBS
    containing sexually explicit material might be accessible to
    children.
 
         Stahl said the resident showed him files called "Alison" and
    "amber," both of which featured naked women.  He told the concerned
    resident, "Oh, well, I can see how that would be upsetting."
 
         For the past two months, police conducted an investigation and
    sting using a local 15-year-old boy.  After the youth was able to
    hook into the BBS, police arrested Mark Lehrer, 22, owner and
    operator of AKRON ANOMALY, a 1000 member BBS.  POLICE ALSO SEIZED
    ALL OF LEHRER'S COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.
 
         Lehrer is accused of distributing graphic sexual material via
    a computer modem from the Munroe Falls home of his parents, David and
    Susan Lehrer.  His father, also a computer professional, is chairman of
    the Village's Charter Review Commission.  Mark has been charged in
    Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court with one count each of disseminating
    matter harmful to juveniles and possession of criminal tools - in this
    case, his computer and graphic files.
 
         A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 21, 1992.  The
    case will probably be turned over to a Summit County Grand Jury,
    which means potential indictment for a felony and, if convicted,
    over a year in state prison.
 
         Chief Stahl said this will be the first case in northeast Ohio
    and one of the first in the state, in which an adult is accused of
    distributing graphic sexual materials *to juveniles* via a
    computer.
 
         "There's not a whole lot of case law on this kind of this," he
    said, adding that most material comes from books, magazines or
    movies.
 
         According to Stahl, members of AKRON ANOMALY paid $15 to $30
    a year to call the board, giving access to games like chess,
    basketball, euchre, programming instructions and *.GIF files -
    (G)raphic (I)nterface (F)iles, that feature pictures from James
    Bond to Capt. Kirk to Scooby-Doo.
 
         Some are labeled specifically for adults and are not supposed
    to be accessible to those under 18, while many others are contained
    in a general directory.  However, when police seized Lehrer's
    records, they found that even the "clean" files contained images
    "not entirely wholesome."
 
         "One was Bugs Bunny eating a carrot, one was Bart Simpson
    riding a skateboard, and one was called (a slang term for oral sex)
    and that was in the 'clean' file," Stahl said.
 
         Stahl said many files not listed in the "adult" category
    contained pictures of naked women and of naked women engaging in
    sexual acts.  One file allegedly shows a nude image of Christina
    Applegate, who plays "Kelly" on the TV show "Married with Chil-
    dren."
 
         "Parents are happy their kids are upstairs using their
    computers.  The one parent we talked to was thrilled they weren't
    finding PLAYBOY magazine.  Well, I've got news for you, this is a
    rude awakening," Stahl said.
 
         In addition to the "graphic still images," juveniles were able
    to access adult movies, which are shown on computer monitors.
    "It's like watching cable TV.  It's a very clear picture," Stahl
    said.
 
         Stahl said computer experts with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal
    Identification and Investigation are reviewing the hundreds of
    computer files seized from Lehrer's home.  Stahl said it's possible
    that some of the games and movies are being accessed in violation
    of copyright laws.
 
         "I'm not saying it's obscene because I'm not getting into that
    battle, but it's certainly not appropriate for kids, especially
    without parental permission," Stahl said.

Subject: Article 7--CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles

PRESS RELEASE

July 24, 1992

CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles


WASHINGTON, DC -- Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
(CPSR), a national public interest organization, has recommended
privacy guidelines for the nation's computer network.

At a hearing this week before the National Commission on Library and
Information Science, CPSR recommended a privacy policy for the National
Research and Education Network or "NREN." Marc Rotenberg, Washington
Director of CPSR, said "We hope this proposal will get the ball rolling.
The failure to develop a good policy for the computer network could be
very costly in the long term."

The National Commission is currently reviewing comments for a report to
the Office of Science and Technology Policy on the future of the NREN.

Mr. Rotenberg said there are several reasons that the Commission should
address the privacy issue.  "First, the move toward commercialization of
the network is certain to exacerbate privacy concerns.  Second, current
law does not do a very good job of protecting computer messages.  Third,
technology won't solve all the problems."

The CPSR principles are (1) protect confidentiality, (2) identify
privacy implications in new services, (3) limit collection of personal
data, (4) restrict transfer of personal information,(5) do not charge
for routine privacy protection, (6) incorporate technical safeguards,
(7) develop appropriate security policies, and (8) create an
enforcement mechanism.

Professor David Flaherty, an expert in telecommunications privacy law,
said "The CPSR principles fit squarely in the middle of similar efforts
in other countries to promote network services.  This looks like a good
approach."

Evan Hendricks, the chair of the United States Privacy Council and
editor of Privacy Times, said that the United States is "behind the
curve" on privacy and needs to catch up with other countries who are
already developing privacy guidelines.  "The Europeans are racing
forward, and we've been left with dust on our face."

The CPSR privacy guidelines are similar to a set of principles developed
almost 20 years ago called The Code of Fair Information practices.
The Code was developed by a government task force that included policy
makers, privacy experts, and computer scientists.  The Code later became
the basis of the United States Privacy Act.

Dr. Ronni Rosenberg, who has studied the role of computer scientists in
public policy, said that "Computer professionals have an important role
to play in privacy policy. The CPSR privacy guidelines are another
example of how scientists can contribute to public policy."

Subject: Article 8--DNA databanking

Today (7/28) the Wall Street Journal features an article (page B1) on
DNA databanking, the FBI's computer database of DNA data, and the
concerns of critics.  The article reports that fifteen states now have
DNA databanking programs, and it is estimated that double that number
will have such programs in place by 1995.  There have been 600 trials
using DNA as evidence since 1988.  Next year the FBI is scheduled to
link state programs in a nation-wide computer network.

The article describes the first "cold search" of DNA databanks, in a
Minnesota case in which a defendant was arrested for the rape and murder
of a Minneapolis woman on the basis of a DNA match appearing in the
state's computerized system.  The crime-scene DNA was acquired from a
sperm sample and it matched a sample collected from a convicted sex
offender when he was a prisoner.

Last week the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the highest court in
the state, ruled that DNA matching may not be used as conclusive
prosecutorial evidence in a criminal trial, although the lack of a match
can be used as a defense.  Massachusetts is the only state in the
country that has produced such a court ruling -- all of the other 40
appellate court rulings have been in favor of using DNA evidence in
support of the prosecution's case.  The Massachusetts court said that
there is insufficient scientific consensus on the validity of DNA
matching.  The court cited a recent report by the National Research
Council, which said that the state of the art leaves the technology open
to doubt.  But this could change in the future, and the Massachusetts
ruling does not rule out DNA evidence if the technology generates a
tighter scientific consensus.

Nachama Wilker, executive director of the Council for Responsible
Genetics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that the collection of DNA
samples from all prisoners is a slippery slope that will affect the use
of DNA in non-criminal social transactions, such as eligibility for
insurance, employment opportunity, and other forms of discrimination.
She says in The Wall Street Journal that there are no guarantees that
DNA data collected from prisoners will be used exclusively for criminal
justice procedures, and she argues that DNA evidence should only be used
for serious crimes with demonstrated patterns of repeated offenses.
Some states have passed legislation protecting the confidentiality of
DNA data, such as Wisconsin, which prohibits DNA data from being used
for insurance eligibility or employment evaluation.  Only five states
have such laws on the books, however.  Some public interest advocates
are supporting a DNA Identification Bill in the Congress, already passed
by the House, that would enforce confidentiality, limit the use of DNA
data, and impose federal standards on state laboratories.  The NRC
report also called for laboratory accreditation by federal agencies.
