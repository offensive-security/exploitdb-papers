			Cellular Secrets by BOOTLEG
			        (C) 1992

	Let me start out by saying this file won't be in the best of
	ordered content as I'll be skipping around a little quoting
	data from various manuals as it pops into my mind. It will
	however, allow anyone that reads it thoroughly and obtains
	the manuals & equipment specified within, to do virtually
	anything regarding Cellular!

	ESN= Electronic Serial Number (every cellular has one in Rom)
	MIN= The cellulars phone #      "     "       "   "    "  "
	Reverse Channel= The channel the Cellular phone broadcasts on.
	Foward Channel = The channel the Cell Site broadcasts on.

	Remember these key terms as they are the secret to cellulars.

	Most cellulars have the ESN/MIN located in a Eprom/EEprom
	located somewhere on the circuit board.(older cellulars may
	not have a ESN) These are usually 27c256 or 27c512 eproms
	which can be burned or changed by standard eprom burners.
	They also contain the cellulars programming which can be
	changed.
	 When you power up a cellular, it sends its ESN/MIN to the
	cell site on the reverse channel. The cell site then returns
	the MIN with an OK signal if their database verifies the ESN/MIN.
	Some newer cell site software will verify the ESN/MIN with the
	C.O. before allowing the call. If everything is ok, the cellular
	will then be able to place a call.

	(The REVERSE channels ESN/MIN & related data can be captured by
	equipment listed at the end of this file.)
	 It seems like some scoundrels have captured other peoples
	ESN/MIN and burned new Eproms enabling another cellular phone
	to act as the original. Rumor has it that hackers have gone as
	far as actually changing the eproms software whereby the program
	jumps past the ESN/MIN address in the eprom to an address location
	that can be programmed into memory via the handset! Yet another
	rumor has it that some even go as far as re-programming the
	software to capture other cellulars ESN/MIN and automatically
	store the data in memory. This naturally allows someone to place
	fraudulent calls while frequently changing ESN/MINs to avoid all
	forms of detection. The cell sites usually use frequencies on
	the Non-wireline A band as forward channels. The reverse channels
	are usually 45 mhz below the forward channels. These
	REVERSE channels are the ones scanned by "UNSAVORY DOGS" that steal
	others ESN/MINs for fraudulent use. (hehe) Note that one hacker
	seems to think one can use a Z80 Uncompiler/Compiler on the eproms
	software of some cellulars. (The Shame of it all!) Other cellulars
	use different but common microprocessors of which compilers/de
	compilers are easily available.

	  Ok-now that you have the theory behind cellular phreaking, I'll
	continue on to some backround & tech stuff you'll need.

			      Cellular Overview

	A cell system divides the service area into small, low power
	areas called cells. A cell system has a continuous patern of these
	cells, each having a 1 to 40 mile radius (usually 5-10 miles).
	Within each cell is a base station which contain several
	transcievers and control equipment for the channels assigned
	to that cell. These are all connected to a MTSO which is in
	turn connected to a CO (central Office) switch. Each cell operates
	on an assigned channel and may have numerous paging and voice
	channels assigned to it.
	 The cellular radio freqs have been divided by the FCC into 2
	equal bands to allow 2 different systems to co-exist and compete
	in the same area. Originally there were 666 channels,but that
        was expanded to 832 in 1988, and with NAMPS to 2412 in 1991.

	Band A- Non Wireline               Band B- Wireline

	Control channels=21 = 313-333        21= 334-354
	Voice channels=001-312                   355-666
	(395 AMPS/1185 NAMPS)                (395 AMPS/1185 NAMPS)

	Control channels are used to send and receive only digital
	data between the cellular phone & the cell base station.
	The 21 control channels in each band may be dedicated to two
	different applications: access and paging channels.
	 The data on the Foward control channels provides such info as
	the system identification number and range of channels to scan
	to find the access and paging channels. Access channels are used
	to respond to a page or to originate a call. The system and the
	cell phone will use access channels where 2-way data transfer
	occurs to determine the initial voice channel. Paging channels
	if used are the holding place for an idle cell phone. When the
	call is received at the central controller for a cellular phone,
	the paging signalling will start on a paging channel. In many
	systems, both control channel functions will be served by the
	same access channel for a particular cell. Multiplepaging
	channels are only used in high density areas.

	NAM = Number assignment Module: This is a memory component (usually
	      an Eprom/EEprom) that contains a cell phones ESN/MIN/SCM,
	      lock code,etc. Some phones can be re-programmed via the
	      handset so one can change their MIN several times. (usually
	      the phones software locks it up after 3 to 20 MIN changes)
	      This feature was used limitedly to deceive cell sites when
	      roaming. Newer cell site software is quickly making this
	      trick obsolete. ( the problem being is that one cannot
	      change the ESN via NAM handset programming unless one
	      re-writes the Eprom Software. HeHe)

	MTSO= Mobile Telephone Switching Office

	One must know, there is no distributed intelligence in the first
	generation of cellular systems! AT these cellular base stations
	there is little or no monitering equipment of any kind.

	There are a mix of 3 watt, 1.2 watt and 600 milliwatt cellular
	phones in use today. (keep this in mind as the power of a
	cellular phone is stored in ROM & transmitted along with the
	ESN/MIN and the coding must be correct.)
	3 watt = mobiles, 1.6 watt=transportables, 600 milliwatt=portables

	IS-41 = The newest standard that will let cell switches from
	different vendors hand-off and deliver calls and transfer
	subscriber data profiles. (newest version is REVISION B)
	This document contains tons of usefull info & can be found
	at public libraries, etc. IS-41 rev b, is published by AT&T,
	although the original rev 0 published in 1987 or rev A published
	in 1990 may come in handy when dealing with older/smaller MTSOs
	that haven't upgraded yet.

	MTSOs typically use fiber optic links to cell sites or a 18 ghz
	microwave link. A cell site in turn then probably uses a 38 ghz
	microwave link to a Microcell Transmitter. TDMA and CDMA are
	both vying to become the industry standard.

	SS7 = As soon as a user turns on a cell phone the MIN/ESN for
	that phone will be carried as an SS7 network message to a database,
	known as the home location register(HLR),within the user's home
	carrier system. The HLR will provide information for validation
	as well as customer profile info for advanced features as voice
	mail. That info will then be be relayed to a second database, the
	visitor location register, maintained by the carrier that is
	hosting the roaming call. They hope to reduce fraud by checking
	the ESN with real time validation on a per call basis. The current
	system is unable to detect fraud until after a caller has made
	his first call. (This system simply uses a customers calling
	profile to detect an unusual calling pattern.) Those changing
	ESN/MINs often cannot be detected!

	Cell relay uses fixed length packets- 48 bytes for the payload
	and 5 bytes for the header. Two existing cell relay standards
	are IEEE 802.6 (DQDB) and ATM. They differ only in content of
	the header.

	Each cellular has 2 channels associated with it, the transmit
	(REVERSE) and the receive (FOWARD).
	REVERSE freqs= 824-848 mhz
	Forward freqs= 869-894 mhz
	Conventional dispatch=806-809.7 mhz and 851-854.75 mhz
	Trunked dispatch= 809.75-824 mhz and 854.75-869 mhz
	General reserve=848-851 mhz and 894-902 mhz and 928-947 mhz
	channel spacing = 30 mhz AMPS or 10 mhz NAMPS

	*************************************************************

		       Reverse Channel Info

	Voice channels are used primarily for conversation, with signaling
	used with quick data bursts or tones to handle cell to cell handoffs,
	output power control of the cellular radio-phone and special control
	features.Foward data from the cell site and REVERSE data from the
	cell phone is sent using frequency shift keying. The data is formatted
	into groups of words with a distinct binary preamble that allows
	the receiver to syncronize to the incomming data. With AMPS, various
	tones are used. With NAMPS the data and tones have been replaced
	by sub-audible digital equivalents that ride under the audio.
	(see EIA - 553 for AMPS or Motorolas NAMPS Air interface
	specification for NAMPS)

		       Signaling Tone(ST) and Digital ST(DST)

	In AMPS, the signalling tone is a 10 khz signal used by the mobile
	on the REVERSE channel (REVC) to signal activities or to acknowledge
	commands from the cell site, including handoffs,alert orders, call
	terminations and switch-hook operation. Various burst lengths are
	used on different ST activities.  On NAMPS channels ST is replaced
	by a digital equivalent called Digital ST (DST) which is the
	compliment of the assigned DSAT. The 10 khz signal is sent for
	50 milliseconds.

		   SAT (Supervisory Audio Tone) and DSAT (Digital SAT)

	The supervisory audio tone (SAT) is one of 3 frequencies:
	    SAT 0 = 5970 hz
	    SAT 1 = 6000 hz                 ( plus or minus 2khz on these
	    SAT 2 = 6030 hz                  3 freqs.)
	These are used in AMPS signaling. On NAMPS channels SAT is replaced
	by one of 7 subaudible digital equivalents or vectors called DSAT.
	SAT or DSAT is generated by the cell site, checked for frequency
	or accuracy by the cell phone, then transponded back to the cell
	site on the REVERSE voice channel (REVC). The cellular telephone
	uses (D)SAT to verify that it is tuned to the correct channel
	after a new voice channel assignment. When the CO signals the
	mobile regarding the new voice channel, it also tells the mobile
	of the SAT freq of the DSAT vector to expect on the new channel.
	The returned (D)SAT is used at the cell site to verify the presence
	of the telephones signal on the designated frequency.

	   DSAT = +/- 700 hz deviation

	   Data = Transmitted at 10 kbits/sec. Used for sending System
	   Orders & mobile identification. In cellular the data is
	   transmitted as Frequency Key Shifting, where the carrier is
	   shifted high 8 khz in AMPS(700 hz in NAMPS) to represent
	   a logic high (or 1), and the carrier is shifted low 8 khz in
	   AMPS(700 hz in NAMPS) to represent a logic low (or 0). Control
	   channels carry data only. Voice channels carry data and other
	   signals listed here.

	   Audio = includes all microphone audio & DTMF while in a call
	   (maximum =/- 12 khz deviation AMPS,=/- 5 khz dev NAMPS).
	   DTMF uses 2 tones (one high one low)from a selection of seven
	   tones (4 low,3 high tones) to indicate digits being dialed.
	   In AMPS signalling, audio & ST are accompanied by SAT.

	*******************************************************************

			Placing a call from a Cellular Phone

	When first turned on, the cellular scans through the FOCCs and
	measure the strengt of each signal. It will then tune to the
	strongest & attempt to decode the overhead control message.
	From the overhead the phone can determine if it is in its
	home system and range of channels to scan for paging and access.
	If paging channels are used, the phone next scans each paging
	channelin the specified range & tunes to the strongest one.
	 Its on that channel the phone will continuously receive
	overhead message info plus paging messages. At this point the
	phone idles, continuously updating the overhead message info in
	its memory and monitoring the paging messages for its telephone
	number.
	 When the cellular phone user originates the call, the phone
	rescans the access channels to assure that its tuned to the
	strongest one. It then transmits at 10kbits per sec on the
	control channel to notify the switch of its MIN (mobile
	identification number (phone number)), its ESN and the number it
	wants to reach. The switch verifies the incomming data and
	assigns a voice channel and a SAT (or DSAT forNAMPS) to the
	telephone. The phone tunes to the assigned voice channel and
	verifies the presence of the proper foward SAT frequency or (DSAT
	message. If SAT (DSAT) is correct the phone transponds SAT(DSAT)
	back to the cell site and unmutes the forward audio. The cell site
	detects reverse SAT(DSAT) from the cellular & unmutes reverse
	audio. At this point the user can hear the other end ring.
	SAT(DSAT is sent and received more or less continuously by both
	the base station & the phone but SAT(DSAT) is not sent during
	data transmissions and the phone does not transpond SAT
	continously during VOX operation. DSAT is suspended during the
	transmission of DST. SAT 7 signalling tones are only used on
	AMPS voice channels & the signalling tone is only transmitted
	by the cellular phone.

	Note that the number called, the ESN, MIN etc. are transmitted
	4 or 5 times & it only takes 260 milliseconds for all this
	data exchange.

	Call termination = 10 khz tone burst for 1.8 seconds.

	If the SCM is not set properly during programming the EProm, it
	might have adverse effects on the operation of the phone. It may
	also flag security software to a "Tumbled Phone". Smart cell
	phreaks will only use ESN/MINs that have the same SCM as their
	own phone they plan on TUMBLING.

                      Cellular phone channel construction

===============================================================================

    Here is a method of determining which frequencies are used in a cellular
system, and which ones are in what cells.  If the system uses OMNICELLS, as
most do, you can readily find all the channels in a cell if you know just one
of them, using tables constructed with the instructions below.

    Cellular frequencies are assigned by channel number, and for all channel
numbers, in both wireline and non-wireline systems, the formula is:

   Transmit Frequency = (channel number x .030 MHz) + 870 MHz
    Receive Frequency = (channel number x .030 Mhz) + 825 Mhz

    "Band A" (one of the two blocks) uses channels 1 - 333.  To construct a
table showing frequency by cells, use channel 333 as the top left corner of a
table.  The next entry to the right of channel 333 is 332, the next is 331,
etc., down to channel 313.  Enter channel 312 underneath 333, 311 under 332,
etc.  Each channel across the top row is the first channel in each CELL of the
system; each channel DOWN from the column from the the first channel is the
next frequency assigned to that cell.  You may have noted that each channel
down is 21 channels lower in number.  Usually the data channel used is the
highest numbered channel in a cell.

    "Band B" uses channels from 334 to 666.  Construct your table in a similar
way, with channel 334 in the upper left corner, 335 the next entry to the
right.  The data channel should be the lowest numbered channel in each cell
this time.

    This represents how a cellular system might be laid out.  Cells A and B
never share a common border.  Neither do B and C, A and G, etc.  Cells that
are next to each other are never assigned adjacent frequencies.  They always
differ by at least 60 kiloHertz.  To track a mobile phone as it changes cells,
let's put the mobile in a B cell.  When the mobile switches frequencies, you
know that he could only go to an D, E, F or G cell because A and C have
adjacent frequencies. The two tables below will help you determine which
channel cells can go next to each other.  You can contact your local cellular
phone company and see if they have any maps of the cells available.  This is
not a sure thing, but it couldn't hurt to try.

Cells that can go next to each other:

Cell      Compatible cells
 A         C, D, E, F
 B         D, E, F, G
 C         E, F, G, A
 D         F, G, A, B
 E         G, A, B, C
 F         A, B, C, D
 G         B, C, D, E

    Here is a frequency/cell layout chart.  The cell frequencies are used by
the cell site towers, and the mobile frequencies are the input frequencies
used by the cars.

    Monitoring of the base sites is obviously going to be easier than
monitoring the mobiles.  The cell base sites are towers (usually blue) with a
triangle shaped "head" on top, and sporting a couple of what appear to be
vertical antennas.  These base sites have a range of 3-5 miles.  If you take a
look at the honeycomb diagram, you can see how they are laid out.  The cell
transmitter is in the middle of the cell.  It is possible to hear many, most,
or all of the cells in your city, depending on your location.  The closer you
live to a boundary, the greater the chances of your being able to receive more
cells.  Due to the nature of radio signals, the actual cell shape is more or
less round.  However, the hexagon shape lends itself better to show how the
system is laid out.  With a circular coverage area, there will be some
overlapping between adjacent cells.

                                 __    __
                             \__/C \__/D \__
                          \__/G \__/A \__/
                         _/D \__/E \__/F \__
                          \__/B \__*C \__/
                         _/F \__/G \__/A \__
                          \__/D \__/E \__/
                         _/A \__/B \__/C \__
                          \__/  \__/  \__/

    If, for example, you live near the asterisk (*) in the above diagram, you
will be able go easily hear the G, C, E, and A cells you're near.  Since the
maximum _practical_ range of a cell is 3-5 miles, you'll be able to hear them
a bit farther away.  However, due to the nature of the FM transceivers at the
cell sites (they capture only the _strongest_ signal), you should be able to
hear all seven cells.  Which _one_ of each cell you hear will depend on your
location and the strength of the received signal.  In the above diagram,
you'll most likely hear the F cell in the upper right, rather than the one on
the left.

    Mobile reception is almost a waste of time unless you have an outdoor
antenna.  And, since the mobile will be repeated on the cell site, it's better
to listen to the cell frequencies.  You may not be able to hear both sides of
the conversation if you listen only to the mobile frequencies!!! It is useful,
however, for determining which channel cell you're in.  If you use the antenna
that came with the scanner, mobile range will be decreased down to 1 or 2
miles.  By checking the scanner readout against the cell list above
(825.030-844.980 MHz), you can tell what cell the mobile is in. This is also
useful on the cell site frequencies.  If you hear someone say, "I'm at the
corner of highway FF and 37," and you know where the cell site antenna is in
that area, you can check the frequency listing above and determine what cell
that antenna belongs to.

			       Cellular Security

	Well we know a properly cloned cell phone is virtually impossible
	to detect- or is it?  Security companies rely on matching call
	patterns of subscribers historys to current use. I.E. when 200
	calls to Bum Fuck Egypt show up in a day or 80 long distance
	calls to Culman Alabama show up in a short period, all kinds
	of Flags & whistles go off! The security companies will even
	keep records of people that call numbers that have been previously
	called by Tumbled phones & flag the phone calling that number as
	a potential fraudulent phone. These flags can be set go go off
	by a number of parameters: Number of LD calls per Hr/Day/mo, etc.
	Another method they use is when the real phone places a call & the
	Tumbled phone places another call soon afterwards, but from a
	distance from the 1st call thats impossible to travel in such a
	short period of time. I.E. At 5 P.M. friday phone A calls from
	Manhatten & completes call at 5.10 p.m.  At 5.12 P.M. Cloned phone
	B calls from Queens. No-one can travel those distances in 2 minutes,
	thus that ESN/MIN is tagged as a Clone by the phone company. These
	databases are just now starting to be used in larger cities.
	Some software will track a flagged cell phone from cell site to
	cell site.
	 Commonly used discrepancies cell co software looks for are
	different ESNs, Manufacturer, model, SCMs, etc. that are broadcast
	by the cellular phone on its REVERSE channel. (If one captures
	all that data off the Reverse channel & incorporates it in the
	CLONED phone, detection via this method becomes nearly impossible.)

	Some daring souls have been known to use fake ID & Cards to even
	subscribe to a cellular service, then burn out the phone before
	the first months bill arrives to the unsuspecting real person.

  ****************************************************************************

			       Conclusion

	The future for cellular fraud is wide open. As the secret software
	of the over 300 brands of cellular phones in existance becomes
	"Cracked" and re-written and spread via the underground, Fraud
	will increase like Wildfire. Virtually nothing can be done to
	stop the informed phone phreak as he will change ESN/MINs, etc.
	easily and frequently. A new era not seen since the 2600 hz
	tone was discovered is just now dawning via cellular phreaking.

	Nuff Said,
	Bootleg

	P.S. Since I'm lettin the cat out of the bag for the 1st time
	     here, I hereby dub the box needed to read REVERSE channels
	     the BOO Box! (Shit- after 12 years I finally get to name
	     a box.)  hehe




===============================================================================

           The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 and CMT

===============================================================================

    The ECPA, passed in 1986, is partly responsible for the extreme interest
in CMT monitoring.  After all, if you tell someone they can't listen to these
phone calls, they'll immediately want to do so.  "There must be _something_
going on there that's either interesting or important.  Why else would they
want to keep us from listening?" seems to be the predominant reaction.

    Be assured that it is illegal under the ECPA to listen to cellular phone
calls. This law was passed mainly to satisfy the CMT manufacturers.  They can
now tell their customers that their conversations are 'protected by federal
law.' However, when this law was drawn up, it was obviously felt to be too
narrow in its views, since it protected only one service.  So it was amended
to include various services, such as microwaves, some satellites, broadcast
STL links (studio-transmitter links), and the descrambling of scrambled
signals.

    However, from the very beginning, the government has shown an extremely
bored attitude when it comes to the ECPA.  There is virtually no attempt at
enforcement, unless it's a case involving blackmail, or an overt attempt is
being made to provide radios with CMT-specific frequencies.  In the latter
case, a dealer was modifying the radios he was selling.  After a government
visit, he agreed not to modify the radios, but he was allowed to include
instructions on how to make the modification.  With the Pro-2005 and Pro-2006,
this consists of opening the radio and clipping one diode, an operation that
takes all of 15 minutes, including disassembly.

    What does all this mean?  You can receive any frequency you wish.  There
is literally no way to tell what you're listening to in the privacy of your
home.  Your scanner (as well as EVERY radio) _does_ transmit an extremely
small amount of RF energy from the local oscillator, but unless the radio is
in very bad shape, that energy won't go past 40 or 50 feet.  The "gummint"
would have to drive around in detection vans with beam antennas, and with
100,000 scanner owners, it's an extremely good bet that they're not even going
to consider thinking about the merest possibility that someone might put this
idea forward to be comtemplated.  They've got more important stuff to worry
about.  What it comes down to is this:  listen to whatever you want to, but
don't divulge it or use the information for personal or illegal gain.  That
will get you into deep doo-doo in double-quick time.

    Most people have the opinion that if it's unscrambled, and it's passing
freely through their home and body, that they have the right to receive it.
This sounds like good solid thinking.  The laws of this land provide for just
compensation to individuals.  Perhaps a few bills to CMT companies for
transmission rights would help to remove this silly law from the books.

{ 2518.   Procedure for interception of wire, oral, or electronic
               communications

     (1)  Each application for an order authorizing or approving the
interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication under this chapter
shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of competent
jurisdiction and shall state the applicant's authority to make such
application.  Each application shall include the following information:

          (a)  the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer
     making the application, and the officer authorizing the application;

          (b)  a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances
     relied upon by the applicant, to justify his belief that an order
     should be issued, including (i) details as to the particular offense
     that has been, is being, or is about to be committed, (ii) except as
     provided in subsection (11), a particular description of the nature and
     location of the facilities from which or the place where the
     communication is to be intercepted, (iii) a particular description of
     the type of communications sought to be intercepted, (iv) the identity
     of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose
     communications are to be intercepted;

          (c)  a full and complete statement as to whether or not other
     investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they
     reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too
     dangerous;

          (d)  a statement of the period of time for which the interception
     is required to be maintained.  If the nature of the investigation is
     such that the authorization for interception should not automatically
     terminate when the described type of communication has been first
     obtained, a particular description of facts establishing probable cause
     to believe that additional communications of the same type will occur
     thereafter;

          (e)  a full and complete statement of the facts concerning all
     previous applications known to the individual authorizing and making
     the application, made to any judge for authorization to intercept, or
     for approval of interceptions of, wire, oral, or electronic
     communications involving any of the same persons, facilities or places
     specified in the application; and

          (f)  where the application is for the extension of an order, a
     statement setting forth the results thus far obtained from the
     interception, or a reasonable explanation of the failure to obtain such
     results.

     (2)  The judge may require the applicant to furnish additional
testimony or documentary evidence in support of the application.

     (3)  Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order, as
requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of wire,
oral or electronic communications within the territorial jurisdiction of the
court in which the judge is sitting (and outside that jurisdiction but
within the United States in the case of a mobile interception device
authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction) if the judge
determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that-

          (a)  there is probable cause for belief that an individual is
     committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense
     enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter;

          (b)  there is probable cause for brief that particular
     communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such
     interception;

          (c)  normal investigative procedures have been tried and have
     failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be
     too dangerous;

          (d)  except as provided in subsection (11), there is probable
     cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where the
     wire, oral, or electronic communications are to be intercepted are
     being used, or are about to be used, in connection with the commission
     of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly
     used by such person.

     (4)  Each order authorizing or approving the interception of any wire,
oral, or electronic communication under this chapter shall specify-

          (a)  the identity of the person, if known, whose communications
     are to be intercepted;

          (b)  the nature and location of the communications facilities as
     to which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted;

          (c)  a particular description of the type of communication sought
     to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which
     it relates;

          (d)  the identity of the agency authorized to intercept the
     communications, and of the person authorizing the application; and

          (e)  the period of time during which such interception is
     authorized, including a statement as to whether or not the interception
     shall automatically terminate when the described communication has been
     first obtained.

An order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic
communication under this chapter shall, upon request of the applicant,
direct that a provider of wire or electronic communication service,
landlord, custodian or other person shall furnish the applicant forthwith
all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to
accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference
with the services that such service provider, landlord, custodian, or person
is according the person whose communications are to be intercepted.  Any
provider of wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian or
other person furnishing such facilities or technical assistance shall be
compensated therefor by the applicant for reasonable express incurred in
providing such facilities or assistance.

     (5)  No order entered under this section may authorize or approve the
interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication for any period
longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization nor
in any event longer than thirty days.  Such thirty-day period begins on the
earlier of the day on which the investigative or law enforcement officer
first begins to conduct an interception under the order or ten days after
the order is entered.  Extensions of an order may be granted, but only upon
application for an extension made in accordance with subsection (1) of this
section and the court making the findings required by subsection (3) of this
section.  The period of extension shall be no longer than the authorizing
judge deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was granted and
in no event for longer than thirty days.  Every order and extension thereof
shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be
executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to
minimize the interception of communications not otherwise, subject to
interception under this chapter, and must terminate upon attainment of the
authorized objective, or in any event in thirty days.  In the event the
intercepted communications is in a code or foreign language, and an expert
in that foreign language or code is not reasonably available during the
interception period, minimization may be accomplished as soon as practicable
after such interception.  An interception under this chapter may be
conducted in whole or in part by Government personnel, or by an individual
operating under a contract with the Government, acting under the supervision
of an investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the
interception.

     (6)  Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to
this chapter, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who
issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of
the authorized objective and the need for continued interception.  Such
reports shall be made at such intervals as the judge may require.

     (7)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any
investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the
Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney
General, or by the principal prosecuting attorney of any State or
subdivision thereof acting pursuant of that State, who reasonably determines
that-

          (a)  an emergency situation exists that involves-

               (i)  immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to
          any person;

               (ii)  conspiratorial activities threatening the national
          security interest; or

               (iii)  conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized
          crime,

     that requires a wire, oral, or electronic communication to be
     intercepted before an order authorizing such interception can, with due
     diligence, be obtained, and

          (b)  there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under
     this chapter to authorize such interception.

may intercept such wire, oral, or electronic communication if an application
for an order approving the interception is made in accordance with this
section within forty-eight hours after the interception has occurred, or
begins to occur.  In the absence of an order, such interception shall
immediately terminate when the communication sought is obtained or when the
application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier.  In the event
such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the
interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents
of any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted shall be treated
as having been obtained in violation of this chapter, and an inventory shall
be served as provided for in subsection (d) of this section on the person
named in the application.

     (8)(a)    The contents of any wire, oral, or  electronic communication
intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall, if possible, be
recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device. The recording of the
contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication under this
subsection shall be done in such a way as will protect the recording from
editing or other alterations.  Immediately upon the expiration of the period
of the order, or extensions thereof, such recordings shall be made available
to the judge issuing such order and sealed under this directions.  Custody
of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders.  They shall not be
destroyed except upon an order of the issuing or denying judge and in any
event shall be kept for ten years.  Duplicate recordings may be made for use
or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections (2) and (2) of
section 2517 of this chapter for investigations.  The presence of the seal
provided for by this section, or a satisfactory explanation for the absence
thereof, shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents
of any wire, oral, or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom
under subsection (3) of section 2517.

     (b)  Applications made and orders granted under this chapter shall be
sealed by the judge.  Custody of the applications and orders shall be
wherever the judge directs.  Such applications and orders shall be disclosed
only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent jurisdiction
and shall not be destroyed except on order of the issuing or denying judge,
and in any event shall be kept for ten years.

     (c)  Any violation of the provisions of this subsection may be punished
as contempt of the issuing or denying judge.

     (d)  Within a reasonable time but not  later than ninety days after the
filing of an application for an order of approval under section 2518(7)(b)
which is denied or the termination of the period of an order or extensions
thereof, the issuing or denying judge shall cause to be served, on the
persons named in the order or the application, and such other parties to
intercepted communications as the judge may determine in his discretion that
is in the interest of justice, and inventory which shall include notice of-

          (1)  the fact of the entry of the order or the application;

          (2)  the date of the entry and the period of authorized, approved
     or disapproved interception, or the denial of the application, and

          (3)  the fact that during the period wire, oral, or electronic
     communications were or were not intercepted.

The judge, upon the filing of a motion, may in his discretion make available
to such person or his counsel for inspection such portions of the
intercepted communications, applications and orders as the judge determines
to be in the interest of justice. On an ex parte showing of good cause to a
judge of competent jurisdiction the serving of the inventory required by
this subsection may be postponed.

     (9)  The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication
intercepted pursuant to this chapter or evidence derived therefrom shall not
be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or
other proceeding in a Federal or State court unless each party, not less
then ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished
with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application, under which
the interception was authorized or approved. This ten-day period may be
waived by the judge if he finds that it was not possible to furnish the
party with the above information ten days before the trial, hearing, or
proceeding and that the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in
receiving such information.

     (10)(a)   Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in
or before the any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or
other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision
thereof, may move to suppress the contents of any wire or oral communication
intercepted pursuant to this chapter, or evidence derived therefrom, on the
grounds that-

          (i)  the communication was unlawfully intercepted;

          (ii)  the order of authorization or approval under which it was
          intercepted is insufficient on its face; or

          (iii)  the interception was not made in conformity with the order
          of authorization or approval.

Such motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding unless
there was no opportunity to make such motion or the person was not aware of
the grounds of the motion.  If the motion is granted, the contents of the
intercepted wire or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, shall
be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter.  The judge,
upon the filing of such motion by the aggrieved person, may in his
discretion make available to the aggrieved person or his counsel for
inspection such portions of the intercepted communication or evidence
derived therefrom as the judge determines to be in the interests of justice.

     (b)  In addition to any other right to appeal, the United States shall
have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress made
under paragraph (a) of this subsection, or the denial of an application for
an order of approval, if the United States attorney shall certify to the
judge or other official granting such motion or denying such application the
the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay.  Such appeal shall be taken
within thirty days after the date the order was entered and shall be
diligently prosecuted.

     (c)  The remedies and sanctions described in this chapter with respect
to the interception of electronic communications are the only judicial
remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter
involving such communications.

     (11) The requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d) of the
section relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the
place where, the communication is to be intercepted do not apply if-

          (a)  in the case of an application with respect to the
     interception of an oral communication-

               (i)  the application is by a federal investigative or law
          enforcement officer and is approved by the Attorney General, the
          Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, an
          Assistant Attorney General, or an acting Assistant Attorney
          General;

               (ii)  the application contains a full and complete statement
          as to why such specification is not practical and identifies the
          person committing the offense and whose communications are to be
          intercepted; and

               (iii)  the judge finds that such specification is not
          practical; and

          (b)  in the case of an application with respect to a wire or
     electronic communication-

               (i)  the application is by a Federal investigative or law
          enforcement officer and is approved by the Attorney General, the
          Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, and
          Assistant Attorney General, or an acting Assistant Attorney
          General;

               (ii)  the application identifies the person believed to be
          committing the offense and whose communications are to be
          intercepted and the applicant makes a showing of a purpose, on the
          part of that person, to thwart interception by changing
          facilities; and

               (iii)  the judge finds that such purpose has been adequately
          shown.

     (12) An interception of a communication under an order with respect to
which the requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d) of this section
do not apply by reason of subsection (11) shall not begin until the
facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be
intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing the interception
order.  A provider of wire or electronic communications service that has
received an order as provided for in subsection (11)(b) may move the court
to modify or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with respect
to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable fashion.
The court, upon notice to the government, shall decide such a motion
expeditiously.

{ 2519.   Reports concerning intercepted wire, oral, or electronic
               communications

     (1)  Within thirty days after the expiration of an order (or each

{ 2521.   Injunction against illegal interception

     Whenever it shall appear that any person is engaged or is about to
engage in any act which constitutes or will constitute a felony violation of
this chapter, the Attorney General may initiate a civil action in a district
court of the United States to enjoin such violation.  The court shall
proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination of such an
action, and may, at any time before final determination, enter such a
restraining order or prohibition, or take such other action, as is warranted
to prevent a continuing and substantial injury to the United States or to

governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic
communication service of the contents of an electronic communication, that
is in electronic storage in an electronic communications system for one
hundred and eighty days or less, only pursuant to a warrant issued under the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent State warrant.  A
governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic
communications services of the contents of an electronic communication that
has been in storage in an electronic communications system for more than one
hundred and eighty days by the means available under subsection (b) of this
section.

     (b) CONTENTS OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN A REMOTE COMPUTING
SERVICE.- (1) A governmental entity may require a provider of remote
computing service to disclose the contents of any electronic communication
to which this paragraph is made applicable by paragraph (2) of this
subsection-

     (A) without required notice to the subscriber or customer, if the
governmental entity obtains a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure or equivalent State warrant; or

     (B) with prior notice from the governmental entity to the subscriber or
customer if the governmental entity-

     (i) uses an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or State
statute or a Federal or State grand jury subpoena; or

     (ii) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection (d) of
this section; except that delayed notice may be given pursuant to section
2705 of this title.

     (2) Paragraph (1) is applicable with respect to any electronic
communication that is held or maintained on that service-

     (A) on behalf of, and received by means of electronic transmission from
(or created by means of computer processing of communications received by
means of electronic transmission from), a subscriber or customer of such
remote computing service; and

     (B) solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing
services to such subscriber or customer, if the provider is not authorized
to access the contents of any such communications for purposes of providing
any services other than storage or computer processing.

     (c) RECORDS CONCERNING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SERVICE OR REMOTE
COMPUTING SERVICE.-  (1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a
provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service may
disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or
customer of such service (not including the contents of communications
covered by subsection (a) or (b) of this section) to any person other than a
governmental entity.

     (B) A provider of electronic communication service or remote computing
service shall disclose a record or other information pertaining to a
subscriber to or customer of such service (not including the contents of
communications covered by subsection (a) or (b) of this section) to a
governmental entity only when the governmental entity-

subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall issue only if the governmental
entity shows that there is reason to believe the contents of a wire or
electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are
relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry.  In the case of a State
governmental authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by
the law of such State.  A court issuing an order pursuant to this section,
on a motion made promptly by the service provider, may quash or modify such
order, if the information or records requested are unusually voluminous in
nature or compliance with such order otherwise would cause an undue burden
on such provider.

     (e) NO CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST A PROVIDER DISCLOSING INFORMATION UNDER
THIS CHAPTER.- No cause of action shall lie in any court against any
provider of wire or electronic communication service, its officers,
employees, agents, or other specified persons for providing information,

{ 2704. Backup preservation

     (a) BACKUP PRESERVATION.- (1) A governmental entity acting under
section 2703(b)(2) may include in its subpoena or court order a requirement
that the service provider to whom the request is directed create a backup
copy of the contents of the electronic communications sought in order to
preserve those communications.  Without notifying the subscriber or customer
of such subpoena or court order, such service provider shall create such
backup copy as soon as practicable consistent with its regular business
practices and shall confirm to the governmental entity that such backup copy
has been made.  Such backup copy shall be created within two business days
after receipt by the service provider of the subpoena or court order.

     (2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the
governmental entity within three days after receipt of such confirmation,
unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 2705(a).

     (3) The service provider shall not destroy such backup copy until the
later of --

     (A) the delivery of the information; or

     (B) the resolution of any proceedings (including appeals of any
proceeding) concerning the government's subpoena or court order.

     (4) The service provider shall release such backup copy to the
requesting governmental entity no sooner than fourteen days after the
governmental entity's notice to the subscriber or customer if such service
provider --

     (A) has not received notice from the subscriber or customer that the
subscriber or customer has challenged the governmental entity's request; and

     (B) has not initiated proceedings to challenge the request of the
governmental entity.

     (5) A governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a backup
copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section if in its sole discretion such
entity determines that there is reason to believe that notification under
section 2703 of this title of the existence of the subpoena or court order
may result in destruction of or tampering with evidence.  This determination
is not subject to challenge by the subscriber or customer or service
provider.

     (b) CUSTOMER CHALLENGES -- (1) Within fourteen days after notice by the
governmental entity to the subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2) of
this section, such subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash such
subpoena or vacate such court order, with copies served upon the
governmental entity and with written notice of such challenge to the service
provider.  A motion to vacate a court order shall be filed in the court
which issued such order.  A motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the
appropriate United States district court or State court. Such motion or
application shall contain an affidavit or sworn statement --

     (A) stating that the applicant is a customer or subscriber to the
service from which the contents of electronic communications maintained for
him have been sought; and

     (B) stating the applicant's reasons for believing that the records
sought are not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that
there has not been substantial inquiry or that there has not been
substantial compliance with the provisions of this chapter in some other
respect.

     (2) Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental entity
by delivering or mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of the
papers to the person, office, or department specified in the notice which
the customer has received pursuant to this chapter.  For the purposes of
this section, the term "delivery" has the meaning given that term in the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

     (3) If the court finds that the customer has complied with paragraphs
(1) an (2) of this subsection, the court shall order the governmental entity
to file a sworn response, which may be filed in camera if the governmental
entity includes in its response the reasons which make in camera review
appropriate.  If the court is unable to determine the motion or application
on the basis of the parties' initial allegations and response, the court may
conduct such additional proceedings as it deems appropriate. All such
proceedings shall be completed and the motion or application decided as soon
as practicable after the filing of the governmental entity's response.

     (4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or
customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are
maintained, or that there is a reason to believe that the law enforcement
inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought are relevant to
that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and order such process
enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or
customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are
maintained, and that there is not a reason to believe that the
communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry,
or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of
this chapter, it shall order the process quashed.

     (5) A court order denying a motion or application under this section
shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutory appeal may be taken
therefrom by the customer.

request, which the court shall grant, for an order delaying the notification
required under section 2703(b) of this title for a period not to exceed
ninety days, if the court determines that there is reason to believe that
notification of the existence of the court order may have an adverse result
described in paragraph (2) of this subsection; or

     (B) where an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or State
statute or a Federal or State grand jury subpoena is obtained, delay the
notification required under section 2703(b) of this title for a period not
to exceed ninety days upon the execution of a written certification of a
supervisory official that there is reason to believe that notification of
the existence of the subpoena may have an adverse result described in
paragraph (2) of this subsection.

     (2) An adverse result for the purposes of paragraph (1) of this
subsection is --

     (A) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual;

     (B) flight from prosecution;

delaying a trial.

     (3) The governmental entity shall maintain a true copy of certification
under paragraph (1)(B).

up to ninety days each may be granted by the court upon application, or by
certification by a governmental entity, but only in accordance with
subsection (b) of this section.

paragraph (1) or (4) of this subsection, the governmental entity shall serve
upon, or deliver by registered or first-class mail to, the customer or
subscriber a copy of the process or request together with notice that --

     (A) states with reasonable specificity the nature of the law
enforcement inquiry; and

     (B) informs such customer or subscriber --

     (i) that information maintained for such customer or subscriber by the
service provider named in such process or request was supplied to or
requested by that governmental authority and the date on which the supplying
or request took place.

     (ii) that notification of such customer or subscriber was delayed;

     (iii) what governmental entity or court made the certification or
determination pursuant to which that delay was made; and

     (iv) which provision of this chapter allowed such delay.

the investigative agent in charge or assistant investigative agent in charge
or an equivalent of an investigating agency's headquarters or regional
office, or the chief prosecuting attorney or the first assistant prosecuting
attorney or an equivalent of a prosecuting attorney's headquarters or
regional office.

     (b) PRECLUSION OF NOTICE TO SUBJECT OF GOVERNMENTAL ACCESS. -- A
governmental entity acting under section 2703, when it is not required to
notify the subscriber or customer under section 2703(b)(1), or to the extent
that it may delay such notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this section,
may apply to a court for an order commanding a provider of electronic
communications service or remote computing service to whom a warrant,
subpoena, or court order is directed, for such period as the court deems
appropriate, not to notify any other person of the existence of the warrant,
subpoena, or court order.  The court shall enter such an order if it
determines that there is reason to believe that notification of the
existence of the warrant, subpoena, or court order will results in --

     (1) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual;

     (2) flight from prosecution;

     (3) destruction of or tampering with evidence;

such information would be brought, if no court order was issued for
production of the information).

     (c) The requirement of subsection (a) of this section does not apply
with respect to records or other information maintained by a communications
common carrier that relate to telephone toll records and telephone listings
obtained under section 2703 of this title.  The court may, however, order a

                WHEN IS LISTENING TO THE RADIO A CRIME?

                         By FRANK TERRANELLA

    The federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act has turned many radio
listeners into criminals.  The problem is, most of them don't know about it. I
will attempt here to describe in very non-legalistic and general terms
(extremely difficult for a lawyer), exactly what listening is legal and what
is illegal.

    Section 2511 of the Federal Criminal Statutes (18 U.S.C.) is where most of
the action is in this field.  The statute is primarily a wiretap and bug
statute and only recently has been expanded to include radio listening.  I
will not be discussing the provisions dealing with oral communications or
wiretaps and bugging devices here.

    The statute starts out by saying that it is illegal to intentionally
intercept, disclose or use the contents of any wire or electronic
communication.  The statute then goes on to carve out exceptions to this
general rule.

    It is important to understand what the law means by wire or electronic
communication.  A wire communication is any communication over a telephone or
other wire.  However, the definition specifically includes cellular telephones
and excludes cordless telephones (even though both involve the use of radio
and wire transmission).  An electronic communication includes all radio
transmissions, but excludes cordless telephones and pagers.

    After making a blanket prohibition of intercepting all electronic (i.e.
radio) transmissions, the statute lists the exceptions.  The first exception
is that it is legal to listen to all radio transmissions which are "readily
accessible to the general public."  This term is defined in the statute to
mean radio signals which are (1) not encrypted, scrambled, carried on a
subcarrier or other signal subsidiary to a radio transmission; (2) not
transmitted over a common carrier communications system (such as the phone
company); (3) not special transmissions such as point-to-point private relay
transmissions for the broadcast services, not meant for reception by the
general public.

    The next exception to the general rule is that it is legal to listen to
all radio broadcasts "relating to ships, aircraft, vehicles or persons in
distress." The statute also says that it is legal to listen to a broadcast by
any governmental, law enforcement, civil defense, private land mobile or
public safety communications system, including police and fire, which are
readily accessible to the general public.  It is also legal to listen to
transmissions on the amateur bands, citizens band or general mobile radio
services as well as any marine or aeronautical communications system and
cordless telephone transmission.

    Finally, it is not illegal to intercept satellite transmissions of cable
programming as long as the transmission is not encrypted, there is no monetary
gain by the viewer, and there is no marketing system available (meaning no one
is selling the rights to view the programming via satellite).

    There is also an interesting section of the statute which may provide a
loophole for lawyers defending clients charged with a violation of this law.
The statute says that it is not illegal to intercept a radio transmission
which is causing interference with any lawfully operating station (including
ham radio operators), or is causing interference with any consumer electronic
equipment, to the extent necessary to identify the source of the interference.
I can see a lawyer arguing that his client was only listening to that cellular
telephone transmission because it was interfering with his client's reception
on the 23 centimeter band.

    After all of the exceptions are carved out, the bottom line is that the
only radio frequency transmissions which are off limits are those which are
not readily accessible to the general public, as that term is defined in the
statute.  The definition of "readily accessible to the general public" is
stated in the statute as follows:

     (a)  not scrambled or encrypted;

     (b)  not transmitted using modulation techniques whose essential
          parameters have been withheld from the public with the intention of
          preserving the privacy of such communication;

     (c)  not carried on a subcarrier or other signal subsidiary to a radio
          transmission;

     (d)  not transmitted over a communication system provided by a common
          carrier, unless the communication is a tone only paging system
          communication;

     (e)  not transmitted on frequencies allocated under part 25; subpart
          D,E, or F of part 74; or part 94 of the Rules of the Federal
          Communications Commission, unless, in the case of a communication
          transmitted on a frequency allocated under part 74 that is not
          exclusively allocated to broadcast auxiliary services, the
          communication is a two-way voice communication by radio.

    The first two of these are no problem.  If the signal is scrambled,
law-abiding DXers will leave it alone.  Paragraph (c) begins the real
restrictions on DXers.  Under the statutory definition, signals on a
subcarrier, such as the types being experimented with in television at the
moment, are not readily accessible to the general public and are not permitted
listening.

    The next section poses the greatest problem for DXers.  Under the
definition, any signal, other than a tone, which is transmitted by a common
carrier is off limits.  The FCC defines a common carrier as "any person
engaged in rendering communication service for hire to the public." (47 CFR
21.2) The statutory definition given in 47 U.S.C. 153(h) is a bit more
specific in that it specifically excludes radio broadcasters who, through sale
of commercials, do render a communication service for hire.  But, even with
the removal of broadcasters, this definition is very broad and will include,
beyond obvious services such as cellular telephone, just about every utility
station on the face of the earth.

    The types of radio transmissions made off limits to DXers by paragraph (e)
are certain satellite communications, certain microwave communications, and
auxiliary stations to broadcasters used for such things as feeds from the
mobile van back to the studio or from the studio to the transmitter. The
frequencies of these services are all above 1 Gigahertz except for the bands
928-929 MHz and 944-960 Mhz.  The exception to this is the frequency
assignment given to remote broadcast pickup stations under subpart D of part
74.  This service, which is off-limits to DXers, is assigned bits and pieces
of the radio spectrum from 1606 kHz through 455.925 Mhz.  Twenty-six
frequencies in the shortwave bands are allocated to this service.  The
allocations are scattered between 25.87 Mhz and 26.47 Mhz, but unless you have
a copy of the FCC Rules and Regulations, there is no easy way for a DXer to
know that listening to these transmissions is a federal offense.

    This is precisely why I maintain that this law is unenforceable.  In order
for a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 2511 to be successful, the government must
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the DXer intentionally intercepted a
protected transmission.  Since even attorneys are unsure what frequencies are
off-limits, how can the government hope to prove that a DXer who happens upon
one of these federally-legislated minefields in the radio spectrum, actually
intended to do so?

    It should be noted that the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 605) has
not been repealed by the new law.  It is still illegal, as it has been since
at least 1934, to divulge the contents of any transmission except for general
broadcast stations, amateur radio and CB transmissions, and transmissions
relating to ships, aircraft, vehicles or persons in distress. A recent case
(Edwards v. State Farm Insurance Co., 833 F.2d 535) concluded that in order to
prove an offense under this statute, the speaker must have held a subjective
expectation of privacy that was justifiable under the circumstances.

    I hope that this brief trip through the legal maze of communications
privacy has been useful.  I can see the day coming when some industrious
lawyer, defending a client of means, decides to challenge this unjust law. The
basis is very simple.  Just as there is no Fourth Amendment right of privacy
where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy, so too there should not
be a statutory right of privacy where anyone with a receiver can listen in.
To use an analogy, the providers of cellular service want the right to parade
down Main Street with no clothes on and then prosecute anyone who looks.  This
is simply unfair and unrealistic.

    And beyond that, our First Amendment freedom of speech has a corollary
freedom to be informed and to gather information.  This freedom must extend to
the spoken as well as the printed word, as long as no reasonable expectations
of privacy are violated.  Anyone with a receiver should be entitled to hear
anything which is broadcast in the clear over the "public" airwaves for the
simple reason that it is not reasonable for anyone to transmit in this manner
and expect this transmission to be private.  An expectation of privacy can
only be achieved by scrambling the signal, not by governmental decree.

             Modifying two scanners for cellular reception

===============================================================================

    The word "modifying" in this case is wrong.  That implies that there is a
_conversion_ process whereby you can cause your scanner to suddenly begin
receiving cellular mobile telephone calls.  This is wrong thinking.  A scanner
that is _designed_ to receive those frequencies above 512 MHz can have those
frequencies RESTORED (_sometimes_).  A scanner that covers from 30-512 MHz can
NEVER receive 800-900 MHz frequencies without the aid of an external RF
converter.  Many times you will see messages from people asking how to modify
such-and-such a receiver to pick up CMT.  The sad truth is, the answer is $$$,
as that's what it will take to get a new scanner that covers those
frequencies.

    Some older scanners (most of them in fact) have no modifications so that
they will cover these frequencies.  There may be cosmetic changes, such as the
addition of an S-meter, or squelch or tone improvement, but there will never,
ever be anything that can be done to most of them to make them cover CMT.  The
PRO-2004/2005/34 receivers originally had those frequencies, but had them
blocked out.  Restoring those frequencies was simply a matter of _unblocking_
them.  There was really no "modifying" taking place.  If a scanner was never
intended to cover 800 MHz, it never will.  You can get RF converters that will
convert 800-912 MHz down to 400-512 MHz, however, and these should work on all
scanners.

MOST SCANNERS CANNOT BE MODIFIED OR CHANGED TO RECEIVE THE CMT FREQUENCIES.

    There are a handful of exceptions to this.  It started out with the
Realistic PRO-2004 and the PRO-34, and went to the PRO-2005.  To restore CMT
for the 2004, open the radio and turn it upside down.  You'll see a large
metal box. Carefully remove the cover.  Find diode D-513.  It may be in the
line of diodes, or it may be on the bottom of the PC board, in which case
you'll have to VERY carefully remove the board.  In either case, the cure is
the same. Clip one leg of D-513 to restore CMT frequencies.

    If you're careful, you can unsolder this diode and place it in the empty
spot at D-510. That will give you 400 channels instead of 300.

    For the PRO-2005, the procedure is the same, except you clip one leg of
D-502 to restore cellular reception.  In the 2004, put a 1N914 diode in D-514
and you'll increase your scan/search speed by 25%.  Watch your diode polarity!
For the PRO-2005, it's D-501, which is on the display board behind the
keyboard. Adding D-504 to the PRO-2005 will DELETE 66-88 MHz coverage -- TV
channels, radio control, etc., so don't add D-504!!!!  As far as is known,
there is no channel expansion capability on the order of the PRO-2004 for the
PRO-2005.  400 channels appears to be its limit.

    The PRO-34 handheld can also have CMT restored, and all can be modified to
receive 6,400 channels (3,200 on the PRO-34), but that's beyond the capability
of this article.  I could have typed in the directions for restoring CMT to
the PRO-34, but you really need pictures to go with the modification.  The
original article was in "Popular Communications." All these are described in
great detail in the "Scanner Modification Handbook" by Bill Cheek, available
from CRB Research Books, Inc., PO Box 56, Commack, New York, 11725.  It's
$17.95 + $2.00 postage and handling, but is well worth the price due to the
treasure trove of info that's in it.

                  How to discover other scanner modifications

===============================================================================

                HOW TO 'DISCOVER' THOSE NEAT RADIO MODIFICATIONS



    How do the people that discover modifications to radios go about finding
them?  Good question!

    The first rule of thumb is to obtain service manuals, as they contain more
than just troubleshooting information.  For example, the alignment procedure
outlined in the Regency K500 and M400 service manuals describes how to
circumvent the frequency limit checking firmware, which allows out of band
frequency programming.  The Uniden 200/205XLT service manual describes a
keyboard sequence that clears most of the 200 memory channels, and loads the
others with bizarre test frequencies.

    Service manuals often describe the circuit changes in models intended for
export to other countries.  This can reveal features disabled for some
customers but  enabled for others.

    A good library of IC and semiconductor data books is very helpful,
although radio service manuals can also include IC internal diagrams. Old TTL
databooks are no longer enough.  The transition to surface mount components in
radios like the Uniden/Bearcat 760XLT is motivation for acquiring data books
for leadless components.

    Although some modifications involve discovery of "hidden" features, many
others involve designing new circuitry or applying old circuitry from another
radio.  I can't claim credit for many "add/delete a diode" modifications, but
here are the factors that accounted for a few other modifications.

              ***** Recognize Common Radio Circuits *****

Modification:  Improve the squelch on the PRO-24, PRO-2004, 800XLT, etc.
Motivation: Unsatisfied with stock performance.

    Almost all modern scanners use MC3357, MC3359, or Japanese pin equivalent
chips, which contain the IF, squelch, limiter & discriminator circuitry.
Older Bearcat and Regency scanners, like the BC300 and M400, often hid the
identity of their IC with "house numbers" painted over them.  I compared these
ICs pin for pin with the MC3357 and other known radio ICs to unmask their true
identity.  Having the Motorola IC data sheet and scanner service manuals made
learning the chip internals easy, so I found the way to decrease hysteresis
involved changing one resistor.

                         ***** Be Curious *****

Modification: Trick the Icom R-71A to tune below 100 kHz.
Motivation: Curiosity.

    Tried manipulating several front panel controls at the same time to see if
I could confuse the microprocessor into doing something neat.  I did.

         ***** Study the Schematic, Look for Unused Pins *****

Modification:  Double the memory in the R-7000 (also published by another
               radio hobbyist).
Motivation: curiosity.

    I studied the schematic of the R-7000, and looked up the memory IC in a
data book.  Icom grounded an address lead, so only 1/2 the  chip capacity was
used.  Not having enough time to try the idea on my own radio, I suggested the
idea Jack Albert, who writes the RTTY column in "Monitoring Times", who used
his R-7000 as a guinea pig.

          ***** Borrow Circuits from Other Radio Models *****

Modification:  S-meter circuit for Bearcat scanners (unpublished).
Motivation:  wanted to use scanners for transmitter hunting.

    I looked for other radios that used the same IF/squelch chip and already
featured S-meters (like the Kenwood TR- 2600A, IC-28A, IC228H, etc.) I grafted
their S-meter circuitry to my scanners.

           ***** Vary Parameters and Measure the Impact *****

Modification: Speed up the R-7000 scan rate.
Motivation: dissatisfied with stock performance.

    I studied the radio schematic, found the components that determined scan
rate, and substituted various values of resistance, measuring the affect of
each change.

                    ***** Apply Simple Theory *****

Modification: COR light for  the  PRO-2004.
Motivation: make scanner easier to use in a roomful of other active radios.

    Having studied the schematics of many scanners, I was familiar with FM
receiver and scanner circuitry.  I used service manual and found the proper
point in the circuit where a logic level signal was produced depending on
whether a signal was absent or present.  Again, the PRO-2004 used a popular
IF/squelch chip.  I used the simplest transistor switching principles to
design a COR light circuit.

                   ***** Fashion a Test Harness *****

    Marvin Moss used an interesting approach to explore his portable scanner.
He wired the diodes in the diode matrix of his Radio Shack PRO-34 to separate
DIP switches so he could experiment with switching in and out different
combinations of diodes.

               ***** All That Glitters is Not Gold *****

    I always find other peoples' modifications very interesting, although not
all are meritorious.  For instance, avoid changing the crystal or RC time
constant circuitry used as a clock for the microprocessor controller in your
receiver.  The controller performs many functions, so this alteration can
produce undesirable side effects which outweigh any small increase in scan
rate.
