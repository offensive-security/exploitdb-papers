                A CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS PRIMER


                         By Damien Thorn



                          INTRODUCTION

The specific technologies involved in the cellular network are
highly complex, comprised of a vast array of computers, control
equipment, transceivers, multiplexers, switching equipment, etc. 
The theory and principals of operation which we'll cover here are
much easier to comprehend.  With this article you'll learn the
basics, and how you can profit from that understanding.  Next
month I'll show you how to reprogram a cellular phone through the
keypad. 
Cellular telephones are viewed by most users as simply another
phone, albeit cordless.  A cellular mobile telephone (CMT)
emulates a landline set so credibly that the deepest technical
concern for most people is remembering how to make the phone dial
a frequently called number stored in memory.  The comfort and
familiarity of the phones are by design, I'm sure.  To a public
that has difficulty programming a VCR, the reality of cellular
technology would be overwhelming and perhaps somewhat
frightening.

Cellular phones are little more than low power transceivers
capable of transmitting and receiving a total of 666 or 832
frequencies, depending on the model.  They operate in a
full-duplex mode, transmitting the mobile side of the
conversation on one frequency while simultaneously receiving  the
other side from the cell site on a different frequency.  A basic
multi-channel two-way radio under the control of some powerful
software.  The network itself is where the engineering genius
becomes apparent.


                OVERVIEW OF NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

The cellular network consists of a honeycomb of transceiver sites
(towers), each capable of handling up to about 40 separate
cellular calls.  Each site has an effective range of 3-5 miles. 
The term "cell" is derived from the size and shape of the site's
coverage pattern, and the arrangement of the cell sites.  The
various sites in each city are all linked together through the
mobile telephone switching office (MTSO).  The MTSO not only
coordinates the use of the radio spectrum, but utilizes computers
to authenticate a subscriber's phone before making the connection
and maintains billing records.  The MTSO also serves as the
interface point with the landline telephone company for cellular
calls.

As you drive through town the MTSO monitors the relative signal
strength of the transmission from your phone.  When the signal
strength becomes higher in any cell other than the one handling
your call, the MTSO uses a frequency known as a control channel
to transmit data to your phone telling it to switch frequencies
and lock into another cell.  This "hand off" from one cell to
another happens so quickly that most people never notice the
transition from one frequency or cell site to the next.  This is
noteworthy because the hand off required your phone to change
transmit and receive frequencies, while the cellular network not
only reestablished radio contact with you on another transceiver,
but rerouted the landline audio to that cell site as well.

The cell site is generally located in the center of the cell. 
This is where the antennas, transceivers and control equipment
are located that serve that cell.  Due to the limited coverage
area of the cell, these cell sites are located a maximum of ten
miles from each other to provide uninterrupted coverage without
"dead spots" - areas where your phone cannot operate because
you're out of range of a cell.

Since most markets are served by two cellular service providers
who do not share cell sites, there are actually twice as many
cells (and cell sites) than would be required for one provider to
supply service.  In the past I've worked at radio station
transmitter sites that leased tower space to cellular companies,
but I never realized how prolific these cell sites were until I
studied the technology and looked closely at the antennas around
me.  Where ever your phone works, you're within three to five
(line of sight) miles of a at least two sites, and probably more
since coverage areas overlap.  The adjacent cells never share
common frequencies to avoid interference. 
Cellular sites come in different forms.  In congested
metropolitan areas the transceiver sites may be located on taller
buildings.  In other areas they are located on stand alone
towers.  Towers can either be built by the cellular carrier for
their exclusive use, or the cellular antenna array can share a
common tower (an "antenna farm") with other radio and broadcast
services. 




No matter where the antennas are located, they can be recognized
easily by their unique three- sided configuration.   Refer to the
accompanying photos for examples of two common types of cellular
arrays.  When I asked both cellular carriers based in Sacramento
to disclose the location of their cell sites in my area, they
refused.  The customer relations representatives indicated the
information was confidential - almost a trade secret.  I left
voice mail messages with their engineers describing the
information I wanted.  Neither even returned my call. 
The implications of this guarded attitude are interesting, and
more than a bit disconcerting.  Fortunately the FCC maintains
public records on all transmitter licensees, and the California
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) requires cellular companies to
file abstracts with them containing the information I wanted. 
The CPUC even told me the name of the person who would be
available to help me dig through the abstracts and make
photocopies.  I didn't bother, but it was nice to see my tax
dollars at work for my benefit. 
                      OPERATING FREQUENCIES

The frequency spectrum allocated by the FCC used by the phone to
transmit voice and data to the cell site is 824.000 - 849.000
Mhz.  The tower transmits to the phone on a spectrum of the same
size from 869.000 to 894.000 Mhz.  The cellular frequencies are
narrow band FM, all spaced 30 Khz apart, so determining every
specific frequency is a matter of simple addition. 

For example, knowing the lowest frequency used by a cell site is
869.000 Mhz, simply increment upward in 30 Khz steps:  869.030,
869.060, 869.090, 869.120, etc.  The frequencies used by the
phone for transmission to the tower increment upward the same way
from 824.000 Mhz. 
The frequencies are paired so that the phone is always
transmitting to the tower on a frequency exactly 45 Mhz lower
than the frequency the tower is using.  If the landline (base)
side of the call is transmitted to the phone on 887.940 Mhz, then
the phone is simultaneously transmitting the mobile side of the
call back to the cell site on 842.940 Mhz.   


Cell sites generally transmit the mobile side of the call at
reduced gain back to the cellular phone along with the audio from
the landline side of the call.  This can be intentional, as in
the "side tone" present in a standard landline telephone
receiver, or the result of poor nulling where the cellular
network interfaces with the Telco lines.   This means anyone with
a receiver or scanner capable of tuning the upper frequency in
the pair can monitor both sides of the conversation.  It is
illegal to do so, however.





                 CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY

To calm fears that cellular calls were not private, the cellular
industry lobbied congress into passing legislation known today as
the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 which
makes it a crime to monitor cellular phone calls and a host of
other transmissions like digital pagers.  This law is used by
cellular equipment dealers and service providers to reassure
customers that their conversations will remain private.

A person using a cellular phone is broadcasting his private
conversation on airwaves owned by the general public.  These
radio signals permeate our homes, bodies, and scanning receivers. 
Yet so complete is the cellular transceiver's emulation of an
actual telephone that the general public  not only expects
privacy, but feels confident that the call is secure.  Nobody
could possibly be sitting in the privacy of their living room
monitoring the conversation.  That would be a Federal crime.

The ECPA has been described as a "toothless tiger" as it is
virtually unenforceable.  A growing number of scanner enthusiasts
are monitoring cellular calls rather than the local fire
department because it is much more entertaining.  The ECPA is
ignored by the public and law enforcement alike, just like the
laws remaining on the books that make it illegal to work on
Sunday. 


The bottom line is that it is up to you and I to ensure the
privacy of our cellular calls.  If you don't want to use a
scrambling system, simply don't talk about anything on a cellular
phone that you wouldn't discuss using your rig on the amateur
bands.

                     TELEPHONE CONTROL DATA

With this simplified overview of the cellular network under your
belt, let's dig a little deeper into the data exchanged by the
cellular carrier and your phone.  Obviously there is more
information being sent by your phone to the cellular company than
your conversation.  The service provider needs to identify your
physical phone, cellular phone number, etc.  This is accomplished
via data transmitted by your phone on a  frequency set aside as a
"data channel" in each cell every time you turn it on or use it.

Your phone transmits six pieces of information to the cellular
provider.   One is the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) of your
phone.

Every cellular phone is assigned an ESN when manufactured.  This
ESN consists of numerical data which identify the manufacturer of
the phone as well as the actual unique serial number of the
specific phone.  The ESN is an eleven digit (decimal) number
which has been burned into a PROM chip permanently installed in
the phone.  Like the Vehicle ID Number (VIN) on your car, it is
not designed to be removed or modified, although hackers
occasionally do in order to circumvent billing procedures (see
sidebar).

One other item transmitted is your Mobile Identification Number
(MIN) which is the actual ten digit area code and telephone
number assigned to your phone.  The remainder are numerical codes
used by the cell site to identify things like your class of
service and the specific capabilities of your phone hardware. 
This data is supplied when you activate service with the carrier.
  
The ESN and MIN are matched and checked by computer against a
database each time you use the phone to ensure that you are a
valid subscriber, or roaming from a system the carrier can bill
for your calls.
  
All of this information (except the ESN) is provided by the
cellular carrier and programmed into your phone when you
subscribed to their service.  The vast majority of cellular
phones manufactured today are reprogrammable through the handset. 
This means that you can change (reprogram) this information
yourself without costly programming devices simply by entering
the proper keystrokes on the telephone handset, and punching in
the data. 
This knowledge opens up a number of possibilities.  If you
activate or change your cellular service, you can program the
phone yourself with data supplied by the cellular carrier and
save paying any type of reprogramming fee.  If you're looking to
acquire equipment, you can canvass flea markets, swap meets and
the pages of classified ad magazines such as Nuts & Volts for
great deals on used phones.  Not only will you enjoy savings on
the hardware, but you'll only need to pay the cellular company to
activate service, since you can program the phone yourself. 
In my article next month in Nuts & Volts I'll explain all the
data programmed into a phone, explain what it means, and lead you
step by step through the handset programming of a popular phone. 
This information is an important reference for those who may just
want to do something simple like change the unlock code on the
phone.  We'll also take a look at the publications available
through Nuts & Volts advertisers that explain cellular telephone
reprogramming and modification in depth.

                    BUYING USED CELLULAR GEAR

                          A FEW CAVEATS





When shopping the classifieds, flea markets and electronics swap
meets for great deals on used cellular telephones, keep the
following points in mind to avoid getting "burned." 
Cellular phones are a major target of theft in some cities.  They
appeal to criminals such as drug dealers because they allow
anonymous and virtually untraceable communication from a vehicle
or street corner.  The phone is discarded as useless when the
service is disconnected, and such units may unwittingly be resold
with other used equipment.  There is no real way to discern this
other than to phone your local cellular service provider to see
if the phone's ESN is flagged in their computer as having been
stolen.

The other type of phone to avoid is one that has been physically
modified.  Hackers have been known to replace the factory PROM
chip containing the ESN with a custom burned chip, thus changing
the ESN.  If this is done for the purpose of fraudulently making
free calls, the ESN chip must be changed periodically as the
cellular carrier discovers the fraud associated with that ESN.




Detection of this type of modification is easy.  Cellular
manufacturers as a rule do NOT use a socket to hold the ESN chip. 
The PROM is usually not only soldered to the board, but sealed in
epoxy or "air welded" to the circuit board to discourage this
type of modification.  An IC socket is usually installed by the
hacker to facilitate easy insertion of updated PROM as necessary.

No reputable service center will repair a phone if it appears
someone has tampered with the ESN, and might call the police if
presented with such a phone.

The vast majority of equipment you'll find on the open market is
genuine surplus or used merchandise.  With the above information
in mind you can examine the phone and be confident about your
decision to make a purchase.
