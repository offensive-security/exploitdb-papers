LETTER FROM THE EDITOR:

        Well as some of you may have heard or read, I have had a 
little run-in with the law and Bell Atlantic Security. That is all 
over now and CAFBL is almost back to normal, except for the lose of
our world headquarters, my BBS, The Hacker Crackdown. Well from being
interrogated I learned some good information that I would like to pass
along, and I will do so in this issue. Also I will put to rest all the
rumors surrounding what happened to me with the article I have written
to tell the truth about what happened.


CAFBL NEWS:

        We have lost our WHQ, The Hacker Crackdown. It was permanently
shut down to circumstances beyond my control. Our new WHQ will most 
likely be Dog'N'Dirt's BBS, The Phreakers Pen, when it becomes fully
operational. Right now it also has an 800 number set to it. That will
be released later when it is fully operational. Along the line of 
BBS's, we have also gained a new distro site in 215, the Spiral Abyss. 
The sysop of the Spiral Abyss is Key Master a CAFBL member. The number
is listed in the updated CAFBL.NFO file. Which you will find packaged
inside of this ZIP file.

UNDERGROUND NEWS:

From City Paper (Philadelphia) 3/2/95.  For those of you who haven't seen
the paper, they have a section called Hit and Run, which contains short
stories of local interest.

Railroaded by Howard Altman

     Amtrak police tell Hit & Run that they will "be on hand" Friday
night to "monitor" a monthly meeting of computer hackers at 30th Street
Station.
     Their statement confirms rumors flying around the world of
so-called cyberpunks who make up the 2600 Club -- a group of mostly
young computer enthusiasts with a reputation, deserved or otherwise, for
monkeying around with computer networks and telephone systems. The group
meets 7 p.m. the first Friday of every month at Stairwell 7. The
meetings coincide with others across the nation.
     A source close to the club told Hit & Run that Amtrak police were
alerted to the club's activities after last month's meeting, when some
club members went "tunneling" -- exploring train tunnels where a number
of key telephone lines are located.
     However, Amtrak police deny that, saying they never heard of the
group until contacted by Hit & Run.
     "We have a private outfit that handles social functions," an Amtrak
flak said upon our first inquiry into the 2600 Club meeting. When
informed that the club was made up of alleged hackers and phone
phreakers, spokesman Rick Remington said that while Amtrak police "have
had no previous encounter with the group, on Friday night our police
will be on standby."

Whatever Happened To...?

Amtrak Police frisk hackers.

     Last week, we told you about the Amtrak police department's plans
to "be on hand" during the monthly meeting of a computer hackers' club
that meets at 30th Street Station.
     Well, the man didn't lie.
     As promised, Amtrak police were on hand. But, according to club
members, not only did the Amtrak police observe, they frisked club
members, searched their bags, asked for identification and told members
that future meetings were cancelled.
     "There were about 20 people who attended," said a 2600 club member
who asked to be identified only as Bernie S. "At around 5: 30 p.m., as
each person came up to the meeting, they were approached by the
officers. It was very unfair. We were being singled out."
     Bernie S., a 33-year-old self-described computer consultant, said
the group is considering taking legal action against Amtrak for
violating club members' right to lawful assembly.
     "We were doing nothing illegal," said S. "Just because our views
 are unpopular is not a reason to single us out."
     S. added that, each month, club members spend more than $100
patronizing the station businesses.
     "This is the kind of economic activity the mayor is looking for,"
said S. "I don't know what right they have to stop us from meeting in a
building rehabilitated with public funds where trains paid for in part
by public funds are operated."
     "There are restrictions on public use, said Amtrak flak Rick
Remington, who added that it is up to Amtrak police to determine those
restrictions."
     Remington added that the official police report differs from the
hackers' account.
     The Amtrak version has officers approaching club members at 9 p.m.,
and only after several members were using the phones.
     "We noticed that they were using the phones heavily," said
Remington. "That was unusual. That was our concern."
     The club members, said Remington, were asked to move on or leave.
About 15 left the station, he said, with another 15 or so patronizing
the businesses.
     Remington said he knew of only one instance where a club member was
searched and that was with permission. As for 2600 members being
frisked, asked for identification or having their tickets inspected,
Remington could not comment. He did, however, say that the club members
were asked why they remained in the station after their trains had left.
     When asked how police knew who missed what trains if the tickets
weren't inspected, Remington said, "Basically, they were aware that
trains leaving north or south or to Atlantic City had left."
     Remington added that "law enforcement authorities are familiar with
this club." He refused to speculate on what that means.


BELL ATLANTIC'S _SNEAKY_ CN/A SERVICE BY MORPHEUS:

So you want Answers to the Questions...

1.] Get some fake info from your imagination and a telephone number 
    you would like searched and I tell you '_you_ can sneak info from 
    _their_ CN/A!'
2.] Now get on your phone and clear your mind. You will trick them and 
    they will never know the better. This is very sneaky and certainly 
    not as good as having an actual CN/A number of your very own.
3.] Call a Bell Atlantic Services division, business, private, 
    whatever. Pretend you want info on a service <pick one> the way 
    they get you off the line faster is by asking only for your t-phone 
    # and not your whole, long, wordy address. When they ask for 
    _your_ phone #, give them the _other_ phone number, then they'll 
    say, `Mr. SexRabbit, is your number issued to MysteryTelco 
    corporation?' Note, they will only say this if they are stupid and 
    think your last name is SexRabbit, and the phone number is issued 
    to Mystery-Telco.
4.] Say something to the effect of `I called here yesterday...' or 
    `This odd thing keeps appearing...' Then ask them if it has the 
    right address in a pushy-hurry-up way, like `We'll is it my address 
    all right what's the address you have on your screen over there? 
    Nah, that's not _my_ address...' 
5.] Hints & Tips : If it is any normal residential/business number it 
    will appear on Bell Atlantic's screen's right away. If it is not a 
    normal number/exchange, as in the case of the 950 exchange they 
    will not have the number but will instead be prompted for a 
    customer code. CC are like data passwords, three digit codes that 
    appear on the party's telephone bill.


WHAT REALLY HAPPENED BY DARK PHIBER:

[March 10, 1995]

        Well today I was visited by a local Detective and a the 
Corporate Investigator for Bell Atlantic. Seems they have traced 11 
calls (in 9 days, more to come they say) thru a rerouter (using Ultra 
Call Forwarding) back to my house. Seems they also know about me and a 
mortgage company called S.F. Assoc. and how I tried to social engineer 
there dial-up, login, and password out of a secretary. They say for 
every call I forwarded is equal to a felony, since the forwarding is 
done by computer, it is a "computer crime." I have to go down to the 
station next week for more questioning.
        As the investigators were coming into my home, I started to 
"deltree \renegade". Some files were erased. After talking with the 
investigators for about 30 minutes they wanted to see "my setup." So I 
showed them my computer (turned off). They said they could be leaving 
with all my computer equipment right now if they wanted to. So I 
thought it would be best to get rid of everything that had to do with 
hacking or phreaking on my computer, just in case they did come back 
for it.

[March 11-12, 1995]

        Since I knew my board would be missed I came up with the idea 
of the "virus" (since I was told not to divulge any information about 
the case). So there was no virus, I just deleted everything I had. I 
thought about setting up my board once again but thought that it would 
never be the same again. Nor would I ever be the same fone phreak I 
was, due to an extreme case of paranoia. I figured I would hint at the 
fact that I would no longer be in "the scene" as well. I figured I 
wouldn't make that statement until I could release this file and let 
everyone know what was going on (after my case was over). Luckily I am 
still a minor so I will probably just have to pay for the phone calls 
(lucky me, I turn 18 April 20, a month later and I would be in jail 
right now).

[March 22, 1995]

        Today my mom finally received a call that I am to report to 
the station on Friday, March the 24th at 4:00pm to make a statement. 
It will have been two weeks since my first contact with the 
investigators when I meet with them this Friday.

[March 24, 1995]

        After an hour of interrogation, them asking me the same 
questions in more detail that they did when they came to my house, I 
was told that I would _probably_ only be charged with a misdemeanor 
"Theft of Service" and would have to appear in juvenile court. I will 
also have to pay $124 for the phone bill to my unsuspecting victim. 
This was told to me by the detective that is involved in my case and 
said he still has to talk to the District Attorney before anything 
final is decided.

Mrs. Karen (Last Name)
Street Address
Fairless Hills, P. 19030

Dear Mrs. (Last Name),

        Thank you for meeting with me and Detective Belinski on 
Friday, March 24, 1995 to discuss John's involvement in the matter 
under investigation.

        As I promised, this letter will serve as a notice of the 
amount for restitution to be paid to clear the bill of the person 
whose line John used for Ultra Call Forwarding. As we discussed, the 
service (Ultra Call Forwarding) was activated 154 times to 40 
different numbers between February 16, 1995 and March 10, 1995. This 
resulted in Mr. Guth's line being billed an extra $124.55 in usage he 
did not do.

        Therefore, the amount needed from John is $124.55 to clear up 
the account. As Detective Belinski mentioned, it would be a good idea 
to have the restitution paid prior to court as this will look good to 
a Judge. Please make your check out to Bell Atlantic - PA, c/o Charles 
Snyder, One Parkway, Floor 3-B, Philadelphia, PA. 19102, and note Case 
3488 on the check.

        Again, thank you for your cooperation this matter. If you 
have any questions, please call me at 1-800-222-4259.

Thank you,

Charles Snyder (signed)

HOW TO SET UP MCI RE-ROUTERS BY KAOS:

Hello out there in H/P world. Now I know all you folks out there have 
always wanted re-routers for multipurposes including making safe, 
effective calls with little risk of getting caught. The easiest way to 
accomplish this is to set up an MCI re-router. This is very simple and 
here is a step by step procedure that will help you with this. 
*Remember* Never re-route to your home phone or any of your relatives 
either. This reduces the risk of getting caught greatly. If you *DO* 
still want to reroute to your home, that's up to you but it is most 
likely you will be caught for doing such a thing. Ok. On to the 
procedure...

1) Dial "0" (Note: In most area codes, this will kill ANI and the call 
   will be unable to be traced to where ever you are calling from.)
2) Tell the operator to connect you with 1-800-444-3333 (MCI customer 
   service).
3) You will then be asked to choose the option(s) that serve you best 
   by pressing some touch tone keys. I'm sure you can figure out that 
   all that you are doing here is attempting to speak with MCI 
   customer service. 
4) A customer service representative (CSR) will then come on and ask 
   if they can help you. 
5) Tell them you would like to switch to MCI. (Look for my article in 
   ABUSE207.ZIP for more info on this.)
6) After you have your account set up, tell him/her that you heard it 
   was possible to set up an 800# that is used to call home with. 
7) The CSR will then say something like, "Yes sir, that feature can be 
   added to your account if necessary." 
8) You would now ask for more options and cost to keep her busy. Now 
   tell her that you heard it was possible to re-route that number if 
   you go on vacation or are away from home. She will then explain the 
   options to you and you just keep talking.
9) Ok, now get your pen ready because she is going to give you your 
   personal 800# and 4 digit access code. She will also give you an 
   800# to call for re-routing. You will have another pin for this 
   number.
10) You're all done now. Remember to be polite and act like you're 
    listening to her. 
11) Now wait about 7-10 days and test out the re-router. If everything 
    goes ok, this will work. The re-router will last about a month or 
    so but if it goes down, just set up another one! 
12) One last thing, if you are totally clueless and cannot figure this 
    out yourself, its probably because you didn't read my article in 
    abuse207.zip

BELL ATLANTIC'S VMB SERVICE BY MORPHEUS:

So you want to set yourself up with a mess of VMBs...

1.] What you need to do first is get your telephone book out and flip 
    thru until you come across a big color ad for a big but obscure 
    corporation. Hospitals also work. You'll need the address and the 
    main office phone number. Write them down. You will also need a 
    non-post office box drop off site. This is a good thing to have 
    anyway so go ahead and seek one out. Look for neighbors who'll be 
    on vacation for over a week at least. And as usual you'll need to 
    set up a false identity, the works, and also don't forget to _be 
    creative_ ! Make up a different scenario every time! Have your 
    story and facts straight before calling.
2.] Now go ahead and call Bell Atlantic's Business services dept., 
    it's in your phone book. Ask about setting up a VMB system for the 
    business you just picked out. Go along with all the stuff the 
    operator says and answer the questions they'll ask. Nothing 
    personal, since you're representing a corporation.
3.] When you play your cards right, the phone number you gave them 
    will provide them with the address of the corporation. Remember: 
    you are the big guy in charge of things, and the bill for the VMB 
    System should be sent to the corporation, while the VMB lists will 
    be sent to the external billing office/drop site marked ATTN: MR 
    FAKE NAME, director of services, or something, so you get the VMB# 
    list while the bills are sent to a big corporation that probably 
    doesn't know what it's left hand is doing so it will probably be 
    paid for.
4.] Okay, bigshot, so everything is set. Give them a # that will 
    always be busy for them to contact you at. If there are no 
    abnormalities, they will not even call that number.
5.] Hints & Tips: This is for VMBs that will be accessible through one 
    automated attendant. Essentially, you will be requesting:
        
                - 20+ Voice MailBoxes.
                - an 800# to access them through.
                - An Automated Attendant.
                - 30+ minutes recording time per box.
                - External Access <away from internal switches>

    If you don't clearly request these things, Bell Atlantic will give 
    you their default setting which assumes you have an extra 
    receptionist and a main telephone line. <you don't>
6.] Finally, if everything is completed correctly the list of VMB#, the 
    800#, and a heap of information in the mail at your drop site in 
    approx. five business days.
7.] Wondering how much your bill is costing someone else? Here's a 
    rough list of the prices as explained by Bell Atlantic.

                - Setup for the 800# line       -      $75.00
                - 800# service to that line     -      $20.00 month
                - 800# caller time              -      $0.21 - 0.23 a 
                                                       minute
                - VMB cost per box              -      $20.00 setup 
                                                       <waved>
                - VMB cost per month per box    -      $10.00 - 15.00
