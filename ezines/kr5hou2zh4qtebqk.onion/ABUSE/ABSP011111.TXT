um, i had a dream about a week ago.. and uhh, we (i'm not sure who else it 
was) killed some guy (i'm not sure who he was).  not stopping there, we
proceeded to remove his heart, then castrate the guy..  am, anyone care to
interpret that?  kinda scary.

I thought it would be kewl to take some of the things we have seen around 
about us and let everyone see it. There's nothing really informative in here
as far as H/P is concerned, but some of this stuff is pretty damn funny.

        Well we have found out on some BBS's and some people that CAFBL is not
really liked. So I thought I would bring together some of the messages that I
have recieved telling us how much we suck.

Yeah, but these zines actually are rather a problem to the scene fairly often.
You have inexperienced newbiews producing magazines with phreaking tips such
as "l00KiNG 0V3R p3EpLEZ sH00lD3Rz f0R /<0d3Z iZ /<r4D". A small number of
zines would actually be beneficial to the scene & more people should revert to
the DIY method of exploring & gaining info.

    The only good mags in my opinion are COTNO and Phate, I suppose there are
some virus related ones, but I've never been to interested.
    The best source of information (for phreaking) is telco systems, manuals,
and employees.  You can also get a tonne out of simply reading telecom digest,
and the countless USENET and FidoNet telecom related groups.
    And yeah, if more people concentrated on writing their own files, on new
subjects, it'd be alot more interesting.  I've got so many rough notes, I just
need some time to piece them together into a respectable looking file :)

i personally think Abuse E-mag is a seriously lame piece of shit... but they
could also get better.
me and music phreak each have a tfile that will be released under the AMITECH
name reasonably soon.  Mine is a PRIMOS hacking guide,  and MP wrote up some
shit on EmpireNet.

  True the article on the cna's in the abuser is very offensive to phreakers
in general.. Kaos I believe that may have lost much respect for the mag..
They are not presenting the info in a proper way by which for people to learn

to make my point known to all.. i say CAFBL sucks because anyone who thinks 
they are cool for just going off and performing "underground-ish" tasks such 
as hacking and shit needs to come out from in front of their computer a little
more.. thanks for the insult.. means a lot to me from someone who hides behind
a handle.. that (i know i've said this before somewhere else) is why i don't 
expect you people to fear me.. because all we know about each other is one or 
two words by which we identify ourselves with over a phone line..

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

[Thunderstorm]
What groups are you into now?

im not into any groups or anything, but i do some programming on my own
time... starting a board focused only on Music files, such as Midi, Mod, and 
S3M, NO Warez, and stuff....

What are ya? [ansi d00d, hacker, phreak, warez d00d]

nothing...i am myself...

Do you phear CAFBL?

some of the stuff seems extreme than again, most of the people deserve it...

Have you seen CAFBL around? 

on a few boards...not really too many...

What do you think of CAFBL now?

seems okay...seems to have made a name for itself...


[Grifter]
What groups are you into now?

I program for a shareware group, Creative Software.  I'm in no h/p or demo
groups at the moment, but I do still write loaders and demos. 

What are ya? [ansi d00d, hacker, phreak, warez d00d]
I'm not an ansi d00d, but I do consider myself a hacker, and somewhat a 
phreak, plus, I'm a kick ass coder.

Do you phear CAFBL?
No, I don't phear you, but I do respect you.

Have you seen CAFBL around? 
I've seen you around, and think you have improved greatly since your first
release.

What do you consider yourself in the scene? 

Well mostly a phreak. Really I can't hack for shit. I don't know UNIX very 
well. I know enough about fones and the fone system to get me by. It's 
probably something I wouldn't mind getting a job doing and probably will.


How'd you get started in the scene?

I don't know where I got the idea of hackers. But when I was at the library
one day I did a search for it on the computer and found the book The Hacker
Crackdon by Bruce Sterling and that got me interested. The only thing I had to 
communicate with at the time was a 2400 baud modem and a Prodigy account. So 
that's where I started. I know that sounds lame, but everyone has to start 
somewhere. I meet Optic on Prodigy and he helped me along and got me started. 
Then I meet Dash on Prodigy too and he asked me if I wanted to be a co-sysop 
of a BBS (which I never even heard of at the time). I said sure and learned 
renegade really fast. Optic would talk about AMiTECH and since I couldn't get
into AMiTECH I started my own group, CAFBL.

                                    both pretty lame (although he was still
                                    more experienced than me then) and he
                                    told me about the puter underground and 
                                    let me hang out with all the more 
                                    experienced hackers and such... 

What or who do you hate about the scene? Actually, i kinda hate the term
                                         "scene"... makes me think of warez.. 
                                         but ummm i'm not too fond of those 
                                         warez boards who think can write
                                         "H/P/A/T/V/C/W/S/K ELiTE FiLeZ!@#$%" 
                                         just 'cause they have one file on 
                                         hacking prodigy.

     Godd(+d)!@!@!#!@#!!1  This is your life.


     We ran into Godd when he first called my board Mogel-Land and he decided
to e-mail me a ba-zillion times asking to be a HoE site.  Before I had even
looked at his mail I was getting yelled at to look at his application.  I
don't like being called a cocksucker.  I do like being called a fat italian
cocksucker.  Since he didn't call me what I wanted to be called I deleted him
from Mogel-Land.  That is the beginning of the Godd myth0s.

     I later ran into Godd posting on a lousy local board in 215 called "The
Pit".  Yes, that's the same board the produced such glorious fighters of
intelligence like the Modem Mafia.  I guess some boards, no matter how
shitty, you just have to call for a good laugh.  At any rate, I saw one of
the st00pitest BBS ads I had ever seen in my life, posted by Godd.  It was
one of those type of posts that make you slap yourself in the face and say
"HOLY SHIT! THERE REALLY ARE FUCKUPS LIKE THIS OUT THERE! IS IT ALL WORTH IT?
SHOULD I KILL MYSELF?!" so like, I replied and had a little short-lived
argument.  I later realized just how funny it was, and decided to print the
captures in HoE #60.  I had sealed Godd's fate.

     I frequented The Hacker Crackdown, run by Dark Phiber (former CAFBL HQ)
bunches and the CAFBL boys read the HoE.  They decided to talk to the
whippersnapper.  Dark Phiber called the board (named "Satan's Sanctuary") and
basically wanted to know why Godd had used the name "DpE" for a group he was
in, when the name DpE was being used for some other group.  Soon after DP
called, I called the board.  

    What I saw in the board scared me.  I was stepping deep into the heart of
moronism.  That was when I not only decided to invent an entire new science
based on the study of morons, but I realized that Godd had to be stopped.
Fortunately, for my realms of maturity, I only did what I did best - make him
feel stupid.  So, me and Black Francis declared (with everyone's agreement)
that Godd would be the OFFICIAL 215 Mascot.  The actual real trouble for Godd
came, however, from the CAFBL boys.

    It was really sparked when Kaos and Godd chatted and Godd decided he
would take it as his opportunity (which he later did a bunch of other times)
to declare the "lameness" of the group CAFBL and other such "insults". He
also had created his own group called "Text Forecasters" (or 'TF' for those
that are h1p) which was supposedly a poetry and H/P group.  Shrug.  I didn't
really pay much attention at first.

The CAFBL guys, I guess, don't take insults well.  Dark Phiber, with the help
of Kaos, succeeded in doing all sorts of things hence forth.  DP found out
Godd's inph0 and made it public.  Basically this led to Godd getting a heck
of a lot of crank calls to his home.  His Mother and Father had no idea that
Godd was running a BBS off his 'private line', which meant eventual curtains
for his BBS.  Kaos and Morpheus ringled a lot fun and CAFBL had eventually
entertained itself quite a bit.  It was epitomized when DP put Ultra Call
Forwarding on your BBS line and forwarded it to the Secret Service.

     A few days before Godd's board died I called once more, whereon, I
chatted with Godd for a while.  All the while I honestly had no clue what he
was talking about.  At any rate, he told me to download the first TF2_95.ZIP
release and so I did.  Straight off of his board.  I read the release.

     Again, the world around me shook.  I could not conceive of this.  This
was again a level of pathetic I had never experienced before.  Here I was
was, looking at stupid incarnate.  The release had a "newsletter" file that
opened with quotes from Kurdt K0brain and Sn0pp d0GGy d0g.  It broke into a
top-10 list of reasons why you shouldn't call a "PD" board, none of which
were funny or understandable really.  It included a Mod of the "TF" theme
song, which was a bad rendition of "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.  It had
plans for a gNu .box, called the Lock Box, which was a Box based on a * Bell
Service and wasn't a "box" at all.  Uhm, yeah.  Ultimately, it was a big
laugh.  DP put it best when he said "You say seriously, what HoE says
Sarcastically."

     After people laughed for days about the TF file, Godd posted publicly
on The Pit that TF was NOT his group (he said he had nothing to do with it),
and in fact it was some other local guy named "Problemed" which it was known
that CAFBL didn't like either.  I guess in his own little warped mind he
thought he was being slick.  He had forgotten that he had CHATTED with me and
told me to get the TF release.  I replied to his message telling him that I
couldn't believe that he was denying that he was the sole maker and producer
of TF.  Of course he was.  He replied something to the effect of "I can't
explain it to you, it's just too k0mplex.  These things don't seem to make
sense probably because I have nothing to do with them."  Uhhh... yeah.  So I
sarcastically asked him if perhaps someone had broken into his house and
started chatting with me about TF.  He didn't reply to that.  He just denied
being in TF.  (Note: Godd's name was all over the file, and the "style" of
typing in the file was an EXACT match to the confusing retarded style that
Godd used in any chat or post I had ever seen.  It couldn't have been
'Problemed', because after one one encounter with him, I knew that he was not
mentally capable of producing such a good imitation.  He just wasn't smart
enough.)

     "FINE," I said, "if no one actually runs TF how is 215 going to get it's
qu4l1ty Ayche-Pee?!@!@#" 

     It was decided on a k0nf (being billed to Godd) that we would repay his
hospitality by producing our own next release of TF.  We would fill it with
the stupidest possible t-files we could write, and thus we did.  TF3_5.ZIP
was made and it was a swell little rap up to the Godd epidemic.  He had
become famous, thanks to us, in 215 for being infamous m0r0n.  People called
Godd Long Distance to talk to him.  Some people gave his # out on IRC.

     That was basically that.  Godd is still around.  Currently him,
Problemed, Sub Zero, and other 'elite' rej3cts of 215 hang out together in
some dark, twisted, and (of course) pathetic place in some board Somewhere.
None of us much really care anymore about it.  As it stands today, Godd and
Sub Zero think CAFBL is the epitome of H/P 'coolness' and are planning to
submit to it.  Godd goes to the same High School as Kaos and follows him
everywhere worshipping him as GaWd.  I think it's cute in a sort of way.
Godd and all those guys got their own little club to be friends, CAFBL was
amused, Black Frannie got to make fun of someone to no ends, and I had made
all this documented.  We all won out.

     One may wonder why did we spend so much time playing with Godd.  That
question can only be answered by each individual.  We all sort of knew deep
down, however, that there was hundreds of Godd's out there.  After HoE #60
was released, I heard again and again from people "We have a guy like that in
our area code too!"  I guess it was a symbol of ultimate proof.  We did what
GwD did in 806 with Greeny.  We made a confirmed l0zer.

     Because I'm a self-analytical Fuckup, I often ask myself if what was
done to Godd was mature or not.  I was convinced many different ways on it for
a while, and I ultimately decided "Fuck it."  There are just some people out
there that will always have these things coming to them.  You can't control
it.  Have fun.  I, myself, although I never did any "abuse", did condone it.
Not to mention the fact that I started all this trouble originally for Godd.
I guess my only answer is sometimes we need to kick, point, and laugh at the
stupid.  It's the only way anything will ever change.  The 'Godd's out there
are multiplying by the day.  

     Godd, I know that you will read this file.  You are reading it right now
and your brain is probably churning in ways it never has before.  When I
heard you talking that first time on the Teleconfrence I wanted to say it to
you then, but I knew that in text form it would mean much more.  You don't
get it.  Even after it's been thrown in your face you don't get it.
Maturity, being real, and style are what it's about.  Let this be the most
important lesson about 'the scene' that you ever learn from a t-file.

    "He thought the local 2600 meetings were called H.O.P.Es." - Sub Zero
    
    "That CAN'T be godd.  That was an complete thought." - Spiff
    
    "We don't want any losers on this teleconfrence!" - Godd

[Note: Kaos was supposed to write the 'retro' file.  He was too slow.  Did I
do a good job?  Think so?  Good.]

     Here are many quotes that I have compiled from the mythical moron.
These were nabbed from posts, chats, and private e-mails.  I think it makes
an interesting case study.  Note that all the quotes are in chronological
order.

"...its bright and h/p/a/c/v activises in 2i5 are on the move ... listen to
metallica they rule.... we also predict a big downfall for Cafbl..."

"You can't change anything on anyone's phone account without a password."

"mogel...hahahah that pussy, i logged on to his bbs, i never begged shit!, i

i hoped 1! of them who answer, now that aint begging, begging is stooopid, i
dont like hoe, at all really, their the next potential high flyer from
2i5!..."

"...this fucking area code is full of Power Trippy lil lamerz like KAOS,
mOGEL AND black francis mostly, though i apologize to the cool people who
dont go off and try to be /<-rad, anyway, whom have no skill and knocj the
skillz of other poeple, and in generally, cornily bullied their way into an
area in which they are about to have to deicide what to do, and make mistakes
they will, and i iwll be their to reap the joyous collection of InSultS and
the happy downfall of hoe and high flyers a like, and you so judgmental,
cursing the Tf's and the DpE's and the small cool groups of today with your
high flyers Sooooooooper doooooooper ansi rips and your awesome /<radicality
should shove it up your ass...."

"phiber, look if you dont shut the fuck up with your Promo Soooper Fucking
you better than everyone attitude i am gonna have to fucking delete ya

blow it out your ass! dont gimme yer shit cause i am tired of going and
deleting you corny fucking posts..."

"i am the fucking Tf founder! its beemn in the works. its a small lil LiT and
other h/p/c/a/v lil shits group that ya know dont doooo a whole lot of
sooooooooper ansi's and shit but just writes some stuff they think is cool"

"well i donno what k rad means but i 've always know it to be used
negativly..."

"hoe ... well what about em... i havent read something from you guyz in
ages ... my dicsion as of the last one i read is you guys rule.... but ....
ya never know till you;ve sampled the best and the worst...."

"pbiber, hey this is the eternal d! whats up man? i like you TF thing but
check out the message bases... i pretty much denoted any connected to Tf
being as it was all problemed doing... anywayz... i just wanted to say
yello, and uhh ... well maybe next weekend you can check out my telecon i
will have up....i will email the details anyway but .... thanks man sorry
about rippings yaz that time it was outta line cuz you had already explained
you had no prob with me...."

"DEAR PEOPLE!
This is Godd DA DA! DA DA .....
i wonna make the announcement that the text forcastors thing
released under the name TF2-95.zip IS NOT mine....
nor will any other files under that name be mine.....
i never write any actual files for it..... i only mentioned 
that as a name for group to a few people a month or so back....
i belived it was PROBLEMED, being as he started my past 
problems... Futhermore i wonna Apologize for what i said about 
CAFBL that long time ago to DP, becuase he had made it clear 
he had no problem with me previous to the writing of my hate 
mail...... now.... i wonna thank for you time.... and i guess thats it...."

"but you can docotr anything you want i was never in TF!... as for grave
digger like i said he jumps on the band wagon of whatever is up for now....
which is better than what i do, at least as far you you go, i might act like
a moron but i do my best ot clean up any mess' i make.... i never pick
anyone for a serious attack, usually, though i aint as lame as some might
think... perhaps my lash out on you has made you non-understanding of the
situation... i have no problem with anyone in the area code... lest you
consider my past... but all in all i have seriously cleaned up what i have
done and made all around good relations..... so as far as what most want to
think about my story (the truth) or this whole situation i dont really
care.... i mean i know this may seen blurred and not very informative but...
thats what its supposed to do isnt it.... each action that seems to come
next from me a lil more and more unpredicable.... probably DO OT the fact
that i aint doing em... why would i starte a war with CAFBL... and mogel i
have never said anything but sorry's and thank you's to you!... as long as i
see no reason to fight..."
