        Sorry for the long delay. Our major set back this month was due to me
deleting the only copy of The Abuser issue 6 I had. Thank god Rush 2 had a
copy of it printed out. So I would like to thank Rush 2 for taking the time to

UNDERGROUND NEWS: 

Boy Caught Beige Boxing

        January 12, 12:04 am A 15 year-old Bethlehem boy was caught outside a 
business in the 600 block of Lehigh St. in Bethlehem, PA last night.  He was 
charged allegedly with prowling and attempting to make a phone call from 
outside a local business.

Information Is Illegally Traveled On The Information Super Highway 

        NEW YORK, (AP) - The infobahn turned into the info-gone on Christmas
day when sophisticated computer hackers used the Internet to break in and take 
over the computer of a well known computer security expert, The New York 
Times reported. 
        A federal computer security agency today was to outline the
ways to prevent the intrusions the Times said. Computer experts are warning 
that the intruders could copy or destroy the documents or even work undetected
by masquerading as an authorized user.
        Tsutomu Shimomura (sic) a well-known computer security specialist
at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, said the culprit took over his 
computer on December 25, controlling it for more than a day and electronically
stealing a large number of computer security programs.
        Several attacks have been reported since then, but the exact number 
is unknown. About 20 million people use the global Internet.
        "Essentially everyone is vulnerable" said James Settle, a former
FBL computer crime expert who is now an executive at the Inet Corp., a 
computer security firm.
        Officials of the government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT), said the new assaults are a warning that better security precautions
must be taken before business dive into the Internet.
        The response team at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh plans
to post an advisory today(1/23/95) on the Internet, alerting users to the 
attacks and urging them to use security programs, the Times said.

        The intruders fool computers into believing that a message is coming
from a trusted source. By posing as a familiar computer, an attacker can
get access to protected computer resources and seize control of what was
considered a well guarded system. 
        Classified government computer systems are not thought to be at risk
because they are not directly connected to the Internet, the newspaper said.

        The Internet was originally created by academic researchers to 
share computer data easily. 
        The Times said the security warning to be issued today will include a 
list of brands of computers that can use a program to guard against the
hacking method known as "Internet Protocol Spiffing".
                          

HOW TO BLOW UP A CAR BY THE CROWE:

     How to blow up a car.  First you need to go out and get some Draino,
Comet, those little soap pellets,(you know the kind where you put them in the
bathtub and the outer parts melts off, leaving the soap.)  and last a syringe. 
Once you have all of these things in your possession then you are ready to 
begin.  Mix the Draino and the Comet in a container use just a little bit more
Draino than Comet.  After you do this and they are mixed together pretty good,
get one of those lovely soap balls (hopefully you got the biggest ones that 
they had) and the syringe.  Stick the syringe in one of the soap balls and
extract all of the soap that is in there.  It might be a good idea to heat up
the syringe so that it goes in easier.  Now extract some of your Draino and 
Comet mixture and fill the soap ball with it.

      All you have to do is put a couple of these babies in someone's gas tank 
and when they get their motor started and everything gets heated up...
POW!  KABLAAM!  BOOM!  The outer part of the soap balls will melt leaving 
your mixture of Draino and Comet which will eat through the gaslines, almost
always causing the whole car to blow sky high!

HOW TO GET DELPHI FOR FREE BY RUSH 2:

        The first thing that you must remember is that it is easy and fairly
safe.  To start get a copy of a magazine, a computer magazine.  Now go to the
back of the magazine to the advertiser's index.  Look up Delphi international
or something like that.  Ok, once you find it and turn it to the pay it will
give the regular boring info about it.  The stuff for the lamers.  Now it gives
you a number to call voice, 1-800-365-4636.  Call that with your modem.  Or 
if you already have a tymnet dial-up number (or sprintnet) you can call that
and connect delphi.  As your user name use joindelphi.

        Now if you are calling your tymnet number or the given inwats number
(1-800 for you lamers), the tymnet way is preferable because you are less 
likely to be traced (which probably wont happen anyway.  Now use the password
that it gives your which will be something like pcc99a, it depends on which
magazine you used.  Now use a credit card number generator like Cmaster2,  It
does not matter as long as it works.  REMEMBER this rule, never use the same
number twice because 1.it wont let you, and 2 you will in-danger your life
as a free man.

        Now that you have signed up and selected a tymnet or sprintnet 
dial-up you will have to call their 800# customer support line to verify
this information.  Remember when you sign up to use a GOOD, easily accessible
dump site to keep the account longer.  Enjoy it and abuse it. have fun.  


HOW TO MAKE BOMBS BY SPOOKY:              

              Ok this is my first article for this kick ass group and
since this is also the first anarchy(note: this word is not being used
correctly and I will only use it till I can find a good substitute for
it but I digress) article in here(as far I know) I figured I'd start
my (hopefully long) career as a writer for CAFBL with a article on
some quick and easy bombs that you may/may not have heard of before.
If you don't like this I'm sorry but tough shit.  When you get into a
group you can write about anything you want to.  Well here we go!

 Hydrogen Bomb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              There aren't many people who do not know how to make one
of these but I thought I'd cover it anyway. This is a very easy bomb
to make. All you need is Liquid Draino or muric acid, aluminium foil,
and an airtight container(I use a 2 liter soda bottle). What you do is
put the Liquid Draino or muric acid into the soda bottle(or whatever
you're using) and then add aluminium foil balls. This mixture will
react to make hydrogen. Now there are lots of things you can do with
this. The simplest would be to cap it tightly and the hydrogen will
build up pressure and burst the container. But that's no fun since
there is no fire produced. A better thing to do is put a balloon on the
container, let it fill with hydrogen, put a fuse in there, tie it,
light the fuse and let go...Wallah you have a miniature Hindenburg<sp?>
Or you could just drill a hole in the cap(assuming you are using a 2
liter bottle), stick a fuse in, and lastly seal it with clay so no
precious gas escapes.

Co2 Cartridge Bomb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              These are pretty well known but I figure what the hell.
All you need is black powder, fusing, and either clay or wax(clay is
definitely safer to use unless you don't mind losing fingers.) What
you do is saw off the small neck of the cartridge and fill it with
black powder. Next put in a fuse and light. You could also wrap it in
wire for shrapnel, or tape and thick paper for a loud bang. A
variation on this is to not plug it so it will be like a rather quick
and dangerous bottle rocket.

Napalm
^^^^^^^^
              You almost have to have been living in a cave not to
have heard of how to make this stuff but in case you were I'm gonna
cover it anyway. What you need is lots of Styrofoam and some gasoline,
lighter fluid(optional- I find that it makes it easier to light after
it has lain around for awhile), a container(I use old coffee cans). To
make it fist take the Styrofoam and rip it into little pieces and put
it in the coffee can(or whatever you are using as a container) and
pour the gas on it, careful not to pour too much(I use about a little
less than a 1/3 of a cup per coffee can full of Styrofoam) If you do
add too much gas don't worry. You can just add more Styrofoam till the
desired consistency is reached. I usually put it outside for a night
so it jells then I add a few drops of lighter fluid and stir so it
lights a little better.
              You can use this stuff to write on wood, as a very cruel
practical joke, help start a fire that just doesn't seem to want to
stay alive, and start just about anything on fire. Use your
imagination. I will have a project in which you will use this in an
upcoming issue so look out for it!

Exploding flints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              These aren't really bombs but they are kinda neat,
cheap, and need no preparation. First get some flints.(you can get 10
of them for like 50 cents at Rite-Aid or wherever). What you do is
hold the flints(not in your HAND stupid..use a pair of tweezers or
something) and heat it till it looks wrinkled and then turns red. Then
throw it against something and it will burst into a shower of sparks.
They are neat and you can scare the shit outta someone real good if
you pretend like you are just throwing a rock or something. You can
also use these as ignition devices if you are a good aim. Or you could
put black powder on the ground and throw one of these on it and REALLY
scare the shit outta something. Also if you have a real stupid friend
you could show him/her the trick them sell him/her flints for a really
outrageous price and tell them that they are getting a real good deal
or something. You get the idea.

Lightbulb Bomb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              These are very nasty and I would no recommend you
building them. The only reason I'm telling you is because I feel that
I must spread any knowledge I have and if you do something bad with it
then it's your choice. You will need lightbulbs, gas, and a needle.
Take the needle and fill it with gas. then stick the needle inside of
the bulb by going in between the metal part and the glass. You may
have to open it up a little with a knife. Put gas in there till you
feel you put enough in there. Now put it in a lamp. When the lamp is
turned on the red hot filament inside the bulb will ignite the gas
which will burst the bulb, spreading flames everywhere.

Smoke Bombs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              Ahh the always fun smoke bomb. You only need two
chemicals for this: saltpeter and sulphur. What you do is mix the two
at a 2|1 ratio (saltpeter|sulphur). Next heat the mixture on the stove
under low heat(you don't want a whole batch of this stuff going off
inside of your house, trust me) until it melts. Then you can pour it
into a mold or cast or a paper cup. Stick a fuse in it and it's ready
to go! There are many uses for this kind of smoke bomb. for instance
you can put one in the school ventilation system(that should get you
outta class  for awhile and the smoke has some....uhhh..rather
startling effects on the human male's body if you know what i mean),
put one in the bathroom or a mall or something and shout "Fire!!", you
can shove some of this stuff up a cars muffler and the heat from the
car will ignite the combination, spewing smoke out an making people
wonder how that car passed emissions.  Watch soon for another article
by me on a project you can make with this stuff.

Flame Thrower
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              This uses the relatively old concept of a can of
hairspray and candle. but the difference is you don't have to hold the
candle so you don't have to get burnt anymore. All you need to do is
take some stiff wire and bend it like this:

            ___________________________
            ณ----------          ------\     Sorry bout the pic
                      ณ          /------     I suck at ASCII drawings
                  ____ณ              __ณ

                      (side view)


          ___________
         /           \                ______
       /              \              /      \
       ณ     __________ณ-------------    ___/
        \             /               \____/
          \__________/

                   (overhead view)

              Eek again sorry bout the pic bit it's hard to explain.
It's basically on loop around the hairspray can then it comes down and
out to the middle of the loop to support the can. The other side is
two loops around the candle and then it comes down and to the middle
of the two loops to support the candle. Sorry if this doesn't make
sense but I'm like half asleep right now.


HOW TO USE YOUR MCI CARD AND NOT GET CAUGHT BY KAOS:

Ok. Your MCI card # is .............. this card will not last long so please
abuse the fuck out of it while you have it. Here's what to do. First dial "0"
and wait for the operator. Tell her that the "2" is broken on your phone. 
Then ask her to please connect you to 1-800-950-1022. She will say ok or 
whatever and you will hear it ringing. When it picks up you will hear a tone 
for about 3 seconds. After the tone, Enter 06105551212 to test it. If you 
don't want to test it and you want to use it right away, just dial 0, the 
area code and number you want to call. After you are done this, You will hear 
another 3 second tone. Now dial in the MCI card number above. You will dial
in ALL 14 DIGITS of the card. Pin included. After this you will hear two 
short tones and it will ring. If this happens then the card is working. If 
you get a short message saying re-enter your card # then it is invalid or you
screwed up entering it the first time. Try it again and if it says please 
hold for the MCI operator than hang up! The card will last for 3 days at the
minimum to 1 year at the max (Only if the card owner is really stupid though)
Now you have a valid MCI card.

EXPLANATION of DIALING "0"

Ok. This is simple. MCI has this thing called an ANI. An ANI is an Automatic
Number Identification. This is very important. If you call from your home 
phone without using "0", MCI will look up your ANI to see if it is a hacked 
account. This is why "0" must be dialed. I have tried this method and it is 
100% untracable.

HOW TO GET FAKE ID'S BY DOG'N'DIRT:

        The corner stone of all identity is the birth certificate.  It is the 
     most widely accepted form of ID in the US.  Birth certificates are as 
     varied as the people who posses them.  They have no photographs, 
     and rarely finger or footprints.  The only really consistent aspect 
     is that they are invariably signed by a doctor or hospital administrator. 

        Two Ways Of Getting One
     There are two ways commonly used to get a birth certificate under another 
     name.  One is the counterfeit-forgery method, the other is the 
     infant-death method.

1.1      Counterfeit-Forgery Method  (short-term)
             The counterfeit-forgery method can be used to obtain all valid info 
     except for a passport.  This method is simple, effective, and takes 
     little time.  
             Forging a birth certificate involves taking a valid document and 
     altering the info within its four corners.  One easy and effective 
     method for obtaining blank birth certificates is to purchase them 
     as  hospitals often do, from a document supply company.  This can 
     either be done by telephone or in person, but you must establish 
     yourself as a legit purchaser, as every supplier has a different 
     sales policy.  For example if I were to call a supplier, I might 
     identify myself as the administrator of Acme Hospital looking for 
     a new supplier of forms.  I could then request a copy of their 
     catalogues of birth certificates, or certificates of live birth.  
            Once received orders can be placed directly.  
            An alternate and much preferred method of obtaining blank birth 
     certificate blanks is to alter the existing birth certificate.  This 
     includes getting a printer to reproduce a real birth certificate, 
     excluding and of the type-written birth data on it.  In other words a 
     printer creates a blank birth certificate from an actual legal original.  Most printers in a larger city will do this without thinking twice.  However in some circumstances a printer would hesitate in taking on this job even if you were paying in cash
     When they remove the data on the birth certificate, you can tell them to 
     leave the doctors signature if you want, or have it remove and fill it 
     in later. It is also very important to age your birth certificate.  You 
     can do this by creasing it, and leaving it in the sun.  Of you could soak 
     it in tea until an old appearance is obtained.
            Certifying it yourself is simple.  It involves a stamp, 
     an embossing, or both.  Most printers who make stamps and round embossers will make 
     what you need.  Have a printer make an official looking certified stamp, 
     with a blank line below the word "certified" so that a signature, 
     allegedly a clerk, can be filled in.

3.0     The Infant Death Method (long term)
            The infant death method involves taking on the identity of someone 
     who actually lived and died.  By taking on the identity of someone who 
     died young, no records, other than birth and death certificates exist.  
     Second, a passport can be obtained, because when the certificate is 
     checked out it reveals an actual existing person, and there is a record 
     of the birth certificate in the appropriate local agency office. Third 
     it is the most complete long term method of obtaining a fake ID.
     The basic concept is simple.  It involves finding someone who was born 
     at the approximate same time as you, who had the misfortune of dying at 
     a young enough age so that no records exist as far as school, drivers 
     license, credit cards, and the like.  
            First you must find the person you wish to become.  Be honest about how 
     old you are and how old you look.  Then you must go around finding the 
     decedent.  You can do this by actually searching through graveyards, or 
     by going to your local library and reviewing old obituaries, usually 
     found on microfiche or microfilm.
     
        Where They Were Born
            Almost all death certificates show where that person was born.  Anyone 
     can order a death certificate over the phone, from the Bureau of Vital 
     Statistics, Hall of Records or the like.

        Was the Child Born in Another County or State??
            The ideal situation is for the child to be born in one state and 
     die in another.  If this ideal situation is not available, being born 
     in one county and dying in another will work.
            The reason your child must have been born in one area and die in 
     another, is to avoid someone finding out that your taking on that 
     persons identity.  Many counties cross reference their birth and death 
     records.  That is why you must make sure that your county does not cross 
     reference. For example, to apply for a valid US passport it is generally  
     necessary to provide a birth certificate.  If, upon checking out the 
     assumed name,  the clerk finds out that this person is dead, you will be 
     finding federal agents at your door.  However if the person came from a 
     county where cross referencing does not exist then the clerk will find 
     only a valid birth certificate and your passport request will be honored.  
     So you MUST make sure that your 2 counties do not cross reference.  To 
     the best of my knowledge, no states, at the time of writing, cross 
     reference, nor does the federal government.

        Applying for a New Birth Certificate
            You should call the office in question and only then should you 
     fill out an application.  Normally a request form will be involved, so 
     be prepared to substantiate your identity with a business card or some 
     other form of ID, so that your request will be honored without question.
     There are unlimited reasons for requesting, certified copies of birth 
     certificates, and once again, its time to use your imagination.  A 
     family member might be requesting for a out of states family member, or 
     for the local genealogist researching your family tree; an insurance 
     agent may be working on a fraud case; a county health examiner may be 
     researching files, a priest may be doing a favor for an out-of-state 
     parishioner (people never question priests).
            Once you have obtained a birth certificate, getting other forms 
     of ID is comically simple.     

7.3       Getting a Drivers License
            This is possibly the easiest thing to do.  Just take your birth 
     certificate that you made, and take your test.  You might be asked for a 
     social security number, so be prepared.
     If for some reason you cannot get a birth certificate another commonly 
     accepted form of ID is a baptism certificate, all filled in with fancy 
     lettering and an expensive looking folder.  Fortunately for you this can 
     be bought at any religious supply store.  That's how easy it is to get a 
     drivers license.


8.4       Ancillary Documentation
            These are photos, business cards, library cards, return if lost 
     cards, membership cards, social security cards, insurance cards, medical 
     emergency card.
            Say you get stopped by a cop for speeding, and of course he wants 
     to see your drivers license.  No problem, but it may seem very odd that 
     you are carrying nothing else in you wallet. 
            As trivial a these may seem they are the first give away that you 
     aren't who you say you are.

9.6      Social Security Cards
           There will be asked for a lot, why because it is an easy way for 
     individuals and the government to keep up with you.  
             
         To Get One
            There are two major ways to get one. One is to adopt someone 
     else's, the other is to personally, or through a surrogate, apply for a 
     card number under another name.
            If you intend to make up a number you must realize the purpose of 
     the digital sequence used by the Social Security Administration.  The 
     first three digits correspond to the state in which the card was applied 
     for.  And for this reason I am including a chart so you cam make sure 
     the digits in your fake ID match those of the states where you allegedly 
     applied.
            Of much less importance, but still something to consider, is the 
     middle two digits.  They tell the approx. year of issue.  An odd number 
     between 05 and 09 was probably used in the late 1930's, and an even 
     number from 10 on up was probably used after that.  About 15 years ago, 
     previously unused sequences of even numbers between 02 and 08 began to 
     be used.  But the easiest way to get one right is to look on your own 
     birth certificate.
            The final set of four numbers can be utilized with out any worry, 
     because this set is meaningless, determined by the particular sequence 
     at the office you signed up at and is virtually unverifiable.
            If you want a card with the name and number of your choice on it 
     there are firms who, for a small fee, will print a Social Security type 
     card, with your chosen name and number. A company that I have often used 
     is:        
             Dynamic Press
        256 South Robertson Blvd.
        Beverly Hills, CA. 90211 
     This is one of the few trust-worthy companies that puts out a good 
     consistent product.  All you have to do is provide them with a 
     self-addressed envelope and $5.  They very quickly return a very 
     professional looking card to you.
            You can successfully work as an independent contractor, or for a 
     short period of time, an employee of any job with a false Social 
     Security number.  But, working for extended periods of time (about 60 
     days) can lead to minor problems with the FBI.
         
         Applying For a New Social Security Card
            Just go to your local Social Security office and apply for one.  
     If the evidence you give them looks good you will be issued one.  Social 
     Security does not perform background checks to see if the info is valid.

     card by state.

        The United States Citizen Method
            As can be determined by the info sheet put out by the Social 
     Security Administration for applying for an original number, there are 
     different kinds of identifying data that you will need to bring with you 
     when applying.  Category (1) is for US citizens "born in the US".   I 
     think the US citizen category is the easiest to apply for.  
            By using the info in this file, it should be obvious that anyone 
     can prove they are a US citizen even if they are not.
            Most citizens of this country apply for their cards between the 
     ages of fifteen and twenty.  This is about the time most teens are 
     seeking their first jobs and need a card for that purpose.  If you are 
     over eighteen when you apply you must do so in person.  Those under 18 
     can apply through the mail.  A minimum of two identifying documents are 
     needed.
            Always realize that the clerk will be asking why you want one if 
     you are considerably over the age of twenty.
            Age is important only when applying.  After that, you have a card 
     and a number and no further age reference is made, not on the card, or 
     with the Social Security Administration.   There are no check-ups to 
     worry about.  In other words if you are actually thirty-five and your 
     application lists you as twenty, no private party will have access to 
     that file, nor will the Social Security Administration have reason to 
     believe that you are not the age listed on your application.
            If you are under eighteen then take up their offer, and apply 
     through mail. You must prepare an "A" document and a "B" document.  The 
     "A" document is your birth certificate, the "B" document is something 
     such as, school report cards, school ID cards, hospital or doctors 
     records, Boy or Girl Scout ID, stuff like that.  Again, go to your local 
     printer and have these documents altered.  Then write a letter on a 
     piece of notebook paper telling them that your parents are making you 
     get a part time job, and the employer wants a Social Security card, 
     since you do not the job is somewhat in jeopardy.
            An alternate method that usually works is the surrogate method.  
     Just hire a teenager to go do it for you and you avoid the delay of the 
     mail, since there are no photos on the card, there is nothing to worry 
     about. 
        
        The Alien Method
            To obtain a Social Security card as an alien, all you need is a 
     green card.  These are easier for your printer to reproduce than your 
     birth certificate.
            When you apply for a Social Security card, remember the worst 
     that can happen is that you get turned down. 


22.9     Mail Drops
            The mail drop or PO Box can make it difficult if not impossible 
      for people to find out where you really live or work.  There are 
      countless reasons for a mail drop.  My favorite is you can order stuff 
      to it with a fake CC# and have it delivered to your mail drop, where 
      you can either pick it up, or have it forwarded to your real address.  
      

        Establishing a Mail Drop
            The first step in successfully establishing a mail drop is to 
      pick the most prestigious part of town.  This is particularly important 
      if you are applying for a credit card.
            Most mail drops have a forwarding service so that it will be 
      repackaged, restamped and sent to either your house or to another 
      forwarding mail drop, thus making it virtually untraceable, because of 
      the time and money that would have to be spent to do so.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN SCHOOL BY DASH:

To make a long story short, a few months ago some kids at my school
brutally beat another kid in a rival neighborhood. For any of you
that saw the Oprah show on the negatives of 911 a few weeks ago, then
their main topic of discussion was this incident, and Saturday Night
Live also did a skit about the incident. My school has taken alot of
heat for the actions of these few kids, who most likely will be 
spending the rest of their lives in jail. Abington High School 
literally looked like a zoo with all the reporters from New York and
Hard Copy and everyone else. 
        After this incident, maybe one of the weirdest girls in our
school, along with a few of her friends, published an underground
newspaper called Freaks Anonymous. And of course, the very first 
article was called "Recipe For The Remains Of Eddie Polec". For those
of you who didn't know, Eddie Polec was the name of the boy who was
beaten. In the article, which was more like a poem, one of the lines
went something like "put his head in an oven, and to 350 degrees you
will heat....poor white trash is the best white meat...". Of course,
this was a little much, and I don't agree with it, but 200 years ago
some great men granted her with the freedom of speech. I think it was
Voltaire who said "I may not agree with what you say, but I will 
defend your right to say it until my death." 
        People started talking, and copies of the paper got around
like a bad case of crabs. Which put our schools administration under
some heat, and of course they had to take action. And they determined
that hers, and the others punishment was to be what I think turned 
out into a 5 day suspension. The reason for the suspension wasn't for
what she said, or what she did, but it was for "creating a
disturbance". If you ask may, she is a such a freak that her coming 
to school every day is a disturbance. She wears pipe cleaners in her
hair and pillow cases on her head, but as a junior in high school, 
when school gets out she goes to the University of Pennsylvania to 
take a college math class, and also scored 1560 on her SAT's.
        I think the bottom line is that for years schools have been
trying to put a choke-hold on the students freedom of speech and
expression. There is the case where a principal cancelled a schools
dance because an inter-racial couple was attending. And the case were
a kid was put in educational confinement for wearing a nose ring. And
although this was not as highly publicized it's all the same 
bullshit.
        What do I credit this all too? I once had an art teacher, who
had long hair and earrings, and was never a popular figure with the
administration. Well, one day in class we were listening to Howard
Stern and Stern was making fun of jews. There was a jewish kid in the
class who was upset by it, he had his mom call the principal, and 
the next day we had a new art teacher. Schools aren't happy with a 
kid, and they are looking for the smallest thing with which they can
attack the student with. 
        I'm on the schools newspaper staff, and I'm sick of reading
the shit they publish every month, and I imagine there is a pretty
big fist hovering over the top of the editor. It's time someone spoke
out for our rights. The girl who wrote Freaks Anonymous was actually
motivate by her suspension, which is justified. She is planning on 
having the next issue cause even more uproar then the first. So, if 
you have any interest in speaking out or are just a person who likes
to write poetry or something of the sort, then you can contact the 
editor at SLYPOLY@AOL.COM. Or you can contact me at 
BUFFALOCHI@AOL.COM, and don't forget...Anarchy Is The Best Policy.

HOW NOT GET CAUGHT WITH DRUGS BY TRiP:

       Ok I am going to explain a few things you need to know if you travel 
alot with drugs on you. The first thing to do is never travel with bowls, 
bong, or other paraphernalia.  Always just travel with rolled joints. The 
reason for this is you can easily eat them. Bowls and such are harder to hide 
and get rid of. And there are also extra charges for having paraphernalia. This 
can also be done with other drugs too, though I do not suggest you travel with 
or use any illegal substances. And now another thing is if you do travel with 
any drugs on you often, it is not a good idea to have stickers on your car. 
Police and especially state police and highway patrol officers are trained to 
look for stickers of like peace signs, bands, and alot of the symbols and 
characters the Grateful Dead use, such as dancing bears, roses, skeletons, 
the Steal Your Face album cover, and Jerry stickers. So try to stay 
sticker-free, but if you must have them(as I  do) Don't have anything you 
can't get rid of quickly and don't speed. Drive safe and keep an eye in the 
mirror.

    Ok...here we go and get another look into the sick and demented mind of
the CAFBL writer. See not everyone has the right touch to be a writer.
Different things can exclude you from the select few. i.e. 1: No life what
so ever.2: No chance of life.3:Small Balls.4:No imiganation....these and many
more are reasond for the exclusion of people. Well back to our minds...some of
us are truly demented...while some of us do this stuff for fun...take you
pick...both are pretty cool.
                  First of all let me tell you about me since this is my first
writing. I am NOT a "/<-rad d00d" nor have, want, will, or ever think of
being one. Let me make that clear. I am NOT a Warez Puppie. I do like to read
older stuff from groups like, Vas, Cult Of The Dead Cow or cDc, and X-CRETE.
These Mags are what inspired me to become a writer.

         Ok...now onward to the "MALL". The mall is a place of many fun
opportunities. First there is sears. The easiest place to get away with stuff,
you can hack into the computers or just format some drives. Next you go to the
hardware department and, knock stuff over...break the riding mowers, ride the
bikes around the store. Stuff you can't get kicked out for but really piss
the workers off. Next you go to the clothes department and steal those clip
things that come on jackets[You can sell them to all of those p-hat guys].
Next you go into the dressing room and mark your territory by pissing all over
the place. Then Leave Sears.
         Next go to Sam Goodies or some other music store. You Peel off one of
those alarm stickers of a tape or cd. You put the cd or tape in your pocket
and stick the alarm thing on someone. When they walk out "BEEP" While they are
getting strip searched you leave.
         Ok...now we are up to the arcade. You can get away with alot in the
arcade. First you go to the "Skeet Ball" Machine and reach in the coin return
part[Your hand should fit]. You will fell a metal box. On the side will be a
small arm made of round steel. You pull on that you get a free game. You can't
take a long time doing this or they will catch you. Next...on the bottom of
pinball machines there is a switch that will turn the game on or off. Sometimes
when you turn it off and on it will give you a free game.
         Next, for a good laugh, go to any software store where the workers
know nothing about computers. Well anyway you go in and ask for MS-DOS 8.0.
There is nothing more fun than seeing them frantically searching the store
