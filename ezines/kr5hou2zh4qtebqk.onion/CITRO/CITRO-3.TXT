        Well what can I say, every one has been damn kEwL and written 
articles ! All the people who have written stuph for this issue of the 
CiTR0NiC Journal are hArDc0Re eLeEt dewdz !! You guyz are great ! In 
fact I got so many I am keeping some for Citro-4 !! But this is no 
excuse to stop writing! So get typing and amaze me some more !! Citro-3
is damn big ! I just hope this isn't a peak :)

        There's definitely an international flavour to CiTR0NiC's 
usually UK based info this month. Zircon and Sparhawk are making it 
slightly less safe to live in Canada, King_Dan is making it slightly 
less safe to use Australian servers, Bleach is making it slightly less 
safe to go shopping in the USA and BooYaa, ><-Phyle and Frequency are 
slightly less safe - proving insanity was a UK export.

        I am no longer at home, I have left for the great university 
life. And no, I am not gonna tell you which one 'cos the Sysadmin will 
shit himself and their will be a major security clampdown, which is 
really the last thing I could do with :)

        Anyway, this does mean my personal machine has been relugated to a 
286 (yeeeeuuuuuccckkkkk) but the new UNIX net is damn kEwL. This also 
means I do not have access to a modem/phone line so I am restricted to 
Internet, which is not a bad thing in itself but I'm gonna lose contact 
with some people who only call BBSs :( This does mean though I get a 500
quid interest free overdraft !!!! Hmmmm, can't be all that bad.

        0K, time for my one tiny gripe for the issue. On IRC I was 
chatting to this dewd who was saying that h/p is ded because all the holes 
have been patched and everyone is getting caught, not like in the good 
'ole days etc etc etc. Frankly this attitude is for people who can't be 
bothered to find stuff out for themselves. As technology becomes more
complex it *is* becoming more difficult to exploit faults in a system
(whatever it may be), however, with increased complexity comes an
increased amount of faults. So there are more to find. They may be more
difficult to exploit but that's what hacks and phreaks live on - a
challenge! H/P is far from ded it's just entering a new age :))))

                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This is the section for any rumours or quick info items you may 
have. Any useful bits of info that aren't big enough to justify an 
article can be put here. Just mail 'em to me. All submissions will be 
attributed.

o By changing the ethernet address of your machine to that of the
supervisors machine on Novel you would recieve his/her data packets,
depending of course if the packets physically came past your machine
before the genuine supervisors. This was just from a discussion with a
government employed TCP/IP 'expert' - just a theory he was playing with,
he said the ethernet address could be changed in memory to fool Novel.
Hmmmmm.....

o 80% of the systems I have been on recently (about 20 or so) have not 
patched at least one of the security flaws as mentioned in the 8lgm 
documents... Just thought I'd point it out :)

o If you're gonna be bugged by the government - you WONT know. Trust me, 
if you suspect you're being bugged, you are probably being monitored by 
a private agency, amateurs, or by police who are unathourised to bug 
you. I talked to a copper about this !

o BoW are dead. This is completely untrue. From what I have been told by 
(reliable) sources, Pluvius is just looking for a place to live at the 
moment, and things are gonna kick off again when stuff has calmed down 
again. So d0nT Unl0cK y0uR w4r3z !!! Keep Phearing ! :-)

o 0K, here is a quick but VERY important tip for the beige boxing fans 
amongst you ! Before you clip your phone onto the prosective line, check 
out the site, check for hiding places and escape routes. Whilst beiging 
down by a local building firm on a Sunday a car pulled up in the drive 
and a bloke got out (I was behind a porta-cabin at the time). However as 
I hadn't checked the place out before hand the only escape route I could 
see would mean I would of had to run thru his line of site. So I had to 
simply duck under the porta-cabin and sit tight, luckily he only stayed 
5 mins and then left. Afterwards I had a quick check around and 
discovered another line that was situated so that if some-one else 
arrived I would have an easy out-of-sight escape route. Another point is 
only have out what you need. having some-one arrive whilst you have 
masking tape, stanley knife, cable and stuff on the floor wastes 
valuable seconds. After you have used something put it back in your 
rucksack/pocket/whatever so you only have to declip the phone/computer 
and run ! Some common sense advice, which most people (including me) 
usually ignore.

o There is a still a way to box global from the UK. This is 100% true, I
know people who do it... And no, I don't know how to (whats the point
when I don't have my own phone line.....) so don't hassle me !

                          Laying Seige to Novell
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         
                                    by

                                 Frequency

        Okey Dokey then, Novell networks are becoming more and more 
common and now there are quite a few on dailups not to mention virtually 
all colleges having them. I take it ya know a fair bit about novell and 
just wanna hack it so here goez.

        Right the good thing about Novell iz that if you are actually 
where the network iz (like skool or college etc..) It is quite easy to 
hack herez why.


--------------------------------Server--------------------------------
            I                                            I
            I                                            I
            I_______ T1 _________ T2 _____________ T3 ___I
            

        This iz an over simplified diagram of the network (I'm talking 
Netware V3.11 here which is the latest I fink) and as you can see it iz 
in a daisy chain type setup which ALL Novell networks need to be in. Now 
the good thing about this iz that there iz only 1 cable going between 
each computer which loox summit like this:-

                                00  <<<<<<<<<< Outercable
                            0        0
                           0     X <<<0<<<<< Inner cable.
                            0        0 
                                00

        Ok so my ascii art ain't a legend but it gets the point accross. 
So the cable iz Co-Axial (or very similar) and this means that say the 
supervisor (who has all priviledge rights) is logged onto Terminal T2 then 
all the data packets to and from his/her machine will have to travel thru 
T1 and T3. So (depending on how stupid ya are) you may be thinkin well how 
da fuck doez that work then, well all the packets are coded for each 
machine and the IPX driver in Novell instructs the ethernet card in the 
back of ya PeeCee to only read the packets for the area you are in and so 
the Supervisor packets go floating past. So the quickest way to get around 
this "problem" is to recode ya ipx driver?? Well almost but that would be 
fairly complicated and also the actual long word that contains the 
password (see l8r in article for more info) may be encrypted. The best 
thing to do iz to read and record the supervisor packets and then you can 
re-send them with some alterations, this iz actually quite difficuilt but 
fortunately some bloke haz already done it and there iz a phile called 
hack.exe which doez precisely that (included in Phrack 45) so all you have 
to do iz load it up when the supervisor in logged on and then you can 
create/delete/alter areas as if you were the supervisor, most people will 
probably want to set up a new area and grant it with supervisor privs.

        Thats iz just one way to hack /\/ovell and although it may be 
the easiest it may now work. The actual logon procedure iz not a 
millions milez away from UNIX. Once the ipx and netx drivers are loaded 
you run a program called login.exe (original or what) and the you are 
prompted for the user id and then the password. As stated the actual 
password iz actually encrypted (one way) into a 32 bit long word (long 
wordz do tend to be 32 bit;-)) ) and so if you forget it there iz no way 
you can get it back and not even the supervisor can find it out although 
s/he can change your password to a new one. It iz very hard to hack the 
actual password proggy as 
a) it doesn't tell if the username/password were right (pretty standard 
theze dayz) and 
b) it iz very tricky to call the actual open library to try and crack 
it. You could for example type

C:\NETWARE> logon frequency

and then you would simply have to put the password in however you 
obviously can't go

C:\NETWARE> logon frequency password

as any twat could write a cracker that just changed ya password. This 
fact also makes it quite tricky to write a trojan program coz once they 
have put the real name + password into your trojan there iz no way you 
can then call the logon program and dump a buffer to it with the userid 
+ password that you grabbed. B4 I knew all this shit I wrote a trojan in 
C and it just looked like you got the password wrong but the smart 
people will catch on (some rodent grassed me up and I almost got 
expelled tut tut).

        So anyway there iz a programme to hack /\/ovell called netcrack 
which trys one password after another and thou it doez work (I know I've 
tried) it takes ages as most password are 6 char + and also it only 
tries A to Z and 0 to 9, when any half knowledgeable person would put a 
hash sign or summit in there just to stop this kinda thing.

        I once saw a patched attach command (say i waz logged into area 
frequency and I wanted to log into area supervisor I could just type 
attach and then enter the appropriate password and it would connect me 
without appearing to logout and back in a again) where by you didn't 
have to type the password hoiwever it didn't work and I think /\/ovell 
may have patched in there more recent releases (3.04 to 3.11 are patched 
I fink).

        So anyway if you want any of the proggys mentioned just tell me 
and I'll give em to ya the hack.exe one doez work (I've supervisor privs 
at my college at the mo;-)) ).

Problems        Problems        Problems        Problems       Problems

        Ok now our technician haz tried to stop me and my aquainences 
hacking the network (fighting a losing battle I might add) by doing some 
of the following thingz, I've listed them and also put how to get around 
them.

1) Remap A: drive to back to the network meaning that if I go dir a: I 
get the directory of the network drive meaning I can't load any proggies 
or save/copy shit etc...

2) Wipe filez "userlist", "session" and "syscon" from the network (theze 
utils allow you to see who else is logged on and also look at all the 
users on the network.)

3) Attempt to cut thingz off in both the autoexec.bat and the user 
script which iz executed whenever you log onto an area.

4) Attempted to completely get rid of our DOS access by writting batch 
filez whereby if you log out or whatever you will simply be returned to 
the login prompt (thats with BREAK on)

1) Ok now thiz waz quite a sneaky move and it stumped me for a while 
there are two things you can do 
a) copy whatever you want onto the c drive B4 you log in. This means 
that he hasn't had chance to remap the A: drive and they alwayz have 
drive C open for ppls work etc.. or 
b) simply access the b: drive, yeah simple init but he didn't realise 
that if you just have 1 floppy drive drive a and b are mapped to the 
same physical drive, quite kewl.

2) Hmm not a lot you can do here I have copies of all theze philez and 
your welcome to them, very useful for seeing if the supervisor iz logged 
on when using hack.exe.

3) Yep this iz one you should be aware of THE LOGIN SCRIPT CANNOT BE 
TERMINATED so if he haz put summit in the login script you cannot 
terminate it (unlike Ctrl-Alt-Del on autoexec.bat). However not all 
programmez will run from the script and so he may insert the line exit 
"autoexec.bat" which will quit the script and run the autoexec.bat (for 
the area not the machinez own) this CAN be terminated. BTW if you need 
to alter you login script and he haz wiped syscon you can find it 
located in the P: drive in soime directory like P:\Mail\57000003\ under 
some name which I forget. 

4) Just terminate em (Ctrl-Alt-Del)

        Okay you should now be able to get supervisor privs and wipe all 
thoze annoying 1st years work but don't get caught.

BTW: you can now get Novell netware client software for the vastly 
superior Amigaz. this meanz you can hook ya miggy up to a novell server 
and also run all Netware utils etc ke\/\/l.

If ya feel the need (maybe to get some of the programmes) you can 
contact me thru any member of Citronic or on the following Boardz:-

                 A guide to security for hackers/phreaks
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                    by

Right this is gonna be the second time I've written, and I'm not pleased 
about it. Christ being paranoid can have it's limits (i.e. I erased the 
original once I'd given it to Harl, only to find out the bloody zip file 
wuz corrupted)

Okay, let's get it on. How secure do you think you are? Well you may be 
mocking the latest send mail bug, or abusing those at&t calling cards 
till the cows come home, but just how secure are you? Okay, so what if 
you don't tell everyone in the street that you can make calls to America 
or that "Wargames" was based on you, you'd be surprise how insecure you 
are.

Put it this way, let's say you favourite organisation e.g. Police, NSA, 
etc.. comes to your house, could they find anything in your house to 
insinuate you? Well if I were you I'd check through my checklist first 
just incase.

1) Firstly it's all well PGPing your mail, but I bet all your h/p philes 
are laid bare huh? Yeah, yeah so what if you PGP it all I bet you'd 
prefer a much more easier life right? Well how about a on-the-fly 
encryptor whose encryption is based on the same technique as PGP. 
SecureDrive is a sinch to install and set up, and as a bonus a copy will 
be included in Citro-4 !

[Sorry this is due to space limitations ! Its over 100k long, so Citro-4
 may be a little bigger than usual - HarLeQuin]

2) I bet your warez is bare, and can be seen just by doing a dir a:, 
again SecureDrive comes to the rescue, it can distinguish between 
encrypted floppies and normal stuff. Plus since I've been using it I 
don't think it requires any extra filespace.

3) Okay you've installed SecureDrive but what about those other files on 
the non-encrypted drive. Last month in one of the sections of CiTR0NiC 
recommended a program called SHRED by S&S, I tested it and found it to 
be abit insecure, okay maybe it's just me, but I hate file shredding 
programs that leave the original filename, filesize, date, and time. So 
what if the file is completely empty... WIPEINFO from nortons does leave 
it absolutely clear. Heres a test to evaluate your file shredder, first 
shred the offending file, then undelete. If the now try to restore by 
giving the 1st character of the file, exam firstly if the filename is 
the same, i.e. ?ENDMAIL.BUG you got probs. Also I would seriously panic 
if you managed to restore the file to it's entireity, as that could mean 
"mirror" or some other backup program is managing to keep a copy of the 
file, so disable the program.

4) Now start you got to keep copies of those passphrases for floppy and 
harddisk keys, leave it with someone who you trust completely. This 
means not direct family i.e. brothers, sisters, etc.., or girlfriends, 
boyfriends (you'd be surprise how nasty people can get when you split up 
we them). Why do you have to leave a copy of your passphrases? Simply 
because you might forget them, and leaving copy anywhere in your house 
would be like entering the passphrases in front of the cops and letting 
them view it all.

5) Shred, Burn, eat those print outs, enter in those little info bits 
you got in your notebook and burn that too. Don't throw it outside, 
because if you read CiTR0NiC #2 you'll know why.

6) Pat youself on the back for complete the whole checklist, now you did 
remember to WIPEINFO those files on the unencrypted drive right?

SecureDrive will be included in the CiTR0NiC Journal #4, it's freeware 
which makes it great for all of us.

[ This is a *damn* good program I highly recommend its use !! ]

               \ \   Zircon - Aka - Tha Meat Axe   / /   
                \/\_______________________________/\/   

   Ok Zircon here, with my first artical for Citro '94.. Noticed nothing 
had done with pranks 'n' stuff....so i decided to have some fun. In this 
article i will cover some misc. pranks that will keep you amused in a 
very boring situation.
      First Prank - Bored on halloween? Wanna scare the shit outa someone? 

Well here's a great little trick that'll bring you lots of laughs!
   Materials Needed 

   1] A golf ball (not the explosive type ;))
   2] A roadway with two trees/lamp polls on either side
   3] A white sheet, or any object that would scare the shit out of you 
      if you suddenly saw it while driving down the road
   4] Tradition - the iq slightly higher than a rock

  Pulling The Prank - Break open the golf ball with a vice or similar 
tool. Inside you will find a huge ball made up of elasic. Unwind this 
elastic and move on to the next step.

   *Note* Instead of the long elastic, you could use string, i prefer the 
elastic becasuse of how FAR it can go, also it's fun for other stuff;)
Next tie the string/elastic to two tries. One on one side of a road, 
one on the other. For those of you that do not meet material #4 here is 
a diagram

                 |   /    \   |
         Tree -> |\__________/| <- Tree
                 | /^String^\ |
                  /          \
                 / <-Street-> \

  Gawd i hope that works;) ok now on to the next part. Make a ghost or 
something out of the sheet/paper or just leave it like it is. Attact it 
somehow to the middle of the elastic. And there you have it, a FLOATING 
sheet/piece of paper, well it looks that way to cars in the night;)
  
  So now when cars drive by at night, they will slow down or stop 
(wouldn't you if you saw something hovering in the middle of the road?) 
this is quite funny to watch, and hey, spice it up, eg the car when it 
slows down or something, be creative.

  *Note* Don't use a white string, it'll show up in the cars headlights, 
also, if it is a two way street, you may want to move the ghost to the 
left or the right. Also do not use a HUGE sheet, as the elastic will not 
hold it, i usually use a piece of paper, and then chuck fire crackers;) 
that wakes em up.
                             
  Second Prank - Using a variation of the above, a very funny trick can 
be played!

  Materials Needed

  1] Fishing line, this should be non colored, and not too think. It 
     should be strong enough for you to pull on it with your hands and 
     it not break. 
  2] Some thumb tacks or staple gun.

  Pulling The Prank - This is a simple prank to set up. Simply find a 
door (usually a persons front door, or whatever door is used most) and 
cut a legnth of fishing line, long enough to fit accross the door. Then 
tack or staple one end of the line to one side of the door frame at the 
height of the average persons chest (do not put it where someones neck 
may be, although if yer sick like me, go ahead;) ). Then tack or staple 
the other end of the line to the opposite side. Again for you stupid 
people, here's a lame drawing.

              ______    +'s Are Staple's Or Tacks.
             |      |
           +-|------|-+ 
      Line / |      |  <- Door
             |______|

  *Note* If you are using tacks, make sure they are in GOOD and tight. 
You may even want to tap them with a hammer or rock. You do NOT want the 
line to slip out.

  Well as you can probably guess, this is a modified version, used to 
scare the shit out of someone! Almost like walking into one of those 
automatice opening doors, when it doesn't open. Very funny!

    
  Third Prank - This is my personal favourite prank, and have seen it 
done twice, the person that got 'pranked' was so freaked out that they 
threw up! although this may require some guts, the effore is worht it, 
believe me!

  Materials Needed 

  1] The head of an animal, the two that i have seen used are a shark 
     head, and a pig's head. If you're wondering WHERE DO I GET THAT?! 
     well, we got ours from a chineese restuarant, who just happen to 
     have left overs;)
  
  2] A public, school, or gas station washroom. Anywhere where there's 
     many people flowing through, the two i saw where done in a school.

  Pulling The Prank - Well this one you should have figured out by now! 
Simply carry the animals head into the washroom, using a back pack or 
such lined with a plastic bad. Then place the animals head, face up 
inside the toilet. Close the lid, walk away, and get ready for a big 
scream! Just imagine going to take a piss, and a shark's head peers up 
at you! Like i said the last victim i saw, was so freaked out, she threw 
up! Wicked prank! Oh yea sorry, no diagram, i figure you know what a 
toilet looks like!

  Fourth Prank - Classroom fun! This is a wicked trick to play when yer 
so bored you'de rather be fucking the 70 year old teacher! Male or 
female! This is also great for substitutes/fill ins.

  Pulling The Prank - no materials are needed at all, just a group that 
you have filled in on the prank. Ok when the teacher turns their back on 
the crowd, let out a slow, Mooooooooooo (like a cow). The teacher will 
usually glance behind him/her and then continue what they were doing. 
Then signal two more people accross the room, and all three of you let 
out another Moooooooo. Once again the teacher will turn around, and tell 
you to shut up or something, just wait untill they turn back around. 
Signal some more people and keep going untill the teacher gets REALLY 
mad! We've used this a lot in my class, and had teachers get so IRATE 
that they've walked outa class! Then of course we proceeded to have a 
HUGE paper fight;)

   Anyway that's all the pranks for now, hope they're fun, i tried not to 
use some of the more common, boring ones. Well cya next time,

                                                         Zircon

  Btw - All rights have been fuqed to hell by the meat axe!

                         Physical Site 'Hacking'
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                    by
                                
                                HarLeQuin
        

        There have been 100's of philes on hacking this system and that 
system and so on.... but very few on getting physical access to 
computerz.... This is almost as good as hacking a site remotely and has
many advantages. Basically it requires 3 *essential* things.


o Guts
o Social Engineering Skills
o Guts


Smile and be nice
-----------------

        0K, lets say you wanted to get to a terminal in a protected 
building. The building has security guards and swipe card systems. First 
of all you've got to be able to fool the security guards. Machines are 
hilariuosly easy to fool compared to humans (hell, if ya didn't know 
that you wouldn't be a hacker right ???). Basically it boils down to 
looking convincing and being confident. This is where a little 
background research helps out.

        For example whilst waiting around the foyer of a certain UK 
phone companies large office block pretending to be waiting for a lift 
home off some-one I noticed that employee's who had forgotten their 
swipe cards could sign out a guest one for the day. The book that needed 
to be signed went back some 50 or so pages (nearly a year) and so had 
employees names and signatures. So, several days later I returned in a 
nice shirt and tie with a piece of toast in my mouth complaining about 
what a rush I was in and, oh, dammit, I have forgotten my pass. So I 
grab the book, look 20 or so pages back. Find an easy signature (not 
that they probably check) and sign out a guest pass. Easy huh ? I got
past the swipe card door, and promptly spent the next 20 minutes
shitting myself in case some-one decided a small gray cell was more
appropriate for me than a large carpeted office block. The point is
though, because I looked confident, I was convincing. This works
especially in large corporations and organisations where the
security/reception personnel will not reognise individual employees.

        Looking the part is also extremely important. I relate another
example. A computer and some software was stolen from a local computer
shop. Hmmm, nothing special, but it was in broad daylight. Some-one
walked in with an overall and a phoney ID card and said words to the
effect of:

'Hi I'm from FixTek computer maintenance and I've been asked to pick up
a PC for hard-drive maintenance'

The hapless shop assistant merely agrees and lets him take a computer!!
The thief then returned two hours later and said

'Sorry, I forgot I also need to take some software with me to set the
machine up. I'll need this this this and this.'

And so walked out with another few hundred pounds worth of software.
The theft wasn't discovered for two days and it even got in the local
paper. Again the moral of the story. Confidence and Acurracy.

        It is a good idea to have a story prepared, so you know it 
inside out - even start beleiving it yourself. 'Look Mister-Security 
Guard, I lost my access card and its the fourth time, if I lose another 
one I get a right rollicking, so Tommy over in Admin lent me his, just 
for the afternoon, you know how it is, I mean, you probably get more 
hassle from them up stairs than we do !'

        Only as a very last resort do you run like buggery. Doing this
automatically confirms your guilt of dodgy goings on. Quietly slipping
away is much more effective - 'I just need to nip to the toilet, I'll go
now while your sorting this out, won't be a sec'.

Deft Hands and More Smiling
---------------------------
        
        The best way to get into University labs is in the beggining of
term... 'Oh I haven't got an I card yet but I have a residents temporary
ID card, will that do ?' - 99% of the time it will do, because 99% of
security guards no very little about the actual workings of an
organisation. They just 'do the doors'. Also if you are caught on a
machine your not supposed to be on, looking embarrased and saying 'I am
so sorry, I didn't realise' works very well - 'I was just looking for
something to type my project on'.

        So find out when new employees/students/members arrive and use 
this to your advantage. Also scamming the newbies works well. 'Could I 
just check your key number...? Right, ahhh, you seem to have a duplicate 
key, can I take your details and I'll send you a unique one tomorrow, 
sorry we had a few like this... always happens, Thanks'.

        In a computer lab near where I used to live there were rows and 
rows of computers connected to the big UNIX box by serial cables. So we 
used to hang around wait to some-one tryed to connect to the server, sit 
next to them and then pull the cables out the back of the computer with 
our feet. The terminal emulator would freeze, I would chirp up with a 
quick 'Oh the technician said that one wasn't working very well you'll 
want to try another'. Then put a notice of the PC (without switching it 
off) saying Do Not Touch - Needs Maintenenace. And then simply wait for 
the person to leave and voila - one UNIX account....

        Also niftily 'borrowing' cards, keys and other access devices is 
quick, easy and useful for that system you need access to for once only. 
Waiting by a door for someone to go thru (tieing a shoe-lace or 
adjusting a tie) and then slipping in after them also gets the job done.

Darkness, Bolt-Cutters and Crowbars 
----------------------------------- 

        Usually the least effective method. Physically breaking in to a 
site. Clumsy, Barbaric and worthy of no-one but the common-thief. I 
wouldn't recommend it. This method has no style and can get you free 
food, accomodation (and an extremely strict curfew) on behalf of your 
respective law enforcement agencies.

k0nClUsi0n
----------
        
        At first site it looks like there is more chance of getting
caught than if you dialled up and screwed the system. However, this is
not always possible. I have also come closer to getting busted by
'remote' hacking than by wandering into buildings. No-one would suspect
some-one is gonna hack their system by walking in and sitting down at a
terminal in broad daylight. As the world in general wises up to the
hacking fraternity and logs, traces and mail reading becomes the norm,
perhaps the more direct (and less suspicous) route has to be taken.

        y0y0y0! Its that Canadian guy! Up for grabs in this article is 
how to make a Drano bomb! That's right all you little Phuckers! 
Non-flammable explosive fun! This is perfect for those little country 
mailboxes, and also those newspaper mailboxes that you always see the 
pop bottle sticking out of.

          DISCLAIMER: THIS IS DONE BY NON-EXPERIENCED AMATEURS.
                PROFESSIONALS SHOULD NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.

That done, we'll give you the leet list of neccessary household items:

WHAT U N33D N STUPH:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Crystal Drano
        *PLASTIC* pop or Evian bottle, 500ml-2L
        Water
        Brain *slightly* larger than grendel's: NOTE: This can be 
        obtained at your local meat market

WHAT U D0 N STUPH:        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        

1) Clean out the bottle completely and fill it 2/3 full with water.
2) Take a big piece of aluminum foil and crumple it into little 3/4cm 
   balls. make them moderately loose, or moderately tight, whichever you 
   prefer.
3) Drop them into the bottle. Hopefully they will stay at the surface.
4) Do enuff so that they completely cover the surface, and then drop in 
   a couple more so it looks like this:

                                {    }
                                {    }
                               /      \
                             (          )
                             |          |
                             |oooooooooo|       <- Dah Aluminum Ballz
                             |±±±±±±±±±±|
                             |±±±±±±±±±±|
                             |±±±±±±±±±±|       <- Dah H2O
                             |±±±±±±±±±±|
                             |±±±±±±±±±±|
                             `----------'


5) Take the can of Drano and your bottle and you cap to the site where 
   you want to let it off.
6) Clear the area of any small children and pets.
7) Get a friend to hold the bottle and get ready to cap the top.
6) Pour Drano in until you can feel it getting hot and it starts to 
   bubble.
7) Quickly, put the cap on the bottle TIGHT.
6) Shake it TWICE. These take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes to 
   go off, so don't sit there shaking it for 3 minutes.
7) Drop/Throw and run about 10/20 metres away so you don't get sprayed.

        This should blow in anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 1/2 minutes. 

Some fly into the air, some just make a boom.
        The way this thing works is that the water reacts with the 

Drano, but the process is accelerated by the excessive amounts of 
aluminum foil in there. You'll notice when you use Drano normally, your 
pipes get really hot. This is essentially the same thing, except the 
bottle isn't open-ended to let the force out. You'll also notice that 
when you look into the crystal Drano, you see little bits of metallic 
stuph. That's aluminum. Hence, if we put more aluminum foil in it, the 
reaction will be sped up.

NOTEZ N STUPH:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Most people say "Drano? I don't have no Drano! Our drains don't 
clog!". What I say to this is open up your cupboard and check... My 
house is the only house I have ever been to that doesn't have Drano. 
Crystal works way better than Liquid, but I SUPPOSE this will do if you 
have nothing else.

        The reason I say a plastic pop bottle is kinda obvious... when a 
Everfresh bottle blows up, it sprays phragments of this little thing 
called _glass_. The plastic won't phragment, so you can stand where you 
can see the bomb if you're not using glass.

        Water: go to your local sink and rotate the right tap thingy 
counter- clockwise. Collect the substance that comes out.

        It is possible to do it yourself... I have done this many timez 
when my friends were too chickenshit.

        You can also use a 2L bottle, but these take MUCH longer to go 
off. And about half the time, the plastic melts before it gets a chance 
to build up enuff pressure to blow.

        REMEMBER: THIS BOMB IS CORROSIVE. My friend, who didn't know the 
dangers of corrosive acids, kicked the already blown bomb at me and it 
burned right through my shirt. If this happens to you, it will start to 
feel like you have all kinds of needles poking. Run home or to the 
nearest store and pour milk on the spots. acid+base=neutralized.
        
        DO NOT TOUCH THE BOMB AFTER IT HAS GONE OFF. You are liable to 
burn your skin off.

        I think that's it... Have phun!

                    Carding During The Holiday Season
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

             Special Thanx To Weezer For Giving Me This Idea


DISCLAIMER: This file is strictly for information purposes. If you are 
caught for doing anything in this file, then "BLEACH" will not be hold 
responsible. The information itself is not illegal, but if you do this 
then you will be commiting a crime. Also, this is how it is in the USA. 
It may not be like this in any other country.
Carding. The thing that holds the worst reputation in the H/P community. 
Many Hackers and Phreaks believe that it is the Fraudulant use of a 
Credit Card that makes our cause look bad. Even though many of them say 
it, many of them do it too. I am not saying that carding is right or 
wrong. It is stealing, but if it is for your cause then you should do 
it. The Holiday Season is the best time to do this.
There are many reasons that this Holiday season is a great time to card.
The first reason for this is the stupidity of the stores during the 
Holiday Season. Where I live I have a few friends who enjoy trashing for 
shitloads of things,(I myself do not like trashing because sometimes it 
is too much trouble for what it is worth). But when my associate, (who 
shall remain nameless), made a good discovery. He has been trashing for 
some while and he usually finds ripped up receipts which he tapes 
together and gets the card information. Well like two weeks ago when the 
Christmas shopping season started here, he went carding. I received a 
phone call from him from a payphone. When I talked to him, he told me 
that the receipts weren't ripped. I ended up thinking this was a fluke, 
but it has been like this ever since and doesn't show any signs of 
stopping. The only thing better than not ripped up receipts, is not 
ripped up receipts during the holiday season. The reason for that 
statement is that during the Christmas Season, more people purchase 
things with Credit Cards, so there are even MORE receipts.
The second good reason is that stores are busier during the Holiday 
season. When a store receives many orders at once, and they need to ship 
them out next day air, or second day air, then they have even less time 
to check out the Card then they did before. This does not mean you can't 
get caught, it is just stating that the chances are lower.
I would recommend trashing at a store with either a lot of Credit Card 
orders or a store that you think you would like to card from. The 
explanation for the first part is self explanatory. The places with more 
Credit Card orders means more receipts. Now the second part is basically 
somewhat simple too. When you receive credit card receipts from people 
who shop at the store that you wish to card from, then it will be easier 
to receive what you wish. When someone purchases something from a store 
and pays for the order and does not show that they have bad credit, then 
the store will let them purchase more from there and deliver it quicker. 
This is because the store trusts you and wants to keep you as a customer.
The final part is probably the most important thing in all of carding, 
and that is the drop off point. At the drop off point you want to make 
sure either the house is empty, or the people are at work while the 
delivery comes. If you decide to use an empty house, don't use a house 
that anyone would know it was empty from a mile away. Things that give 
it away are large windows with no shades what so ever, Grass that is 
very high, and any real bad damages, (broken windows,trashed siding, 
etc). Stay away from those types of houses. We once sent something to an 
empty house and the UPS delivery guy would not drop it off because the 
house seemed too empty. You also want to be positive that the house IS 
empty. If you assume the house is empty and never look into it then you 
could be wrong. This is all spoken from experience. One of my associates 
carding a nice pair of expensive roller blades. He sent it to what he 
thought was an empty house. He thought they never delivered it. Like two 
weeks later he found out that some old lady received a pair of brand 
new, expensive roller blades, and was freaking out because she never 
ordered them. The more dangerous way of getting caught through a drop 
off point, but more likely for the product to be delivered is sending it 
to a house where some- one lives, but does not get home until after all 
the delivery men are usually through with their routes. This is a good 
plan because you can simply leave a note on the door for the delivery 
guy and they will be less suspicious. You can easily get caught doing 
this though. I mean, fate fucks you over sometimes and the person can be 
home sick one day. If the person is home one day, then they can just set 
you up to try to pick up the package. That happened to another associate 
of mine. He went into their yard to pick up the package. He almost had 
his hands on it when the guy came running outta the house yelling that 
he was going to call the cops and shit like that. Thankfully my 
associate got away without getting caught.
Another great thing about carding in the Holidays is the drop off points 
are easier. If you live in the Northern US, or anywhere else in America 
where it gets cold, you must know about the wealthy senior citizens who 
go down south like birds for the winter. This leaves a nice empty house 
that does not look suspicious. Again, I am not saying that you couldn't 
be caught, just the chances are lower.
Carding should not be looked on as the scourge of hacking. It just 
should not be over used with greed. Also card smaller things. You 
definitely do not want to get caught and slapped with a grand theft 
charge. That's all for now.

                      The Last Temptation of Zircon

[I had to publish this 'cos it was so damn funny ! You'll never be able
to look at a pudding again without laughing ! Zircon certainly has a way
with words - HarLeQuin]

        Standing, undressing her with his eyes, Vixen can feel a rush of 
pleasure rush over her body as Zircon begins to gently corress her earlobe 
with his tounge. She turns around in a slow and passionate movement and 
jumps into Zircon's arms as he procedes to the bed.

        Slowly lowering her to the matress, Zircon begins to peel off the 
skimpy layer of silk she has covering her body. Starting at her tracia, 
Zircon slides his steaming tongue down her perfectly smooth body. She begins 
to heat up and can feel herself panting. She reaches out at Zircons jeans 
and madly begins to tear them off. Grabbing wildly at his waits, she thrusts 
him forward and forcefully throwing his meat axe into her love pudding.

        Rolling around on the matress they fall of as one, and tumble onto 
the hardwood floor, where they proceed to do the horizontal mombo for hours 
on end!

According to their own promotional material Talkland is the largest 
independent Service Provider in the UK, and one of the reasons they give 
is their billing schemes for customers. This little article is designed 
to give you an insight into how detailed the cellular billing is, and in 
turn will highlight how they can trace calling patterns etc. on stolen 
ESN/MIN pairs for example.

Talkland will send their monthly bill on floppy disk free of charge (the 
"Talkview interactive billing system") which can be analysed on their 
own custom installed s/w to increase ease of accounting. The bill can 
take many forms, so here we go with a few short examples of how that 
poor business customer's bill looks once you and your friends have 
placed all their calls for the month on his/her ESN/MIN pair...

The s/w, Talkview, is capable of presenting billing information on 5 
hierarchical levels - by company, division, department, cost centre and 
individual user. Of most interest to cell phreaks is the fact that, to 
quote, "All calls across all mobile phones can be broken down by date, 
most frequently dialled number value and so on. As much or as little 
information as you require." This is NOT good news! If for example you 
placed 25 calls to Harl from your standard residential line one month, 
then the next month you called him 0 times on this line, but 80 times 
using your stolen BT Cellnet ESN/MIN pair...BT can easily spot calling 
patterns like this and also from identifying the cell stations the calls 
were placed through they can locate the general area the calls were 
placed from. This information should at least provide them with a 
suitable suspect for closer inspection, and that's the last thing we 
want...be sensible.

Here's an example screen from Talkview's billing information:-

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handset Summary Report from 01/09/94 to 02/10/94
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Report is detailed at Handset level.

                                    <----------- Call Costs -------------
Handset                             | IDD.   STD.    Special  P/W   Total

0831234567, C. ITRONIC              |   0.00   63.38    13.79  0.00   92.
0831345678, P. ULSE                 |   0.00   35.18     1.87  0.00   42.
0831456789, A. PHREAK               |   0.00   44.85     3.04  0.00   47.

-*- end -*-


Now the above method of billing display doesn't present your average 
cell phreak with any problems, as only the set user (employee)'s calls 
are shown, but of course this will highlight abnormal use as records are 
easily compared on a month-to-month basis using the Talkview software. 
The next screen will show you where the problems arise:-

-*- end -*-


From this snippet of a screen in this billing presentation mode you can 
see instantly that each call 'from' (or apparently from!) each single 
handset is logged, the volume of calls to each number is shown also, so 
the example given earlier of 80 calls to Harl on (eg) 0123 456789 would 
stand out like a radioactive kipper, especially when checked against the 
previous months billing information. It has long been believed amongst 
cell phreaks that if they are using an ESN/MIN pair from a large company 
that they will blindly pay their bill and your extra calls will, within 
reason, be paid and subsequently forgotten about. From the (quick) 
research I've done it would appear that this is not the case...at the 
press of a key a manager can check the calling patterns of all the 
phones registered to his firm, and if you did indeed call your mates 
several times voice using a pair billed to the aforementioned business 
he can spot it with great ease and those parties you called illegally 
can expect to hear from either the manager himself or a representative 
of Talkland (or whichever service provider you've defrauded). Better 
hope your mates can keep their mouths' shut!

Basically the rules are simple: calls to modems are probably ok (like 
everything, in moderation) as when checked against no-one will answer 
voice and be subjected to a modern-day spanish inquisition. Voice calls 
to a fellow phreak should be kept to a minimum over this medium, unless 
you're feeling particularly suicidal. Cellular telephone fraud is 
costing the service providers a great deal of money, and they will go to 
some considerable length to track and prosecute offenders...bear this in 
mind and resist the urge to call all your friends 5 times a day to tell 
them that your new OKI and stolen ESN still works, and that all your 
calls are FREE!!! Stay safe and free.

                 The CiTR0NiC Journal is now uploaded to

From the land of legal gear, comes a BBS of dopetastic proportions...

So get it there !

It is also a bot on IRC called lamerbot usually on the #virus channel has
loads of hack/phreak/virus stuff on it aswell. Check us out in the 
misc-zines directory. /msg lamerbot help  gets you started.

PLEASE NOTE: Although at the moment the CiTR0NiC Journal is coming out
monthly, it is *not* a monthly journal, it is published whenever there
is enough material to justify an issue. So instead of nagging me and
stuff (although that works as well!) writing an article will get the
next issue out sooner !

Drop us a line. Even if ya just wanna say Hi or ask a question. As you
may of guessed we're not the sort of ppl who flame others because of our
elitist fantasies. H/P is about communicating ! (and writing articles
for CiTR0NiC !!!) Mail the address below or catch me as Harl on IRC
usually wasting my life hanging around #Phreak, #Virus and #Citro

If yer gonna write an article, don't write bullshit. In other words, if
you want to write on how to do something, then make sure it works...
Personally I have tried and tested everything that I have written
about. So if you're gonna write 'How to build a nuclear bomb', get yer
toolkit out before hand !

Also, I have written a CiTR0NiC World Wide Web page but... I need an 
account to put it on. So if anyone can donate me an account I would be 
eternally grateful. The only problems are that it has to be a legit 
account (as I don't want it go down after a few weeks) and it must allow 
WWW access, but apart from that.... It'll only need about 500k - 1Meg 
quota...

Oh, and anyone who can do a decent ASCII banner for the journal (that I 
can read !) will get a a mention in CiTR0NiC (and therefore memberz of 
the opposite sex throwing themselves at you for the rest of your life) 
and a 15m Swimming Certificate. BTW, a female hacker mailed me saying 
that the boys in her school found out that she had the CiTR0NiC Journal 
on her hard-drive and can now hardly walk down the corridor without some 
boy offering her the chance of making love to him in a swimming pool 
full of jelly (that's jello to the yanks). Also one fatality occured 
when a man walked into a niteclub with a 'eYe cHiLLeD wItH tHe CiTR0NiC
